awesome 17 laptop 's heavy hot sit lap bed samsung tablet , 's heavy hold onto hand issues saw reading reviews figured would serve purpose mainly reading digital books looking around net actually weighs less tablet last good 6 hours battery thing would love windows xp lol made decision reading reviews thanks everyone sharing thoughts asus
finally got cash spent month deciding laptop bang buck budget gaming laptop 've looking n't game either data photo video editing handles also , design i'm public space n't scream gamer 's little heavier 'd like , i'm fragile old man n't really bother everything easily upgradable literally one screw pops reach memory great first screen needs replaced viewing angles awful get another screen 25 replacement looks pretty easy 's like putting together screen replacement n't think 's another laptop build quality power price
really awful super slow buggy reset factory settings , 's still frustrating nightmare wish bought chromebook
battery lasts long touch screen works great
thing lacked hard drive space additional usb ports \( standard chromebooks \) easily come purchasing sd dongle reason n't get 5 minute stuff
's fine work light browsing internet however , incredibly slow often freezes multiple tabs open 're watching youtube netflix videos also chromebook best os cannot download certain things steam , basically requires use chrome else 's useless

computer seems nice , wish could use upon starting getting account connected started install windows updates , failed repeatedly got point said preparing upgrade stuck 9 hours currently working 12 hours total would let modify install programs stuck could n't live either tried restarting computer update status never changed , right 9 computer turned back currently reset process get working least , hopefully wo n't restarting another 12 hour process spend much time right box get run , quite current problematic could computer shipped pre updated \? said , seems like would nice computer ran like 's supposed edit 1 still unable get recent version windows running , running stable older version may try clean install windows i'm looking forward getting drivers thing needs back additional issue , track pad terrible 10 time click still finger track pad , causes cursor across screen without finger pad moving strongly considering returning point highly disappointing nearly 2000 laptop
terrible sticky touch pad could use touch pad return feels slow unresponsive compared higher end laptop cpu guessing cpu specs need matching motherboard utilize websites would load slow everything little delay

workhorse little laptop
first probably last chromebook 1 \) computer arrived pretty much brand new looking finished easily could new computer , except still configured meeting required acer tech support troubleshoot issue hour able login computer 2 \) os update allows use android apps computer however , two apps use crash every time open i'm back accessing browser like apps better , apps n't work thing , despite os description said want access app service , done chrome browser , 3 \) biggest complaint computer keyboard designed keyboard put search button directly left key since number pad , experienced typing center left position dead center position extremely cumbersome using keyboard despite full size additionally putting search button directly left key annoying i'm actually considering key stop accidentally pressing search button wasnt designed location , would 3 star review main value computer , reason 1 star review ease use terms chrome os know chrome , already know computer would nice seller would set back factory stats prior 1 hour life wasted troubleshooting little mix
laptop job bought school related work , easy carry around battery last long time , fast enough running programs related microsoft office aspects n't really like touchpad , fact button sometimes needs pressed working
perfect homework middle also , use draw using adobe program much cheaper ipad pro ! !
pretty decent fastest world trouble many things totally solid research writing papers would n't get device play games stream
paid seems good price get travel computer mostly play overwatch games pass time i3 powerful enough support high end gaming high resolution however lower resolution minimal lag case frills problems screen would expect non 4k laptop

great gaming laptop , best would recommend product lcd screen cheap bad however , graphics gameplay magnificent intel core i7 nvidia geforce gtx battery life okay , would definitely want take charger 're going somewhere design looks normal 's heavy , makes laptop easy travel even take work place school way better gaming laptops although , graphics magnificent , lcd screen trash eyes hours playing gta v pros games run smoothly audio quality quite good cons awful screen gaming laptop
good computer , chromebook means laptop running google chrome os operating system fast user friendly one thing people complain amount space laptop comes , let explain storage small chromebooks use called web apps means need \( accurately , \) download programs said , expect downloading games movies battery life 12 hours \( unless use computer way explain later \) camera looks good , albeit slightly grainy well , frames main focus web apps , would mean online constantly make use laptop course , offline comparable apps find chrome web store ever find without connection want unlock full potential \( quickly run memory \) take advantage fact chromeos linux based install ubuntu get , simply explain possible money , good machine actually enjoy using

less year ordered laptop bad design hinge broken , screen falling ordered two laptops , facing issue one get work go model
love pretty fast nice backlit keyboard sure reviews
event actually received laptop ordered , would perfect review n't happen ordered gtx 1050 ti much specified order bought laptop immediately upon receiving package , felt something , box laptop stated ran base gtx 1050 gpu tests front , mostly gaming \( overwatch , specific \) frame rate 1050 1050ti short , let 's say obvious n't get purchased i'm sorry confusion \? 'll admit 's fantastic piece hardware minus somewhat flimsy plastic design around edges keyboard nitro 5 gaming laptop , intel core i5 7300hq , geforce gtx 1050 ti , 15 6 full hd , 8gb ddr4 , 256gb ssd , 51 screen , aforementioned issue
acer aspire 1 excellent value considering 's affordable cost fine companion dell desk top
got little machine weight great size thin experience going continue turned usual vendors put bloatware stuff make , , impossible use first start disabling intel process consistently taking 40 80 cpu still need look properly turn starts reboot via service updates win10 build 1709 coming either \( though likely windows issue \) end machine win10 1709 available usb think would machine one nice little app though acer care center allowed easily backup factory build drivers
great laptop browsing bought sd card extend offline capability first thought pen useless experience actually great fill like writing paper i'm amazed fast silent !
nice product , works well
keyboard horrible non replaceable anytime type least words missing letters key board pick letter
computer super slow also used total 10 hours max already screen blank get computer come piece junk even think return many months past move middle purchased started really using got screwed money go buy another computer right 12 tonight
returned case felt cheap absolutely hated trackpad two features n't bother , 's solid purchase
little hesitant buy laptop online without trying store reasons , figured could return free , hell give go pros display nice , seems pretty sturdy , size really great students , battery life good , 2 instead one like others , keyboard nice feel , weight really light , mouse either responsive weird zoom scroll thing \( n't figured disable ended getting bluetooth one mouse instead \) , hard drive smaller would like , i'm happy think value definitely money 's nice something easily portable n't require full computer bag
love laptop ! got today big screen fast easy use docs internet done windows
insane ! , n't \? dell amazon com \( yes amazon com \) terrible products laptop fine , mean computer annoyed keep checking thing almost 5 hours updated \? ! computer new , n't operating system necessary programmes date \? consumers experience inconvenience fact forced shame dell shame amazon com ! ! !
've really enjoyed product would 've given higher rating n't problems first , battery rather low , around 2 hours active usage secondly , charger short , annoying combination low battery lastly , biggest problem tends restart time time reason use longer periods time sound system amazing loads good speed , works fine besides problems
reasons buying purchased laptop homework \( college student \) well watch movies using external drive traveling fan tablets prefer typing papers keyboard windows operating system works well first impressions first laptop , small expected compact package , keyboard still easy type , buttons n't far classic laptop keyboard feel find , typing , turn touchpad resting hands seems move mouse mess \( easy fix \) touchpad responsive , left right clicking easy operate n't fight much like touch pads continued use happy battery life , even watching movies typing papers , use laptop day charge heat significantly like laptops \( assuming size \) quiet system typed 15 multi page essays laptop hands yet , 'd say great job design little space work overall would highly recommend laptop looking mobile work station , something view multimedia day small display makes difficult replace larger computer laptop , like would rather avoid pricey tablet , recommend bought , also came year long subscription microsoft office , absolute treat top machine
standard shipping 15 got 3 days great especially college student
handy little chromebook bought see could get device could perform work also play android games 's super light , long lasting battery , sturdy case bit light features auto backlit keys found pop keyboard tablet mode usually works fine house google apps covers bottom screen others unfortunate ca n't see typing 's nice access app store would n't picked otherwise however , microsoft office apps compatible device outlook , onedrive remote desktop ca n't get along \? google docs heaven download another app modify files inside dropbox lots want give shot !
nice , smooth operation like lot

contemplating laptop quite first always gone way desktops computer equipped , feel like got hell deal gaming n't much priority past , coding programming requires specs 2 8ghz quad core 16gb ram really makes things easy ssd makes boot eye fans barely make noise design great love red accents backlit keyboard 's cumbersome heavy fit laptop pocket backpack traveling knock i'm going give everyone complaining sound quality ! 's awful ! 're , crackle n't matter volume level always happens ! ! ! fix connected headphones expecting quality better still bad means 's speakers sound card drivers tried updating drivers since brand , update n't fix instead installed default windows drivers , issues sound even though play drivers fix sound , still consider solid buy bloatware comes , deleted works like dream !
great laptop great specs price good battery life average 7 8 hours high quality matte display minimal bezels \( slightly xps 13 \) really like setting allows users adjust brightness backlit keyboard
item delivered horrible condition , thus would make sense spend 40 new one
computer 15 days , far 's good computer love problems asked hp chat , helped download applications need remember place read usually new computers basics needed update programs better performance far working good need
best choice ! happy purchase
good device , everyone start , runs chrome os , obviously , first integration playstore current internet trouble connecting thats hard tell thats bad internet something device ran videos smooth looked amazing high resolution display , definitely offer media consumption device , near 500 look tried gaming android games part ran smooth without hiccups however touchscreen n't optimal lot resistance trying slide thumb , felt rough frankly uncomfortable typing keyboard felt good found typing speed time good travel nice curve typing documents essays thing would incredibly doable main reason got unit built stylus , samsung galaxy note user years , caught eye good size personally , medium sized hands , comfortable draw unfortunately drawing apps didnt palm rejection neither chromebook , would rest hand device would usually start drawing hand touched well otherwise good draw way get linux windows device unfortunately uses arm chipset , later year microsoft comes new arm windows full software , chrome os 'll get overall device nice , felt good hold hands crisp display secondary media consumption document writer makes sense looking something bit , look options fit budget , end day , limitations chrome os great keep everyday driver
super slow seemed issues brand new laptop maybe lemon like returned ordered acer cost little turned fantastic !
laptop works great however , came several scratches body purely cosmetic annoying
laptop friend weekend program needed project perfect handling basic tasks microsoft word , excel , powerpoint , web browsing , watching videos , running basic programs , etc much responsive 200 laptop previous generation celeron processor likely get dad
i'm simple perfect , computer perfect look tube videos , check e mails , college assignments 15 6 screen makes watching video great experience although , screen occasionally turns black lot tabs open , big issue , 's minor annoyance
laptop ample space download ever want still room spare machine great gaming well heavy loads gaming wise software came works well games overclocking came machine works well experienced crashes yet either , 10 10 would recommend others
thing given away thrown away poor condition stopped working first use pay ship back

's slow bad backup n't rely
main reasons needing chromebook tablet like device 1 \) easily checking working google files home working \) watching movies tv home items , 's 5 start device one star 1 \) buggy issues apps software assume work time instance , wifi drops \( occasionally \) instead chromebook , restart order find signal 2 \) speakers n't get loud i'm watching something kitchen use headphone hear kitchen used tablet loved , needed device easier email , 's settled chromebook like plus convertible , use like tablet working touch pad , use literally email entertainment keyboard take getting used , occasions work home send personal email , major complaints needs probably could gone cheaper device , i'm hoping plus last long time 's added features bonus

noticed slow laptop may seem , consider windows 10 big os compared earlier versions also hard drives slower solid state drives bad \? necessarily enough power game light video editing workstation gaming laptop costing 2 , 000 tech guys always iffy amd figure keep software date , works wonderful love purchase works eventually might add ssd expand 16 gb ram enough final verdict someone budget , perfect light gaming video editing better , either spend upgrades laptop , go something dedicated 24 7 heavy use thank lenovo amd impressed got update november 29 , 2017 laptop froze know windows 10 microsoft edge acting wonky download current amd software better cleaner temp files microsoft edge , one day browsing internet 1 hard drive space microsoft edge lesson learned , always clean pc moment gets slow looking , microsoft edge windows 10 power hungry hope windows 10 improves better near future

love chromebook ! except n't learned prepared powerwash , factory reset , chromebook every months always switching unstable , beta stable channels chrome os , requires powerwash time change channels may run random issue android app , system great part chromebook unlike windows pc automatically installs add ons , extensions android apps \( give system use google play store \) onto like , screen great colors , great viewing angles , sensitive touch usb c ! port rule ports , really excited like usb c port sides able charge device
looking computer handle data science demands found gaming beast gaming i'm tearing data 's beautiful lit keyboard awesome touch far exceeded expectations
pro works well great screen light weight google likely support least 5 years \( search google end live policy \) touch screen nice easily text con poor touch pad hdmi output \( buy adapter \) , backlit keyboard would nice keyboard bit small gets uncomfortably hot lap \( two chromebooks run cooler \) usb c connections , compatible usb connected devices \( adapters available \) conclusion less expensive chromebooks would better fit needs , however , nice machine might well worth extra price users carefully review requirements
great computer many ways proprietary charger instead usb c beyond stupid second charger cost 80
laptop really performs well price better option vs chromebooks similar price range also course runs full windows apps 've read negative reviews screen i'm guess must hd version \( \) full hd version \( 1920x1080 ie 1080p \) screen looks decent i'm happy performance m3 's also great looking machine , feels well made opinion , look feel reminds new macbook pros , fraction cost 2 gripes keyboard n't backlit , ca n't charge laptop via usb c , like asus chromebook , example , still prefer bigger screen \( 14 vs 12 5 inches \) purchased extra power adapter leave one home one work edit forgot mention flip tent tablet mode , course type right touch screen dark , regardless non backlit keyboard , also includes stylus want avoid fingerprints screen !
delivered ahead schedule kind , started , seems function expected , 'll another time immediate complaint computer ordered blue , said description , one purple guess read still issues colors first time 've ordered product wrong color going keep laptop , n't want go returning , n't see color lid open need teach colors yes , makes difference i'm afraid search elsewhere reliable source future large purchases thanks !

laptop buy lots spreadsheets , playing games memory work however , really good surfing internet , email simple tasks take lot horsepower screen ok \? great quality seen worse speakers ok \? bad , fine youtube picky sound keyboard comfortable feel like typing keyboard fast simple tasks , fine touchscreen would perfect mother law email online , surfing would plenty use last year bought laptop lots capability rarely uses \? would less expensive using acer kitchen checking email , online internet surfing \? works great concerned cup coffee expensive laptop
fairly disappointed got acer , least inexpensive model supposed 32 gb memory , almost \( 80 \) used system files preloaded things , leaving virtually memory play deleting every app computer allowed delete , ability download maybe one desired app downloaded 2 n't even enough free memory computer update waste money , 'll admit need laptop browse web never plan saving anything actual computer well , would possibly work hand , security updates road might find memory filled guess get pay , n't think sell computer basically unusable

lightweight ! two months love mouse trackpad , easily solved using plug
first , everything worked well upgraded regular windows 10 install software unlike previous windows version everything worked great 3 months issue face recognition sign , seemed work fifth time 's also monitor n't 360 degrees however , overall really liked laptop nice light , could fit purse really well however , 3 months , stopped working without reason physical damage laptop whatsoever , simply closed like normal one night , would n't boot 2 hours later monitor went black , keyboard would light working , worked great despite iffy face recognition sign touch screen sensitive enough , sleep reasonably well timed 've contacted microsoft support thankfully 1 year , however , means simply probably replace refurbished one 's bit lasted 3 months anything wiped hopefully , next laptop longer lasting overall , working shape , relatively 4 star complaints face sign , n't 360 degrees , magnetic charging often would fall
