I placed my order on December 19th and was under the impression it would arrive on the 22nd as this was going to be a gift. It finally arrived today,but unfortunately it is not what I expected. The front looks like it was sanded over as you can see in the HP logo, it has a rough texture throughout the laptop. The keyboard has a red tint all over more noticeable on the on-off key. There is a lot of uneven keys and scratching. The back is dirty and worned, well the entire laptop is. Needless to say I will be returning the item. I have purchased refurbished items in the past, but they have never looked this way. Please save yourself sometime and donât order from this seller.
I just received this laptop today and I'm returning it today. I've bought "certified refurbished" items before and had a good experience, but this was terrible. This laptop looked like it had been used by a child or teenager. It had magic marker spots all over the cover. The outer casing was filthy and chipped in multiple places. Overall it just looked terrible. Also, the model I received was not the model in the picture. None of the ports were the same as pictured and the color was completely different. This was clearly an older model, not the one pictured. Please don't make the same mistake I did, heed the warnings in the negative reviews. Amazon shipping was right on time and packaged nicely, as usual. Everything else about the product was not as advertised.
I knew I was purchasing a refurbished Chromebook, but the condition was horrible. The screen was separated from the computer. The back looked burned or damaged in a fire. It was dirty and serial numbers were scratched off. Overall, I would not purchase from this vendor again.
Right out of box it's fast, reliable, temperature stays cool, excellent battery life, does everything I need it to do with blinding speed. The heaviest processor use I do is skype or watching videos online, but it does all of these with ease. Great laptop for the price.
Received and returned same day. The serial number seemed to be scratched off because it left a groove mark and then stuck on with a sticker. It was dirty. Still had fingerprints on it. It croaked when I opened the screen because it had a crack in the corner. Multiple scrape marks. Not worth the money so I returned and purchased it new for just $58 more.
This refurbished product has some "bad actors" who are selling D-Grade and Dead on Arrival junk out there, and they do need identified and snuffed out. If folks start listing the seller that sold the Chromebook (Hint: it's NOT Amazon. This is a marketplace sale, it's somebody else.) then maybe they can lose sales and folks will be happier.So, here's a start: don't click on "Add to Cart", but instead click on "See all purchasing options" and pick a vendor other than the cheapest price. For example, the one I got from DIGJUNGLE. It's a good refurb. New screen, reconditioned battery, and the case is in great shape. It's not brand new quality, but NO REFURBISHED product really is. The case on this one has been cleaned very well, and still has some greased fingerprints and pen marks. But I expect that from a used device.It started right up and the Chrome logo was the first thing I saw. This device was "powerwashed" before shipped, so when it was turned on it was the 'New User Experience' asking for a Wi-Fi network and user account login. I checked all the ports for connection and they all worked. Headset jack is also in good shape. The file manager shows no files left on the device when checked. Photos included will back me up on these findings.In short, if you do get a bad machine, post an appropriate review. Please, let's kick the rocks out of here. And you do have my sympathies, the restock fee should not apply to a DOA device or something that looks like it was ran over or left at the bottom of a quarry for three years, but that's between the reseller and the customer, unfortunately. Amazon is a middle man, all they can do is impact the seller from doing business on here again, since it's tarnishing their brand every time this happens. (eBay is falling apart for the same tactics, unfortunately.)But the ones who do good work should keep on selling. If you get a good machine, list the seller in the review so folks who are doing their homework can pick them and skip the machines rescued from a dumpster fire. I had a good experience from DIGJUNGLE. You might have a good one from someone who isn't selling at the cheapest price (go $20-30 higher than the cheapest if you can). But it's still a dice roll.
If I could give 0 stars, I would! I donât mind buying refurbished items but I do expect them to come as described. My laptop came completely trashed. I havenât even turned it on to see if it works because it looks like absolute junk and it supposed to be a business computer at the front desk that everyone will see. Unbelievable. Do NOT PURCHASE!
I order quite a few refurbished electronics, and normally they are as good as new. When I received this laptop it was filthy, and had multiple chips missing out of the case like it had been dropped. The bottom had a chunk taken out of it, and was yellow in color. I didnât even attempt to turn it on before sending it back. I had a higher expectation of a product that the description included âcertified to look and work like newâ?
I am very disappointed in this product it is supposed to be Amazon certified the computer screen was falling off upon arrival there were dents and scratches on the back and the computer was filthy with dirt. This gets no stars in my book.
We ordered two computers for our daughters for Christmas and they were in terrible shape. Several visible damages. The back was even a different color on one of the computers. Cracks on the keyboard and one would not even close! This was definitely false advertisement!
I was going to give one star, but it does work. It looks like it was pulled out of a dumpster. Discolored (some kind of pink stuff) and the edges looked burned. I read the description which said it would look new.....not at all. It looks older than my laptop which is 6 years old. Disappointed as it was a birthday gift for my son.
This is my first Chronebook. It is lightweight, nice screen and really fast. Takes a check with the tutorial on how to access all the programs as they are not installed on the hard drive.but online It is easy to learn and I now prefer it; it got me through my college finals! I recommend this laptop to anyone who is considering buying a reconditioned laptops; it- looks and acts new. Arrived in Box on date specified.
Product arrived on time and seems to work. The product description is way off base their description states it will âlook and work like new, with limited to no signs of wear. This is totally not true it was Well used and color worn off around all the edges and wasnât even cleaned, it was filthy. Like my mechanic had just worked on my car then worked on the computer.I had to take a magic eracer to it to get it to look a little better as I was giving it as a gift to my son. Very disappointed with the look.
Ordered this laptop and it came in like this, brown border around the top and bottom, what looks like hair/fur in the hinge, and sticky all over, returned it immediately did not even check to see if it turned on
How can Amazon advertise such poor quality item as Prime? Folks, take a look at all the reviews. The Chromebook case is badly worn and has a dirty appearance but unfortunately you can't wash off the dirt as its rubbed in so deeply. Mine was also missing rubber feet. I think Amazon is just reselling the same set of Chromebooks that keeps getting returned.
This was my first time buying refurbished. I received it within the two day shipping. It looks brand new. Everything works fine. The tutorial was very helpful on start up. Battery life is excellent. Charging to full power is very fast. I really like it. The only draw back I found was chromebooks can not download java programs which is why I needed a laptop. But other than that this was a great purchase. I really love everything about this laptop. My experience ordering this was very good.
I had some reservations about buying a refurbished Chromebook, but I need not have worried. Everything works perfectly, and it is nearly indistinguishable from a new product with only a few light scratches on the HP logo. Very pleased to get a 14" screen and 3 USB ports for the price of a new 11.6" with 2 ports. I also appreciated the prompt 2 day delivery and thorough protective packaging. If you're considering saving some hard-earned cash buying refurbished, I highly recommend the seller.
If I could give this a 0 Stars I would it came in a Shabby box which was fine but then when I took the computer out the screen was detached from the casing there scratches and even almost like a divit carvrd into the back pictures attached.
First time trying Chromebook, takes a little to get use to. It is very fast starting up. Could not find a lot of apps that I like though.
"tested and certified to look and work like new"NOT TRUE. When you return it, you have to pay for shipping! And a 15% "restocking fee". This is the kind of scam usually reserved for Ebay. My laptop came with bite marks. I'm not kidding. See photo...
I purchased a refurbished chrome book and it arrived with a physically damaged screen. There are multiple scratches over a 4 inch area of the in the center of the screen. When powered on, a thin white line is present on the left side of the screen. Item is dirty, was not cleaned prior to shipping. Very disappointed.
I bought the HP 14" diagonal SVA BrightView HD Chromebook because I have a 11.6' samsung chromebook, which is too small. This chromebook has a larger screen and it works better than the 11.6' one. I only use it too surf online and using the terminal for coding. The larger screen enables me too protect my eyesignt. THe condition is fine. I would gicew it a 5 stars.
The laptop was MORE than used it was scratch all over , a key was missing from the keyboard. It looked like someone pulled it out of the trash. I was so disappointed and to make things worse it was a Christmas present. How dare you even try to sell something so defective. Appalling! I gave one start JUST because I had to !
The Chromebook arrived in a damaged, opened box with no paperwork or invoice. I ordered the Chromebook in Silver. Instead, I received a very dirty white colored computer. I understand I ordered a refurbished computer, but I expected it to be in the color I ordered and not filthy.
iâve purchased referbished items serval times & have had a great experience. Got this laptop as a surprise for someone & right out of the box had issues! laptop turned on but has a VERY faint, dim look to the screen. We could not see anything. we read the paper that came along with it & it said to charge at least 5hrs before use. so we plugged it up over night & still absolutely no change. weâve already scheduled our return. iâm HIGHLY disappointed in the quality of an item i paid a good amount for. certified referbished is an understatement here. i donât believe one bit that it had been tested or properly functioning prior to arrival at our home.
Very disappointed with the service and product quality. I received my order and the laptop was dirty, already turned on. And to make matters even better: The previous owner had not deleted her login information. First+last name. Picture and email address. So Iâm unable to even GET INTO THE COMPUTER. So how am I even suppose to use this???????!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely terrible refurbishment!!! It came filthy and covered in scratches/dents. Also did not turn on. Not sure how this even got certified but i would not suggest purchasing through them.
This item was in terrible condition was supposed to be white is dirt and in awful shape, very disappointed!!This was horrible!!! Was bought for Christmas gift!! Looks like it came out of dumpster!!
Just what I expected and wanted, a simple browser.
I didn't realize the difference between a laptop and a chromebook. Very disappointed In the chromebook. I feel that I wasted my money.
This was a GREAT product!! Especially for the price. I was just looking for something to get on the internet here and there, watch a couple videos and store a couple photos....this is perfect!!
It was beat up! And I had not researched what I was getting. Wanted a convert to touch screen also
If I could give it zero stars I would. I am returning the item. It came very dirty and overused. I understand it was a refurbished laptop but for the price it should look much cleaner. Very upset.
Not happy at all. The screen came off as I was opening the laptop. There were marks all over the screen that wouldn't wipe off. Had severe wear and tear marks all over the laptop as well as dirt on the bottom of the screen. The image shown is definitely not what I got.
I returned the Chromebook for a full refund because it was used not refurbished it was filthy and it it had numbers ground off of it.
this was for a friendit quit on hershe was told that it would cost $70 to repair
Garbage, refurb the worst I've ever seen. Returned 3 of them that were to be gifts.
Bought as a present and just found it never worked properly and is white screened. Also arrived filthy. Wish recipient would have told me sooner to return. Totally embarrassing.
Keeps shutting down for no reason. Am planning on returning.
I recently purchased this refurbished HP Chromebook and couldn't be happier. It arrived on schedule just as promised and looks and performs like new. You can't go wrong while saving hundreds of $$!!
I bought this chrome book for my daughter to do her homework. It is way better than I thought it would be. Super fast. Looks sleek. She loves it. Great product for a great price.
Great product so far. As an entrepreneur I'm always looking to save money yet invest in something that will help advance/increase my sales. Thanks HP for this perfect laptop.Also the sound is like having speakers in the house. Love it
i gave it as a gift so i have never used it..
This is honestly my favorite purchase. Donât really know what the rest of the complaints are about but everything on the computer was working and in very clean condition.
The description of this item was exactly what I received. I did see some of the horror stories online and was prepared for worst scenario, but this item surpassed my expectations. It might as well have been brand new. Does have minor quirks like keys sticking causing run on inputs. I am very happy with my purchase as a whole.
I bought it for my sister and she loves it. This is her first laptop. I wish it came in more colors.
This is used product. This fact should be up front in the description. My search filter was not set for used products.
Prompt delivery, everything was in order and exactly as advertised. Computer is easy to operate and extremely user friendly
I was happy with the product quality from this company. The computer I got was accurately described, and has performed very well, so far (bought it 3 weeks ago). Also felt that their customer service was good.
Great product, brought for middle schooler for homework, works perfect as he does all his homework online.
Not worth the price
Came in brand new in plastic with black clothe over the keyboard and plastic still on screen thought it be worse after reading the reviews above glad I waited to see it works perfectly fine and is a great laptop
Awful the item was badly damage
It's a good quality Chromebook for the price and i haven't had any problems with it.
You can see the past usage, my mouse pad stopped working briefly and now is working again. Other than that, I love my chromebook. Just wish I spent a little extra and bought a new one.
Refurbished laptop works excellently and if you can handle there being a couple of scratches that do not in any way impact the performance of the computer this is the perfect product!
Great Computer.
Love it love it love it love it love it love it love it I use it everyday I miss it now
The computer is pretty new to me. You can not tell it is a refurbo one. The configuration is good enough for daily use. And the price is incredible
Not a bad product for the pricing, runs fast, decent condition, set up like a cell phone, makea s it easier to operate
Purchased on January 11th and the product has burn mark in the back air vent as if a component burned out. What is the warranty?
Chrome book was delivered on 22 December as promised and in perfect working order. Recommend this vendor to anyone looking for similar items!
For a refurbished laptop it works wonderful! I love using it! I wish it was a little cheaper but I love it! It was shipped safe and in good condition
Total rip off. Item arrived like it was a 10 year old laptop and non working. Like something out of a pawn shop.
Very satisfied with this purchase. The machine works good, arrived on time and without issue. Would definitely use Blazing Prices again.
Got here in less than 2 days, and started right up. Excellent. Some cosmetic imperfections, but all in all great product!!
Arrive on time. Works great
item was delivered in horrible condition, thus it would make sense to spend $40 more for a new one.
A little more used than I expected and has a line across the screen.
fast chromebook , i'm really happy , but on this Chromebook you can't install google play!
Just received the HP Chromebook....I understand that it's a refurbished product, BUT for it to look as extremely used buy everyone in the world is very disappointing. I thought I was going to get a Chrome colored unit, but instead I received a dingy white one that's all scratched up and discolored! I didn't even want to turn it on! Once I turned it on, it seemed to work fine, but found out that it doesn't even have a "Caps Lock" button! Wow. Never again. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!
Very bad shape used. And locked to someone else account. I throw it away
Very impressed with the quality for such a low price.
Computer has worked great and is in excellent shape! Thank you!
it's filthy, doesn't work without charger, mouse doesn't work at all
It was not too expensive. Itâs fast and lightweight. Itâs prime!
Received with a broken screen
In great working order. Performs as advertised.
I've had it 3 days and I am pretty disappointed. I bought a new one of these at best buy on sale and I was looking for another one at a better. Next time I'll wait for it to go on sale again, this is not worth the minimal savings.This morning it wouldn't turn on. I looked up the issue using. You phone and found a solution. Got it to work... But for how long?This looks like it has been through a battle. Top part is much whiter than bottom/keyboard part. Deep, visible scratches above the power button and escape on keyboard. Some of the back seems to have white out on it. There are random ink stains in colors like purple, white and pink on the back. Looks really used.
I bought it for my husband when his PC died. What a great alternative to a laptop. It is like a large version of the IPad. . It is easy to use , sets up in minutes and a printer can be used with it. It will be my purchase when my PC dies . It is half the price of a new computer,. I have already recommended it to a friend..
This didnât work within a month and we sent it in and have heard nothing!
It's great, got for my daugther for Xmas and she loves it
Everything works its good
DOA, won't even turn on!
Great product, no problems at all, will gladly deal with again. Thank You
I bought two of these chromebooks for Christmas present our two teen kids. Both products arrived dirty with many stains on the cover and highly scratched keyboard surface. I spent hours trying unsuccessfully to clean both products. The advertising listing and picture suggested it was silver metal surface but it was a white plastic coating that has many reports of stains. The notebook function and screen are fine so far but we had to spend $20 each on a new cover. Requested help from seller but only obtained an automatic response. After days of no response to our questions and concerns we were forced to get the covers.
Happy so far with the actual computer, but not happy with the appearance of the refirb. I know it is 'used' but I assume that when I pay $200 for something, it would be shipped clean and not scuffed up..... This is a gift and it looks like it's been threw the ringer- screen lines, dingy. Not pleased with this.
My daughter has been continually using this chromebook for her daily need during the past ten days. It has most features and priorities: ports, stability, simple handling, and great performance. It is a fairly powerful chromebook system. Everything feels very sturdy with a weight less than 4 pounds. It is also very well equipped with ports of HDMI, LAN, USB3.0/2.0, HD camera, bluetooth, etc. The wireless signal quality is very good.The touch of the keyboard is smooth and solid. The touchpad surface is conveniently easy to operate. The chromebook is quite most of time.Overall, it is a solid Chromebook which can be a very good alternative to a laptop. Thought certified refurbished, it looks and performs brand new â?a great buy.
Product page states that the product is tested to look and a work like new. I ordered 5 of these computers for all 5 of my kids and every single computer came very rough looking, lines on the screens from the keyboard, finish scratched off, peeling and dirty. I haven't even charged or turned them on and I'm already disappointed and contemplating sending them back.
had to return it. It had screen scratch defect, and looked very worn. Also a screw was in the box from the bottom. requested a refund
Looks new and is . Letâs me down load apps to it and is great for school work and great price also
The notebook may work great, but Google's sudden shutdown of Supervised User parental controls 1/15/18 has left parents scrambling for 3rd party alternatives, not always successfully and certainly more work. Some parents have been returning their Chromebooks purchased over the holidays when the controls were still part of the Chromebook. You can look in the Google Chromebook-Central Help Forum for details on the service shutdown and a long list of angry parents.
Computers arrived damaged screens, burn marks, keyboards messed up. Refurbished my ass. Don't waste your time!
Hp was dirty I am ashamed to give it as a present ;( if she disapproves I will send it back didnât have time to try it out I hope it works I will post a pic tomorrow
Great product! Quick delivery.
RuInÃªs my childâs Christmas. It was all she wanted and it came BROKEN!
Fast and efficient
Exactly as promised. Very pleased.
arrived DOA
Useless thing. Doesnât have a Word or Excel. Everything I did on the computer gets deleted next morning. Memory of the laptopis tiny. Basically the only one thing you can use this laptop for is just for watching YouTube. So actually to me itâs not a real normal laptop. I can do more things with my iPhone than on this âcomputerâ? Thatâs why the price is so cheap probably... But free cheese is only in a mousetrap. So itâs better to pay $100 more but have a good usefull thing.
Very compact... Nice... Fast browsing... I love it so far... You can't go wrong.
Work really good, Is very light and good
Great laptop for the price. Very fast for what I use it for. Only downfall is that it doesnât have an internal dvd/cd drive. Does come with Norton security that I recommend immediately changing. Norton didnât load 6 or the first 12 times I turned the computer on. Since it is new and Windows updates regularly it will take several hours to update right out of the box.
I just got this today, but I pretty much tell right out of the box that this is going to do exactly what I need it to accomplish. First of all, I'm a freelance writer and photographer, so I will be heavily using Microsoft Office, GIMP, Grammarly, and Spotify. Here are my first impressions (I'll update this review as needed).Pros:I was able to load everything very quickly. It seems like the AMD9 processor is going to do the job well.I've had no problem multitasking thanks to the SSD and 8GB RAMIt's ultra lightweight, which is good because I already have a camera body and a few lenses in my backpack.The 14-inch 1080p screen is way better than the standard def 15.6-inch screen on my old laptop.The built-in SD drive saves me a USB port.Cons:There's no separate keypad on the keyboard, but that is to be expected on a very small laptop.Cortana is obnoxious during startupI had to get rid of a ton of preloaded stuff I didn't want.The video memory is shared (won't matter to me, but I wanted to mention this for gamers or video editors)Let's be honest, it can't match up to the desktop I built for myself specifically to run my business. That having been said, it's a simple and cost-effective way to keep running my business as I travel the world (which is the whole point of my business). I recommend this laptop for freelance writers and photographers, but the shared video RAM is a no-no for video editing or heavy gaming.
Got it for an acquittance. So far working great, a bit worried as an early adopter that it doesn't show up at ASUS official website. Upgrading (actually, replacing) from an Asus X54C from 2012 (6 years old, that I also recommended, same price point/bracket) that started to fail. The difference in speed/power is awesome. The power adapter is very tiny (I also have a thin Asus Zenbook with a compatible adapter that is about 150% the size of this one), even more compared to the power brick from before. The owner is hyper happy.Hopefully will last another 6+ years!
Itâs loud. Not sure why but all I hear is this thing thinking and the noise comes from the speakers on the top. Aside from this itâs built poorly. Be very careful with it itâs very lightweight and as a result I think itâs made from foam. It is pretty fast so if your willing to wear earplugs and never move with it, it should get done what you need it too.
First new laptop in years. Needed something for travel and when I don't want to sit at the desktop. Wanted to try solid state drive, not disappointed. Very fast startup. Don't see any delay running programs or video. Windows uses about 50G of your drive space. No problem with sound or noise. Light but not flimsy. About 6 hrs on battery. Runs cool, no hot spots that I've noticed. WIFI is just 2.4 -- no 5G. Even my very old laptop supported 5G - come on guys. This isn't really a problem though as most web page downloads aren't a factor of your WIFI, it's a factor of all the ads and how fast the sender is transmitting it. I have 70 mbps on my desktop and still wait for all the ads. Overall, quite happy. And for the price, very happy.
Shipping arrived earlier as expected, highly recommended, great Product, overall very much satisfied!!!
I received this laptop quickly on a Tuesday, by Friday I had to return it. After updating and setting everything up I kept getting an error message "application blocked from accessing graphics hardware" whenever I would try to watch a video, which then would crash the computer. I searched online to try to find a fix including uninstalling/reinstalling drivers and more to no avail. The Amazon product assistance said it was probably a hardware issue and issued a refund.
Laptop fan was very loud. Speakers produced a lot of static. Returned.
This computer is nice but the noise of the fan is incredibly loud. It was disturbing me so much that I had to return it.
ProsI have the 15.6 inch version. It is extremely light and has a beautiful high-resolution screen. I have not noticed any screen glare (as one reviewer mentioned); I guess it depends on where you place the light. It is very fast.Missing, but not too bad1. No CD/DVD drive. That was necessary to keep the weight down. One can always use an external drive.2. There is no USB 2 port. This probably wonât matter to most users, but when I try to install the driver for my 5.5-year-old HP LaserJet, it tells me that the printer cannot connect to a USB 3 port.ConsThe documentation is lacking some information. There are symbols on the function keys that I canât figure out, and the meanings are not included in the documentation.A method to boot from a USB flash drive is not described. I looked on line, and there is apparently a convoluted way to do it. I need this because I do regular image backups of my C drive to a USB drive. The backup software (ShadowProtect) makes a sector-by-sector backup of the entire C drive, including the operating system. If something goes wrong, I can restore the entire C drive to an earlier version. It even protects me from ransomware. To do a restore, I have to boot from a USB flash drive to a program that does the restore. My desktop has an ASUS motherboard. When I turn it on, if I press the DEL key, it takes me to the BIOS screen, where I can choose where to boot from. It would be nice if the LG offered such a simple method. I know this is of little interest to most users.
Having gone through multiple tablets and Macs, I settled on the LG gram 15" - it's been two days and the it's lived up to the hype after watching scores of YouTube videos and reading reviews both on Amazon and other review sites. The magnesium chassis has a good rugged feel and is cold to the touch.- Keyboard is pretty awesome, I've owned ThinkPads and other corporate laptops -- the LG gram keyboard is great to type on.- Precision trackpad means great support for Windows gestures- NVME slots means I'm not locked to 256GB forever and there is room for upgrades later- USB-C charging is great!
excellent performance
Pros:- Light- Compatible with linuxCons:- Awful screen glare- Off-center keyboard due to num pad keysOther thoughts:- Keys feel about right for a laptop (not too mushy)- Touchpad is OK- Texture makes the laptop feel like it was made out of cheap plastic---Compatible with LinuxJust about every device was recognized out of the box, with the pre-compiled kernel. Special modifications or external modules were unnecessary. My previous laptop was a 2013 Macbook Air. Suspend and resume work, ACPI lid events are sensible and not noisy (on the Macbook, I had them just turned off).---Awful screen glareI've almost always used my Macbook Air with a matte screen protector, but the difference is *glaring*. I don't understand why LG offered no options in the 2018 line up with a matte display. I think one of the reasons it feels even worse is because black reproduction is so good on the laptop. As a result, more of the glare is visible. Hopefully, a matte screen protector will solve this issue, though, I'm not able to find good ones at this time.It's a really good display that could be much improved with a matte screen.---Off-center keyboardThis is by no means a major flaw, but who even benefits from this. It's a unnecessary inconvenience. The experience would be better without those extra unnecessary keys.
By far the lightest laptop I owned. Super fast start-up. Extremely pleased with this one!
Honestly the form factor was really nice and thin and light but the computer itself was laggy
Could not get over the weird concave bend in the metal chassis the Keyboard sits in. LG told me this is normal but it looks like a defect in the assembly. I cannot tell for sure if it is defect or design, but I don't want to risk it.Not sure why the flat metal area around the keyboard and below the screen would need to be bent downward in such a way.(To describe it one way, it looked a little like what you would expect your laptop Keyboard to look like if someone sat on it.)The metal top should be flat front to back and not curved at the back of or behind the keyboard.Otherwise Very Nice Packaging & Nice looking Machine. If it wasn't for the weird curved area around the top for the keyboard it would have been a keeper.
Very light. Battery life is far off what they claim it to be. I had it set at 40% and was streaming about 5 1/2 hours over 2 days and it was down to 10%. Ordering a replacement and trying another. I'll leave an update.
This computer is amazingly light. Honestly I was shocked the first time I picked it up, it's that light. It's amazing that they can fit such a well performing large screened laptop and have it be this light. The screen is beautiful. Hardly any bezels too so it's pretty much all screen. The keyboard is nice and comfortable with a nice clickiness, not mushy like others. The trackpad is very responsive. Just as good as any other laptop I have used, including Macs. The specs are spot on for probably 90% of people. The 8th gen i5 is the brand new 2018 processor and it's fast! 8 gig of ram is more than enough for your average user. 256gb SSD hard drive is fast and a good size, I would say it's more than enough space for the normal casual user. Tons of ports including the most current usb-c. While I have not run any "tests" on the battery life it seems pretty insane. LG quotes 19 hours and I have been getting that and a little more even. It's nice to be able to not have "plug anxiety" and always have to worry about being near a plug for power. So far this laptop has powered through literally everything I have thrown at it. I installed Office 2016 and it handles excel, word, powerpoint, etc. with ease. I typically have a lot of tabs open while I'm browsing and it has never slowed down. I love watching Netflix on the large high def screen. Overall a super laptop for a great price that will meet the needs of 90% of users. Highly recommended!
First off, this thing is the lightest laptop I have ever owned or used.Let's start by the description:15.6" Full HD IPS LCD Screen. Very thin edges also.Windows 10 Home. Fair enough.72Wh Lithium Battery (up to 19 hours* - MobileMark 2014 Standard). Yes, that is about right. What I can guarantee is that I only keep it plugged just the time to recharge it to 100% and then it last me a good week of random use unplugged. I have set it up so it goes in sleep mode when not in use for more than 15mn unplugged and that it turn off the screen after 5mn.Intel 8th Generation i5-8250U CPU. Maybe but 1.6Ghz speed is fairly low.8GB RAM & 256GB SSD. One should add M2 SSD in fact.I installed a benchmark tool similar to the Win 4 performance tool and here is the score I got 7.3 out of 9.9The gaming graphics gets the max 9.9The processor and RAM get a solid 9.0 out of 9.9The Hard disk gets a 8.2 out of 9.9The downer is the dekptop graphic performance (Aero I guess) that gets 7.3 out of 9.9It is worth noting that the total score is defined by the lowest part.So what is it to like about it?- The weight. At 2.4 Lbs for a 15.6" Laptop, this is wonderful.- The battery life: For once a laptop that could allow me a full in-flight use while flying to Europe.- The screen quality: IPS screen. I have not seen the response time for gaming but IPS is usually fast- Modulable: I have already opened it to install another M2 SSD drive of 500GB. It was fairly plainless. I unscrewed the backplate (9 screws) and that was pretty much all it took.- Micro SD port.- 3 USB 3.0 ports- 1USB-C port- One HDMI port- One headphone Jack plug (not one for Mic and one for headset).- Very good sound output- Very nice quality of image- Silent. Even with the processor at 100% speed, the noise level remained very low)What I like less:- I have not found the second port for additional RAM. So one may need to replace the 8GB by 16GB. This may be costlyIn conclusion:I was previously using a 11" laptop to carry around and I decided to use this new one because it is lighter, more powerful and has a better battery life. No regrets at all.As for gaming, I usually use my very powerful desktop so I have not had the chance to really do gaming.For internet browsing, excel work and likes, this works very well.A solid 5 stars rating.Edit 05/07/18I have eventually replaced the SSD drive to a Samsung 950 Pro 256GB and added a WD Black 500GB as second drive. It is worth noting that both are M2 PCIe M Key and both did fit. The original HD was a M+B slot.You should be aware that one M2 port is PCIe Gen 3x2 and the other is a PCIe Gen 3x4. If you swap from M+B to M Key, the main driver is the empty slot. In clear, if you upgrade your drive, put the new drive into the empty slot, it will be the fastest.Now, the difference is not that dramatic but you will get the following:- About 2GB read/ 950MB write for the main drive.- About 1.8GB Read/ 800 MB write for the main drive.So now, my performance index for the HD has gone from 8.2 to 8.9...For reference, the original SSD was giving me about 55MB read/ 270 Write...What does it mean for an average user? Much faster boot speed and disk access in general. I have reused the original drive in a USB enclosure and I get very fast speeds for USB 3.0, it is now my fastest with speeds about 430MB read/ 210MB write...
This is a great laptop, it is functional for what I need for business. I didn't need something that was uber powerful. However working in the broadcast business as an engineer, the 4GB RAM is not enough for this machine. It is practically unusable due to the fact that it is extremely slow. I have over-clocked the processor, because it was only running at 600 MHz. It still ran way to slow, I'm pretty sure a tortoise passed me up. I will update this rating once I get some more RAM installed. I plan on running it at the full capacity of 16GB RAM. Time will tell.
This is painfully slow doing ANYTHING.It wa salso only 249, so I canât be that upset. I strictly use it for eritnkng papers on the go, but be warned, the speed is exceptionally slow.
Gift for my daughters birthday! She loves it and was in need of a new laptop!
CAN you play fortnite?
I debated with myself over the screen size; how small a screen could I live with? I also wanted it to be as light as possible. I opted for a larger screen, but I find that it's heavier than I wanted for my carry-around laptop so I could leave my bigger and very expensive MacBook Pro at home. In hindsight, I think I could live with a smaller screen, perhaps 12".I also debated about the RAM and disk size. Disk size is actually far less important on a ChromeBook than it is on a Mac or PC. All your stuff is in the cloud. It only stores what you're working on at the moment on disk. You don't even have to copy files up/down. It does that in the background as you work with the Chrome apps like spreadsheets and documents. You don't even have to look at how much space is available on disk. I opted for 4GB RAM rather than 2GB, because the unit was still around $200. That's an unbelievable price compared to any Mac or PC.What I love about this ChromeBook is:- It sleeps and wakes instantly- Multiple people can log into their own accounts (with a Gmail login). I don't ever let anyone "borrow" my login.- Battery power seems to be infinite. As I use it, it lasts all day between charges.- It integrated with my Android phone so I don't have to type my password when I wake it. If the phone is connected on bluetooth and unlocked, you can just click your login photo. (This is optional.)- There's no system administration, no virus software needed.- Any work that I do on my Mac (or PC) are instantly available on the ChromeBook. No copying files to a USB, emailing to myself, or wondering where the latest version was. It's just there.- It's very secure. It's secure enough that I won't worry if it's lost or stolen. Everything is in the Google cloud. Nothing is stored on the device that can be recovered by a thief.For me, it's the perfect second/travel laptop. I still have my power user MacBook Pro for video and photo editing. This will do simple things like cropping photos, but it's not meant for heavy duty tasks. For 90% of people, this will do everything one needs.One note for Windows users is the one thing you'll have to learn is that everything is easier and simpler. It feels more like a smartphone with a big screen and full-size keyboard, exactly what I wanted.
I set this laptop up with Gallium OS booting off a flash drive and it's working perfectly. Running through the USB port the operating system is *almost* as snappy as the native Chrome OS. There very occasional moments of lag that last 5-8 seconds but I think it's still faster than a laptop using HDD. Gallium is made for Chromebook hardware, between that and the SSD it's fast. I'm using the machine as secondary web development laptop and have Visual Studio Code, MySQL Workbench, Koala, Filezilla, GIT, NPM installed and over 100 gigs to spare on the partitioned USB 3 flash drive. After getting setup I've actually gotten a lot of work accomplished on thing. I've had no need to dual boot into Chrome OS since installing Gallium.I prefer this style of plastic Chromebook laptop shell over the aluminum 14-15 inch Chromebooks. I read the Lenovo N42 was designed to hold up while being used by students in public schools. If I take half as good care of the laptop as I would have when I was 16 years old there should be no issues.The monitor mount to the laptop body is is solid and doesn't wiggle. For some reason the display seems always either slightly too dark or too bright but never quite just right. Functionally the screen is more than adequate.The keys feel good when I press them and don't feel like they're going to break off or get pushed in. One of the aluminum Chromebooks I was looking at had sleeker keys and a seemingly more refined key press experience, but I don't like that as much as the punchy plastic keys on the N42.The battery life is not as good as I expected but much better than other not-Chromebook laptops I have. It seems comparable to the battery life of a Macbook Pro I used to have. I've got a Samsung 11 inch Chromebook that has amazing battery life, but I don't like using it because the screen is too small. This 14 inch N42 is a good balance between acceptable screen size and reasonable battery life.The ports are awesome, USB 3.0 is meeting my expectations. In terms of speed my flash drives seem to work as fast as any hardware drives installed in machine. Easily good enough for my purposes.After using this laptop for a few weeks with Gallium OS installed I really can't imagine the MacBook Air/MacBook Pro would be that much better considering the cost of both machines. I can't really do heavy graphics manipulation or processing but I never need to so for me that's not an issue. 13 inch screens on a Macbook Pro or Air for $1000+ is a little too small for my taste, 15 inch Macbooks are $2000+ so they are out, 12 inch Macbook screen for $1000+ no way. My point is, with this Chromebook I can functionally do all the things a Macbook does, but for $1000 less and I still get an elegant OS. I feel for my graphic designer friends who have to spend money to get good screens, but I can get away with this awesome little laptop for under $300 dollars.It's probably important to note without having installed Gallium OS I wouldn't be as excited about this laptop. Gallium wasn't exactly easy to install so if this sounds interesting, do a little research on what it would take before blindly purchasing to make sure your computer skills are up for the task. There are plenty of instructions online.
so good so far
Love this laptop!!
love it.
Great little laptop for the price. I bought this to replace an older, aging Asus ROG laptop and I absolutely love using it! It starts up fast, plays all my games great, and is nearly half the weight of my old gaming laptop! The fingerprint scanner works every time and is a much appreciated addition to the computer. The keyboard deck is a firm aluminum, which makes typing and using the laptop in normal use feel very premium, despite the rest of the chassis being made of plastic, though the plastic certainly does not feel cheap. The computer has a very professional look to it with a hint of that gamer charm in the red accents and keyboard. I personally find it to be a very tasteful and minimalist design, as opposed to the more flashy gaming laptops on the market, though others may disagree.The screen is great for most uses, however it can seem a bit washed out in some areas and when it goes black you can see some backlight bleed around the camera. Other than that, it works just fine for everyday use and gaming, and I don't have any issues with viewing angles. Speaking of angles, however, the screen does not bend back very far. For use on a desk or table this won't be too much of an issue, but on your lap or propped up against your knees while laying down in bed, this can present some awkward viewing positions where you're looking above the screen, rather than directly at it. I don't have a huge issue with this, but others might.The keyboard feels very tactile and easy to type on. Keystrokes are smooth and consistent and the WASD keys have a nice outline to them, further accenting the gaming aspects of this laptop. The keys seem to have a bit of a hollow, plasticky feel to them, but this does not detract from the experience unless you're the nitpicky type. I have not had any issues using this keyboard thus far.The trackpad could be better, but it's not horrible. I was a little spoiled to the higher end trackpad of my ROG with the smooth glass feel, so coming to the textured plastic feel of this Inspiron is different. Precision is rather good and gestures work with no issues.As far as sound is concerned the computer is silent during light use, such as web browsing and even watching YouTube. When I played Metal Gear Solid V, the fans kicked in but were not that loud or distracting. However, jumping over to PUBG, the fans went into overdrive, presumably because that game is much more processing intensive. You'll want to invest in a good set of headphones if you don't like to hear fans mixed in with your game sound.Speaking of sound, the internal speakers are good for the price point. They are not the best and a better set of external speakers or a good set of headphones will be much better. The internal speakers, even maxed out, seem a little quiet. For normal use they'll get the job done, but you'll probably want headphones of your own.The GeForce GTX1060 6GB packed into this machine has played whatever game I throw at it, from Fallout 4 to PUBG, at a consistent 60 frames per second. Even on battery the laptop can handle gaming, if at lower graphics settings and for a rather short 1 hour of playtime. Like any gaming laptop, you'll want to keep this one plugged in to play. Battery life, otherwise, has been hovering around 4-5 hours before needing a charge, a marked improvement for me over my ROG, which could barely hold 2 hours before dying.TL;DR: You're not going to find another laptop at this price point that delivers what this one does. I paid $899 for mine, the other laptop I was looking at was the Acer Predator Helios 300, which packs a more powerful processor but does not have the SSD and HDD included, only the SSD. I would have had to pay another $50-60 for an additional HDD, along with the $1000 price tag of the Helios. This Dell saved me nearly $200 and delivers all the performance I need without needing to buy more stuff along with it. If you're looking for a gaming laptop that won't break the bank while delivering excellent performance, this is the one to get.
We are a gaming family. Every one of us plays video games. When my son needed a laptop for a very conservative college, I started looking for one that had to meed the following criteria.At least an i5 to handle the new wave of games that require 4 cores.At least an high 9-family NVidia GPU to handle the gamesAt least 1 T HD to hold the games and all the class workSome version of an SDD for guick booting in classIt can't be covered in red/flashing lights/HUGE logos - it needs to blend in with all the other boring college laptops for non-gamersThis Laptop met all the criteria and even exceeded the GPU requirement - thereby future-proofing if until he's in grad school. Moreover, it did that in a package that has an excellent keyboard, great screen rez and it blends in with the other mundane laptops. Too many gaming laptops look like they were designed with 13 year old boys in mind. Lots of red. Lots of lights. They scream "I AM A GAMING LAPTOP...LOOK AT ME!!" Instead of sending him to college with one of those, I opted to get him something that he can open in any class and get zero notice. (The only "gaming" thing about it - aside from the specs - is that the keyboard is backlit red. It will stay red because it literally can not be changed. And that's fine as a red keyboard is easy on the eyes in a darkened dorm room where the room-mate might be sleeping.)My son has loaded his games on it, including some very demanding FPS's and it handles all of them without any problem (very respectable FPS). There are cheaper laptops to be had, but none of them have this level of performance. I would have expected to pay another $400 for a laptop with these specs. Some of the higher-priced ones might have an i7...but I build gaming PCs and know that - unless someone is playing a game while also running a half-dozen computing intensive programs in the background - there's not much to be gained from them.I tested some of the aforementioned cheaper laptops with the 960M GPUs and they run today's games well. My concern is a few years down the road. The GPU in this buys us a few more years of use. Take a look at this if you are looking for a sub-1k gaming laptop.
Fast overall, good graphics performance. Upgraded the memory and replaced the HDD with a SSD, one screw to remove and the bottom comes off. The memory and hard drive are easily accessible, the replacements took about 15 minutes to install. Overall, very satisfied with this machine. By the way, the 128GB SSD is a SK Hynix M.2, I may replace that eventually, I've only had it for about ten days.Okay review update time. I still love this machine, it's a little slow on battery but holds a charge well when using the Intel graphics adapter. I highly recommend the purchase, you won't be disappointed.
Love it. Screen is great, boots fast. Despite being advertised with 8Gb of RAM, mine came with 16. The NVidia 1060 plays the most demanding games with great fps rates. No flickr, no lag. The wireless card is excellent. I have Spectrum 100Mb internet, and there is very little dropoff from ethernet to wifi. I consistenly acheive 100Mb on wifi, and about 110-115 on ethernet. The wifi connection is rock solid, which may be due in part to the Motorola MG 7315 Wifi Modem I have. So far, this machine has performed flawlessly for me. The build quality is excellent. For the price, I don't believe you can find a more well-configured machine.
Excellent Valuepros:-pretty much what everyone is saying, amazing performance for the priceno brainer to buy this instead of building a mid-high range gaming rig due to volatile graphics card market. Buying a desktop GTX 1060 6GB will cost you about 60% of the cost of this laptop.- Max-Q technology. This makes the 1060 about 15-20% slower than the full sized desktop version but it only uses 60 watts. NEVER overheats.- m.2 boot- does not look like a gaming laptop, can bring it to workcons:- display is too dim and doesn't have the best color accuracy for IPS- don't waste your time buying the option with the 5400rpm storage drive like i did, it's just far too slow- keyboard isn't greatFINAL THOUGHTS:I know the i5 version is cheapest, and I have to admit it performs very well. I can't help but think I am a little foolish for not shelling out the very small extra amount for the i7 16GB version.
First off, this laptop surpassed my expectations, playing almost every game on the highest settings. And even being able to play VR Games with ease.It's a beautiful machine, and when combined with a fan cooler that goes below the laptop (the fans blow downward), it stays cool. I wouldn't try off-battery gaming, since the laptop will use the Intell Graphics card rather than the GTX to save battery life.As a standard laptop, it's slightly larger than some, but will last for about four hours without battery (using it for four hours straight).There is no trade off here, other than the CPU having no fans for cooling. It's an amazing laptop, and I highly recommend it.
Overall a great gaming laptop for people who can not afford to spend a lot of money on high end gaming machines. There are many good things about this laptop. It is powerful enough to handle pretty much anything that I throw at with ease. The speakers are solid enough to get the job done but don't expect anything that will blow you away. So far I have not had any issues with overheating while playing games. Although I do have few minor cons for this laptop, the power and the build quality definitely make it a worth while purchase. One issue I have with the laptop is the screen. It is not the worst screen you will ever see by far but it is just mediocre. Second, the laptop is a bit heavy but it is understandable given all the power you are getting. Lastly, battery life could be better at around 5 hours of light usage. If the battery life and screen were better, it would basically be the perfect laptop.
Had it in top-notch condition, running smoothly and plays all the games I throw at it. Its a Really good bang for your buck. But the color acuracy is not the best if you intend to do video editing
For the specs you get at the price given, its a steal. It handles games VERY well, but only when plugged in (which is understandable to a degree). The only problem I have is that it is super slow when on battery at times. I get that it would not be as fast while playing games on the battery, but just surfing the internet or watching videos, I can notice it slowing down quite a bit more than it should. Its not unbearable, but it is noticiable, enough that it is slightly irritating at times.Even with that slight issue, it is well worth it. If you plan to use this while plugged in 100% (or majority of the time while using it), you will have no issue, and if you don't, you will see it be slower than it can be (though if you plan to get a gaming computer and can't keep it plugged in while playing, you're going to have issues with ANY laptop).
I bought this to have a mobile gaming PC. It is perfect for that! I play Destiny 2 on it all the time and the experience is almost identical to my desktop pc which also has a GTX1060 in it. Since the internal display will only do 60hz anything over a GTX1060 is wasted on most games. I have no problem running current games on this at high or ultra settings. This laptop is also very easy to open up and upgrade. I replaced the 1TB HDD with a 512GB SSD with very little effort. The build quality from Dell is excellent and this could easily be a desktop replacement for most people. It is a bit big and heavy, so I wouldn't recommend this as something you drag to the coffee shop or use on a flight. But for LAN parties or gaming while traveling, it's great.
I got this during a lightning deal which dropped the price to around 932 USD including tax. It's definitely cheaper than the 999$ starting price on the Dell website but I have seen it go lower with discounts and coupons.Build quality is solid all around (keyboard deck is metal, everywhere else is good quality plastic) and the cooling system is awesome. The fans literally don't turn on when you're just browsing the internet. Fan noise is decent during heavy load.My unit came with Sandisk X400 128gb M.2 (not NVMe) and 4GB x 2 sticks of Hynix DDR4-2400 RAM (which I kinda hated since I hoped it would come with a single 8GB stick). It would've been better if they sold the 256GB SSD model here as well.
Great laptop for the price, loaded up and rating to go in about an hour or so after all the updates. Played overwatch on ultra settings with not much sacrifice on the Performance. Didnât come with much bloatware too. Like the finish of the chassis.
When I first received this PC it was amazing it was the best bang for you buck PC I could find. It ran all my games max settings and around 60fps. Mind you I treat this PC like a God and have a nice cooling stand and it never moves from my desk. All I do is game and leave my Desktop to my regular computer needs. Ive had this PC for 3 months now and I cant play any demanding games without the CPU maxing out to 100% and causing major shuddering. This did not happen at first but now games like GTA5 have a 60% GPU usage and 100% CPU. Usually the bottleneck is the GPU but for some reason its the CPU on this PC. I have the task manger out any there is no other application hoggign the CPU its just the games causing this to happen.TLDR; CPU major bottleneck always 100% usage
I live in Hong Kong and this model is very expensive, so I bought it from Amazon. The international shipment by DHL is fast and safe, which I am very appreciated for it. This is my first time buying a laptop from international shipment, I am very satisfied for it. At first I always expect there would be some damage for the machine while shipping, obviously it is not. I have used the laptop almost 1 week, so far every things works normal and smooth, the experience while using the laptop is great. I use it for a little gaming, internet, and typing this comment in Amazon. The keyboard is great, the cooling system is powerful enough for the machine, sometimes a little bit too loud but not a big deal for me, the IPS panel is already good enough for my need. I have already replaced my desktop from it, just feel satisfied for what I have bought.
Rather disappointed with this device. Plays some games on high settings with only occasional frame drops (provided that it doesn't get too hot). However, compared to the Macbook Pro (2012) that I used to use for gaming (yes, really), this thing is a piece of crap.- Pathetic CPU performance. Want to listen to music on Spotify or Youtube while gaming? Forget it. Having open any other program other than your game will fix the CPU at 100%.- Real-time audio is garbage due to buffer underruns from other drivers. If you do manage to play music (or any sound for that matter), it will be occasionally punctuated by ear-piercing pops and clicks.- Unreliable internet; default web browser is IE, and boy does it suck. However, Chrome (which I switched to soon after purchasing) is only marginally faster for some reason. I find it better to use another computer if I want stable web browsing.-Battery cord disconnects easily due to its weight. Just a minor annoyance.These problems are new to me after switching from my old mac, and it makes me wonder why I didn't just invest in a better laptop.If you are considering purchasing a satisfactory gaming laptop, I strongly urge you to consider spending a few hundred more on a better device that will be worth your patience. Good luck.
Pros:1. Runs games fine - a couple of frame drops every now and then but mostly everything is smooth. That 1060 Max-Q GPU will handle most current titles on playable settings but don't expect to max out your settings on the newest AAA titles.2. I've also used it to edit some short <10min videos and it handles that without much of a hiccup either.3. I've seen a few complaints about the screen but for my purposes, I've found it quite clear.4. Battery life is decent when not plugged in. I haven't tested how long it will last but i've used it for web browsing and YouTube unplugged and 3 hours later it still had around 50% battery life. I suspect it will get 6+ hours on light to moderate use.Cons:1. It's a little big and heavy so lugging it around for a long time isn't ideal.2. The keyboard isn't the best. But I use a Lenovo T-series for work so it might be a bad point of comparison.3. The bezelsaround the screen are around 2cm all around (close to an inch).All in all I can't fault it. Considering the price, this is a great laptop - possibly the best value for money at it's price point!
The laptop has great color and viewing angles for this price imo. I have a Dell U2410 (true IPS monitor), calibrated with a spyder 3 pro. With that said I am saying the laptop has a good screen for the money. The colors are fine, the RGB is fine, its all great for the price of the laptop imo. The keyboard is not a mechanical mx cherry switched keyboard, but its a not bad, I don't have any complaints personally with it.Ran a heaven benchmark on Extreme Preset and got a score of 1728, nothing overclocked. Played CS:GO, and Far Cry Primal, everything ran and played great.
I haven't had this laptop very long but I love it. Handles games with ease and it's super fast. I don't understand what some people are saying about the fan being loud, my laptop is pretty quite and so far has only gotten warm - not hot, but that's an easy fix if it did. Battery life is great for normal use but I leave it plugged in for heavier use so cannot comment on how long it goes for gaming. All in all I think this is a GREAT little laptop. If you're expecting a tower pc you might be disappointed but no laptop compares to one. Good buy and I'm very happy with it.
Everything is amazing. Handles GTA V ultra settings with around 70 fps typically. Great gaming laptop, 10/10, Ive seen laptops with these same specs go for thousands of dollars.
Originally I was going to buy a MSI GL62M laptop. But as I was waiting for that laptop to ship, I saw this one instead for the around the same price. This laptop included a stronger GPU and around the same performance in the other areas of the laptop. I was looking for a laptop with strong hardware for work, but also to use for leisure gaming activity and this hit the sweet spot.PROS:-1060 6GB-7th gen i5-Works for gaming but still has a professional look to it-Fingerprint scanner (which isn't mentioned in the description)-Great trackpadCons:-Though the description says 8gb of RAM, I wish it specified 2x 4GB of RAM because I ordered another 8gb stick to try to upgrade the laptop to 16gb. But now I can't add my additional 8gb stick because both slots on the laptop are taken by 4gb sticks of RAM. It is pretty frustrating.
The computer is great for the price, here's my list of pros and cons, as a medical student/gamer it might help others.PROS:-Great for gaming-Battery life considering it's a gaming laptop is great.-Fast-Quiet (both the cooling and keyboard are extremely quiet)-Red backlit keyboard (when studying late at night, the ultra white can bother the eyes, these ones don't)-Lightweight for a gaming laptopCONS:-Screen is definitely not the best-Sound isn't loud enough for me, but it has good definitionAll in all, I knew what i was buying so this never bothered me. The battery charger is a little big for my taste, but everything will fit in a big backpack. I don't think the weight is going to be much of an issue, it's not for me and i'm always on the go.For the price, I would definitely recommend this laptop. (would've loved dedicated buttons on the mouse pad but, it's not a concern for me.)
Bought the i5 version of this laptop (w/ 1060Max-Q) for use in Singapore (hot place with ambient temps of 30C). The laptop performs extremely well in games. I get 100+ FPS in Overwatch Ultra settings with vsync off. Doom in vulkan gives over 100 fps too. With prime95, the CPU temps peak at about 81C. GPU seldom exceeds 65C under load. The laptop is also very well designed for upgraders. I threw in 16GB of 2400MHz Samsung RAM I had lying around, and swapped in a 512MB SANDISK M2 drive. Overall, very pleased with the product.
Personally, I had problems with another notebook from this manufacturer in the past, they behave as "too-big-to-care-to-customers", their online service is especially awful for a tech manufacturer. But all that said, this notebook is excellent, beautiful design, fancy-looking, with an impressive combination of a 7th gen i5 CPU and the awesome GTX 1060 VGA. Decent gaming notebook without those flashy edges, red lights, and silly "annihilator" names. Fingers crossed to never need their customer support again...
This is a great laptop that cna handle most AAA titles at high - max settings. Now no, it is not compared to a 8700K 2x 1080ti in SLI becuase it is a laptop. A laptop that is above all the competition for its price.Recommendations-Upgrade to 16gb of ram (do it yourself so it can be cheaper!)-Either play with Vsync on or get a Gsync external monitior because screen tearing makes this laptop (or any laptop) an unpleasant experience
So, bought this in late February of 2018, by 4/17/18. Directional button like other reviews, was/is broken. Completely disappointing, Dell has dropped their standards apparently.
Out of the box it works perfectly. Great performance for the price, I'd even say this is the best bang-for-your-buck gaming laptop in the market, however, by no means this machine feels cheap. While it doesn't posses RGB, or a 144 hz monitor, it's solidly constructed and feels premium though and through.My only slight annoyance is that the fan can be quite loud at times, but that's not enough to make me deduce a star. I thoroughly recommend this laptop.
The ones I liked the most:-Excellent temperatures compared to your competition GPU ~ 65 Â° C CPU ~ 72 Â° C playing The Witcher 3 without a ventilated base or anything.-Relation Price / Quality very good-And good battery life ~ 5 hours browsing / something from YouTubeI did not like:-Mark of the screen VERY THICC-Weight of the team ~ 2.7kg- You could have a fan control software like Acer has in its Predator line
I haven't had a laptop in a few years and the one I did have was literally the first iteration of Mac laptops. A black choking dinosaur that bit the dust as it should. I'm still getting used to this guy, but so far it's very awesome.Easy to work, fun to use, big ass screen, and I can finally game a bit.
Excellent Thermals, Excellent Graphics, performed on par with my Alienware R15 1070 but actually ran cooler. Only con is that it requires constant power to actually play games at decent framerates, which is understandable considering the 1060 is almost on par with the desktop variant but it defeats the purpose of a portable gaming laptop. Sleek design does collect finger prints rather easily, and theyâre very hard to get rid of. Screen looks great with deep blacks and good colors. Either backlight bleeding or ips glow is a minor issue with this laptop but still annoying to the average perfectionist. And a touch sensor is a very nice addition. If youâre sold on a gaming laptop this is the best one for the price in my opinion.
This laptop ship all the way from California to Manila. I got this package last Wednesday, December 20. My first impression on this laptop -- you can spot screen bleeding near the camera. Too bad, I can't easily ship it back for replacement. I guess, I have to live with it.Overall I like the build of the laptop.
Great choice for my first gaming laptop. Crisp clean resolution and audio and this might be my excitement clouding me but i think my internet even runs faster on it.. Amazing battery life when not gaming (about 6 hours while i was downloading stuff) And while i game with my charger plugged in, even without it the battery life is pleasant. Its fast and powerful for my most played games like PUBG and EFT which are moderatly demanding games. LED lit keyboard makes typing at night effortlessly and the brightness of the computer can be turned down. A great all rounder laptop with more than enough bang for the buck.
laptop is great. I love it. performance is amazing for this price. I totally recommend it to everyonepros:great specsgreat performancecooling is amazingSSD is really fastbattery is pretty goodcons:not the best screen(color accuracy isn't best and I wish it had more brightness)not the best speakersit has 2X4GB ram, would be better if it had 1X8gbwindows 10 home is... it gives me errors on many games. I googled it and everyone says it's because some dll files are missing. I never had that problem on my other laptop,it has windows 10 pro
I hadn't owned a laptop in more than 10 years. I'm a desktop PC person. One of the most important parts of my job is monitoring the shifts in the land under 50+ year old bridges in the Appalachian Mountains. As we've repaired them, the need for someone to be closer to be able to go physically test the land and check them has increased. I live just within 100 miles of all the bridges I monitor but those close to 100 miles away can't just be checked instantly. I go to a hotel about 10 minutes from a cluster of 6 bridges and stay one day and night per week. Guess who tried to take their desktop PC? Yep. I should say I have other interests and uses for the computer too. I am used to being in a house with my mom, my wife, two kids and two puppies. It's lonely at a distant hotel, so I needed something to play my video games on while monitoring. I didn't do as much studying and researching as I normally would on a purchase like this. I have a fairly good grasp and knowledge of computer parts and what I need and don't need.The screen was important but not a deal-breaker since the hotel is a Courtyard and has HDMI televisions that I could connect to. The screen is very nice and I could only see the most stringent of display snobs having a problem with it. I mean no offense to display snobs. I'm an audiophile, I'm a sound snob, we've all got our obsessions. Speaking of the sound, it's okay, nothing more, nothing less. I have a Bose Soundlink Revolve and take it with me, it connects easily to the laptop's bluetooth.When I bought this there seemed to be some questions about the specs, so I've made a short list of the ones I was most interested in:It has the Nvidia GeForce 1060 6GB video card, it plays everything I play very smoothly. I'll go more into that below.It has bluetooth as mentioned above, and AC WiFi, both work very good.The battery life is good for me but I never have it unplugged for more than an hour to two hours. I guess I could have tested that but I rarely think about unplugging it.The keyboard is so nice that I actually use it instead of plugging a USB keyboard in but I did buy the Logitech smaller wireless keyboard (Logitech MK360) and mouse set just to be safe. Trackpad works well too but I prefer a mouse. Don't hold that against the laptop. I've used a laptop maybe 1 year total in my life and have used a desktop PC for more than 20. I'm just not that used to the trackpad. The keyboard and trackpad are backlit with a red color, it's non-offensive and non-glaring and helps a lot if you like to use it in the dark.It has a Solid State Drive that had around 80 GB of free space upon booting it the first time. It's used for your Windows which gives you a fast bootup. It also has a Hard Disc Drive that has 920 GB of free space upon booting it the first time. It takes less than 10 seconds for me to go from pushing the power button, signing in to being on the desktop. That's very comparable to my high-end desktop PC.There's an HDMI 2.0a, a USB-C Thunderbolt and three more 3.1 USB (those work with the older USB versions, if wondering).It has 8 GB of RAM, it can be upgraded to 32 GB and is very simple to upgrade if you need more RAM.This laptop either met every need I had or surpassed the amount I needed. The video card is a bonus to me. I don't play the newest games and usually prefer console versions. I will say I can play Morrowind with graphics overhaul with no problem on this laptop. I also can play Fallout 4 on it with no problems. And what I've been mainly doing is using it to play games through PS Now, it runs those perfectly. I don't get any of the noise, I'm guessing I'm not pushing the card that hard but will say it's very comparable to my PC at home that has a GeForce 980 GTX in it. And I'm again guessing that's because these games I play aren't very stressful on the GPU. The 980 GTX is rated quite a bit better in benchmark tests but take it from me, unless you're playing the very newest games on ultra settings, you're not going to notice. I spent 3 months buying that PC with the 980 GTX and can say I don't think I've ever come close to using all the power it has.Which makes this a great "work" computer! I do use a few programs for work that this laptop handles easily. I'll also mention that there wasn't much bloatware on it. And by the way, Cortana is not disabled when you first setup the laptop so be aware. I plugged it in and turned it on, went to the bathroom, came out and heard someone talking. It was Cortana. I'm also one of the people who really likes Windows 10 and it works well on this laptop.I can't find a single fault with it. Unless I wanted to complain about the sound but what do you expect from a laptop? I would normally say whether it's overpowered for some people or underpowered for others but I think those looking at it are probably like me and thinking about some gaming use. I will upgrade the RAM eventually, probably in summer but it's really not needed yet. All in all, I think for the price, the video card, the good dual hard drive format, it's about as good as you can ask for.Look at that, I forgot to mention it doesn't have a disc/optical drive. I really planned it that way since I didn't even notice it until a few weeks of using it. That might be a downside to some, so make note of that. I have a USB disc drive if I need to use a disc but haven't in at least a year. And guess I should mention that it's well-built, might be a hair heavy for some. My daughter used it one day and said it felt like a triple version of her laptop. Dell did a nice job with this laptop.
It is able to run games that require gtx 1060 6gb pretty smoothly. The one thing that ticks me off is that it gives me a white screen with lines when i open it 30% of the time. Its an easy fix by just holding down the power button and turning it on again. Other than that its a fast boi!
everything gone well during importing to Turkey, but laptop itself too loud when u r playing any game... And one ot the direction button (down) was broken! and not working well
I bought it when it was on sale for about $897 so that made it even more worth it. Laptop fans get pretty loud during gaming so headphones are an absolute must. I've only played a few games so far (PUBG, Overwatch, Civ 6) but they've all been able to run at high-ultra with no problems. Fan noise is mostly non-existent during normal use (web browsing, creating office documents, etc). Laptop fans keep the system pretty at a good core temp during gaming. Overall fantastic laptop.
Great value for the money.
I was so surprised at the premium quality build of this machine. For the price, it's an absolute steal as it can totally chew up any newly released games on the market. I can use this laptop on high settings for Battlefield 1 and keep a few cool, controlled FPS of around 50-60 - even during hectic moments. The fan runs a little loud, but generally with good headphones you can drown it out during gaming sessions.The IPS panel is also really comfortable to watch with a subtle matte finish and decent color gamut. The Chassis is aluminium and although the laptop is quite heavy, it feels extremely well built and durable. It also comes with a nice back-lit red keyboard, thunderbolt and both a 128GB SSD and a 1 TB HDD. The keyboard is quite comfy for typing, but the keystrokes seem a little short for long typing sessions (at least my preference anyway).For any serious, or recreational gamer with a taste for high quality games, this laptop will perform really well especially if you're on a budget! This is exceptional value for the hardware!
Excellent performance for the money, power consumption and heat is much lower than asus vivo book with 1050. Great bios.
Simply its so powerful and provides great performance with games at ultra for example GTA V, Cod WWII, Fortnite and The Division.The laptopn is always cool and at low tempreatue even at high load (playing games). The only problem is that its so loud but thats not a big deal as its a laptop and the fans produce loud sound to keep the device cool.Finally i would really suggest anyone buying this.
ideal pc gamer I can play lol, wow and others without any problem as well as edit photos and videos and for a very good price
so far this product is 2 weeks old when it arrived, i am still testing it to see how far it goes. battery is kinda okay. still figuring the laptop out. i'd advice anyone who want to buy this product upgrade to 256GB SSD at least with GTX 1050 Ti.
Great laptop for the price. It shipped and was here quick. Ordered for my wife for college and it plays anything I throw at it on med. to high settings.
So far its been a great laptop. Wife pretty much set it up and got her games going without much help and the games (ESO and FO4) look & play great. Good budget gaming laptop.Edit: Taking a star due to bad specs in the listing, we love it and it works great with our high demand games, but it doesn't have the same ports listed which is causing some issues until we get a splitter/hub. Its short at least one USB port and I think one other type, but I'm going to check it against the listing again when I get home tonight to see what else.
great only wish the screen took up more space but looks great so good purchase for the price
One of the best laptops I have used in my life. Although, it has frozen two times so far(not something major, just a few secs, it's some bug I guess). My recommendation is that, as soon as you get it, you should update the divers and the BIOS If possible, to avoid some performance troubles.
Good buy for my 12 year old, sturdy.
the computer is excellent and I love the only thing that sometimes bothers a little is that the keys have to be pressed a little hard and sometimes the screen is pasted when you connect a device or you open something but not in the game sessions is excellent only those two small details but super recommended
The best solution for your money. Excellent features like a fingerprint scanner, thunderbolt 3 and keyboard backlighting, and 128 GB SSD. Most games are played at high settings of 40-60 fps. Under the load noise, but at the same low temperatures, 60-65 Â°C processor and video card. Good battery life. I recommend to buy.
So far so good. Does everything I ask if it with ease. Display isn't stellar but I knew that initially.
Great laptop.
For a 900 laptop this is great. It's fast and responsive. The screen isn't amazing but isn't horrible. They had to cut corners somewhere to offer a GTX 1060 laptop for 900. I have to knock off a star for two points though. It's a little too big. It's a 15 inch screen in a 17 inch laptop body. Keep that in mind when buying bags or laptop covers. You'll need one for a 17 inch laptop due to the size of the device.The second issue is Dells support assistant. This is one of the most horrible pieces of software and uninstalling it did not uninstall it. It basically tries to check the major systems of your computer whenever you reboot it or turn it on. The problem is it gives off false alerts. It thinks my fans are not working even though they are. Everytime it fails checking the fan it makes this horrible, loud sound. What's worse is because windows constantly updates my laptop will reboot every once in a while. This cause my laptop start screeching in the middle of the night. Once I find out how to remove this horrible program this will be an amazing mid range laptop.
Im loving so it far, i can play the same games my other buddies with there High end PCs can. Al though, im having heating ussies, this is probably a really isolated case since im the only one in the reviews thats having this problem. So yeah, some bad luck for me.
One of the best budget gaming laptop. It can run any AAA game on high setting and it didn't make any loud noise and overheat for a long gaming session. The only downside is the bottom left of the laptop is a bit pointy and I always bump my arm when gaming.
Awesome laptop!! I was a little skeptical of it only coming with 8gbs of RAM but it ran PUBG (on guest wifi) without the power supply perfectly!! Would definitely recommend!!
As advertised by seller. For the laptop itself, I would highly recommend the 4k display if you can afford it. Otherwise, this is a pretty good gaming rig for the pricepoint. Very good cooling, Consistent performance.
The computer is great when its working but this is the 4th time this has crashed on me. I do heavy video editing and the specs should be able to support it but for some reason keeps crashing
Great, amazing, and fast laptop for the price. Just got it and loving it so far, will update it in about a month or so.
Great for gaming. But the display is disappointing.
fast and cool design but the speaker is not that great
Good price, Good laptop, Good performance
This computer was good for the price. And I would recommend waiting till the price goes to 800-900 area.This computer can run any intense game With ease but might need more ram.
For the Price you cant beat this Machine! Max-Q Laptops are usually at least $1600, this model does it for less. Even at 100% load on GPU/CPU temps never passed 60. Machine is very quiet. The cooling is very efficient. The machine is stealth black with red accents thatYou don't pay the i7 tax. For Hyper Threading and .2ghz in Turbo Mode. Not worth paying $200 for 10% improvement is certain programs. Save that money and get more RAM.Build Quality is Premium. Just from holding it you can tell its a High End Machine.
Runs as it should, keeps really cool for a gaming pc. I recommend reinstalling the operating system first before using.
At first i was sceptical what a 900$ gaming machine can do..after purchased, dell actually did it..it fast and can play all triple a games..im at indonesia and it deserve 5 star..
Very powerful and a good substitute for a desktop.
I have had some problems with my device among which are the heat produced which is much higher than I expected because in some reviews mentioned that I had a good thermal solution, the problem is that by playing about two hours the device gives a few pulls and you can not continue with the games session, another issue is that my device brings two 4GB RAM memories and usually usually comes with only one of 8GB leaving a slot free and then add another if necessary but in my case I must buy two if I need 16gb of ram, the network card on the other hand is quite slower than I expected since I have the same card in another device and it gives me quite good speed however with this barely and it helps me web browsing, I tried to reinstall the drivers that previously had updated but has not had any effect, otherwise everything is fine and I guess the defects that have i machine does not have to occur in other devices of the same series however it is a point to take into account since they can not launch equipment with these defects without a previous revision of them.
I mean it is a very great laptop that is why i purchased it
Loved everything about this machine. Apart from the heating up above the keyboard (don't know if all laptops do that or not) 7577 met all my expectations
Value for money. I really like it. The price of the product and service no other laptop can match.
Amazing gaming laptop! Iâm in love
You're getting a GTX 1060 6GB for under $1000 (not sure if the price is applicable as of this review).
Did my research, picked this model, happy with my purchase.
its a 1060 6gb in the description, but what u actually get is a 1060 maxq
Died after 2 months. Can't be repaired as I lived outside of the US.
i love it, fast.
So impressed with the build. Kudos DELL ðð½
All ok expect just battery timing
Love this Laptop
My son loves his new computer.
Amazing laptop
I love this laptop so much!! Considering the fact that I was using a hp probook 4540s, this is quite the upgrade for me.The laptop has a very good design and finishing to it. The red backlit keyboard is so cool and loving and it gives a hint on the gaming side of it.The keyboard is sturdy and sweet to type on. The speakers are great also.Then, the powerhouse of the laptop is the GTX 1060 MAX-Q design. I have tested it so far with Rise of the tomb raider, FIFA 18, Ghost Recon wildlands, far cry 3 and they all ran at 60 fps and above on high settings. Although the fans get a bit loud when playing games but that shouldn't faze you if you're really into the game or better still, get a pair of headset.The fingerprint reader is a sweet and fast addition to the laptop incorporated in the power button.In summary, the laptop is a really good one for the price tag and I'm loving every single bit of it
Best gaming laptop at less the $1,000. Really like this because it has plenty of storage, gtx 1060 gpu plus a thunderbolt 3 port. Will have the possibility to use external gpu in the future if I want to.
Loving it!
Very good
This laptop named "Gaming Laptop" its totally lie. When you press more than 3 keys it can not percieve the 4th. I couldnt play lots of games because of this poor keyboard. Also screen is so bad and there is same problem like other customers. There is white side when the screen is black . Its located under webcam. It is totally waste of money.
This laptop is decent for its price. There are some cons of it thoUPDATED REVIEW.The worst con of this laptop (could be any laptop using 2 GPUs) is the issue with Optimus technology when switching from Intel GPU to Nvidia GPU. It cause freezing the OS, locking and lagging the mouse. it is very annoying and frustrating when you try to use laptop for work and gaming.1. The keyboard is bad. Very soft and you dont feel the feedback makes its so hard when typing and gaming.2. The weight. Its bit too heavy compare to other similar type of laptop. Makes it hard to carry it around to work.3. The anti glare screen is not too good. And there are some white screen bleeding at the corners.4. Experience some freezes of system when using usb mouse and plug in and out use devices.5. I tested the ssd drive and the speed was very slow. You can feel it when running apps and games.This review was given after I installed latest windows 10 updates and drivers, bios.Will update more for this review when I test it more
Very pleased with this purchase, I got it mostly for my wife to work on her spreadsheets and scheduling for work remotely that being said it runs silently while doing that and the battery life is pretty good.I myself am a gamer and wanted something to be able to play games when away from my desktop we brought it on a trip and I was surprisingly able to play far cry 5 on ultra settings at 1080p while keeping a stable frame rate of 40 to 55 FPS which for a laptop with an i5 and a 1060 max q was awesome though the only downside is. that you have to keep it plugged in and the fans can be a bit noisy but I play with headphones so it wasnât a bother at all I would recommend this laptop to anyone at this price point.
Better than expected..
First gaming laptop I bought ever, first laptop in like 10 years. Did I need one? Nope, but I wanted something I can use when I'm away from my desktop gaming pc.Specs wise, it's not bad, a gtx 1060 MAX-Q with 6gb of vram, that alone is something to consider as I looked around there isn't anything at this price point with this gpu power. Most laptops in this price bracket either run a 1050 with a slightly higher or same cpu or older 9 series gpu. The ram is garbage, 8gb isn't enough with win10 and gaming nowadays, and it's using 2 slots, would be better if it was 1 stick of 8gb so you could get another 8 stick. CPU power is probably on the weaker side with any of the top end games if you want to run past medium settings but for casual gaming it's usable.The build quality is for me, solid. Though I have slight bleeding on the screen, I don't notice it during normal usage, and there's some warping on the build that kinda bothers me but doesn't hinder function. No dead pixels for me. I don't have a problem with the keyboard, it's a laptop keyboard and I can always plug in my keyboard from my pc.The minor gripes I have with this comp is the way intel gpu and nvidia gpu is used, disabling intel gpu entirely makes the comp running really unstable, and when it's not plugged in to an outlet I feel like the nvidia gpu doesn't kick in in games. I haven't tinkered with the settings enough to figure out when and how it transitions but destiny 2 runs, overwatch runs, so I have no idea how I feel about it.This is a budget gaming laptop, keyword being budget, so it can be quirky but it's a fantastic deal imo and with the gpu market still taking a hit from cryptocurrency, getting a prebuilt pc or laptop seems a lot better than paying 900+ for a gtx 1080....It runs Nioh, Witcher 3, FFXV at medium settings, the specs sits at minium requirement, upgrading the ram, and possibly adding/replacing the ssd with a bigger one would improve overall performance and storage (the 5400rpm hdd is meh). I will get to it in the near future atm it works fine for what I need.
My first Windows pc in a long time. I have Apple computers and needed this to run QuickBooks Premiere. Wish it had a disk drive,
Screen absolutely is not good.Viewing angles, color accuracy or brightness.
Awesome Laptop. loving it
Not what I was expecting from a "gaming laptop". Cant even run Dota 2 at max settings, everything has to be toned down.
First let me be clear why this Laptop gets 4 stars. The lid with the red Dell Logo is a fingerprint magnet! Nay! A hand print magnet! Other than that, the GTX 1060 with 6GB of vRAM and 7th Gen i5 does a really good job running my wife's 2D scroller cooking game....Pros:GTX 1060 6GB vRAM for all those delicious frames.The screen is surprisingly beautiful. I was almost convinced it wasn't 1920x1080 until I looked at the specs inside Windows.The laptop is VERY sturdy. Has a nice feel to it.Something I didn't know it had was a fingerprint scanner on the power button.Above average sound quality.Khans:Grease magnet lid.Isn't an ASUS.Features the GTX 1060 MAXQ design which increases battery performance and cooling at the cost of GPU rendering power. It's honestly not a bad thing, the difference in framerate from what I've seen in YouTube videos is no more than 10 FPS at most.
Great Machine!
Fast shipment, well packt. Very nice computer! I am very happy with this product
for the price this is great value!
GOOD LAPTOP.
I bought it about 2-3 weeks ago and I honestly cant find any thing wrong with the laptop great build quality, great specs. maybe the battery is not that great (only 5 hours of browsing and streaming videos ) but overall great gaming experience for the price :)
This is a nice machine. My only issue is that the display casing is weak. I feel I need to be extra careful when opening the laptop. Besides that though I love it. Plays my games well and doesn't look gaudy like so many other gaming laptops. If you are looking for game performance Gamer_Chris23 has done a bunch of videos on youtube.
Nice gaming laptop.Very very heavy .Came on time and in good packing.Still configuring it .Will update the post and tell more about pros and cons next week.
Laptop is sold , just wish it had windows 10 pro instead of home
This has to be one of the best laptops on the market and it's under $1,000. It hasPros:â?15.6" form factorâ?Fits inside your average backpackâ?Light weight, you can carry this around for hoursâ?No compromises on parts (high performance Intel Core i5 7300HQ and desktop grade GTX 1060)â?Room for a lot of expandability (up to 64GB of RAM, has an M.2 slot and 2.5" drive bay)â?Sleek and neutral design, not flashy nor aggressiveâ?Solid battery life (mine lasts up to 5 hours on light work loads -- internet browsing and coding)â?Can handle heavy duty work loads (gaming on ultra settings, great for video editing, 3D rendering)â?Solid I/O options (has Thunderbolt!)â?Temperatures don't get high (mine sits at about high-60's, low-70's under full load)â?Great display panel (IPS, 60hz provides amazing color and consisten viewing angles)â?Body/keyboard is sturdy and has zero flexâ?Keys aren't mushy which provide a great typing experience, compounded by the solid foundation of the body makes it very close to typing on an actual keyboardâ?Keys are backlit with red LEDsCons:â?Fans ramp up under load, even when temps aren't bad
Great price but defective product..does not work properly with some games.
The laptop is great, but all the storage i have availible to me is 64GB. Is anyone else having this problem?
I'm writing this review since the reviews I have read in the past did not cover what I wanted to know about this laptop. Ill be comparing this to an older laptop that I got from frys rocking a 960m and a 6th gen i5.BuildOld laptop was also a 15.6 inch IPS display but the RGB percentage was much higher to being the same quality i have on my desktop, This dell has an ips display but I think its somewhere around 50% rgb so colors do look washed out but not as bad as a TN panel.Despite being a 15 inch laptop it is not wider but about an inch longer than my old laptop, some users described problems using sleeves with this. It is also heavier so it is a little cumbersome to carry around.The trackpad on this is very very good, I enjoy it and can actually do productivity work without the need of a mouse which is great, the touchpad on my older laptop was garbage. The keyboard on this is passible, keys feel thin and flimsy and I cant type as fast as id like to and I have issues gaming on it on first person shooters whenever I need to crouch jump and move forward (ctrl+w+space)SpecsIt has a 7300hq which seems to be able to handle whatever I want to throw at it and got me a browser spedometer test of 130.1060 with max q. It has the ability to max out any game i have tried on it so far with good framerates but if I do the fans kick on really loud and depending on the game the section above the f10-f11 keys can get really hot to touch.If you play off battery it will limit itself to 30fps on any game and run reasonable cool and quiet.Games Ive tested were really demanding games like Nier Automata and Rust. both at 1080 and no issues at 60fps+Battery:My old laptop would get 2-3 hours of non gaming use off battery and 30 mins If i launched any game, be it older games from the xbox360 era like ff13 or modern games. Basically cant use it unplugged.Dell on the other hand. was able to run 8-10 hours of non gaming use depending on brightness (40%-60%) (100% brightness got me about 6 hours) which is really good for a gaming laptop. Also another thing to note is that if you are just browsing youtube or typing up stuff the fans wont kick in and the laptop will be passively cooled so there will be no noise to bother others if you are in a library setting.Gaming off battery would get me a little less than 3 hours for older games like FF13. and 90 minutes for more demanding modern games like nier and rust so its possible to have a quick gaming session on the go when there is no plug to be found.Bottom lineIf you want to buy this laptop I recommend you buy it from costco because it is currently $750 right now, add in 8 gigs of ram and add in a 1TB drive (should cost you about an extra 100 for both) and now you are looking at a fully loaded laptop for $850.If you are going to game on this plugged I also recommend to download the geforce experience drivers and set whisper mode so that your laptop wont try to kill itself giving you 100+ fps at the expense of getting scalding hot and sounding like a jet engine taking off. Whisper mode reduces the work the gpu will do and give you a locked 60 fps on shooters and 40fps on other games but your laptop will run cooler and quieter.
Awesome build quality with nice sleek plastic and aluminum materialsInsane gaming performance ( gtx 1060 max q, i5 7300, 8gb RAM etc...) for the price especiallyThe best cooling you can probably get with max q 1060 laptops out thereSilent when running meager tasks such as browsing youtube, watching streams using it for anything other than video gamesSSD reads pretty wellDesign is more accessible compared to most other gaming laptopsCons:Fans can get loud when playing games but not really an issue when you use headphones etc...A bit heavier than I expected for a maxq laptop but not a huge issueThere are better sales on the dell website although they are periodic and not scheduled so pay attention
it is ok, the screen is little uncomfortable
If you plan on playing demanding games, I recommend using some good quality headphones. Fans will often kick in soon after launching a game, and will stay on 5-10 minutes after stopping. Iâve looked online to try and find a way to cut back on the fan speed, as they often donât need to spin as fast as they do (the thermals are great on this device) but it appears that Dell designed this machine to always have the fans spin relatively quickly when playing games. Aside from this minor issue, the laptop is a great purchase, perfect for anyone looking for a reliable, well built machine. You wonât be disappointed!
It has a very good video card. But it doesn't have dvd rom and vga port. The empty unused space on the left and right of the screen is also not so nice. Touch pad not so smooth.
Great build quality but very poor battery life. If you're looking to get this model go with the i7 version.
The screen is awful, worst than my 300 dollar latop screen. Why all the specs if the screen is limited? The computer freezes often, just seems sluggish. Now that i bought it and used it, doubt i can return for my money back. Anyways now its sitting in my closet.
Its ok. Plays games great but the images are a little distorted when you are moving your mouse too much. Overall I recommend getting a pc if you are planning on strictly playing games!
I got this laptop because it matches the Microsoft spec for Windows Mixed Reality Ultra. With its GTX 1060 discrete GPU, it does that job just fine, but ONLY WHEN PLUGGED IN.This laptop is completely unusable for 3D gaming while on battery. Something is throttling GPU speed to be REALLY SLOW when you don't have AC power. For one scene (part of the Heaven benchmark on Steam), I get 70 fps on AC and only 12 fps on battery.I worked with both Dell and NVIDIA online support to find and disable all the power-saving settings I could, and nothing made a difference. Maybe there is an additional setting somewhere that the support people could not find, I don't know. But nothing we did fixed the slow GPU speed while on battery.
When you purchase this laptop, allow yourself a full day to set it up. First you will need about 3 hours to charge the battery, then Windows updates will take a couple of hours. Then it will take some time to get rid of the junk that all new computers come with (I'm not a gamer, so lots of games had to go). If you are a Windows 10 pro, then you should be good to go. The last Windows computer I had was XP, so Win 10 took a while to get used to. I won't trade my Mac for anything, but I was at the point where I needed a new laptop to take on appointments with clients, and since they are all PC users it only made sense to go with a Windows machine.The computer isn't really gold at all, but more of a silvery color. I was worried that it would be flashy and "in your face" gold, but it is very subtle.The caps lock button doesn't let you know it is on, and that can get annoying when you accidentally hit it. There is also no separate numerical keypad, but maybe that is normal for laptops. I am more of a desktop user.Fingerprint technology is great, although about half the time it doesn't recognize me the first time and I have to do it again. Still, much faster than typing a password. Startup is super fast, literally only a few seconds. I was initially only looking for a $400 or so laptop since this won't get much use, but I am glad I splurged and got something with a much better processor and a SSD for the operating system.This laptop weighs next to nothing, and the screen is about the thickness of a few pieces of cardstock. Really, it's very impressive. I am still on my first battery charge, and have probably gotten 5-6 hours out of it, but it is warning me now that it is low.The only downside so far is no DVD drive. But I picked up an external Asus Zen Drive (SDRW-08U7M-U) for $29 and it works great. I don't need it often, but my iMac doesn't have a drive either, so now I am all set for both computers since it is plug and play.Overall, I'm very impressed and glad that I chose this model out of the 40+ I looked at on amazon before deciding. I was worried that it wouldn't have enough RAM, and apparently your warranty is void if you put more in. But so far it is very adequate. If, after trying to run Photoshop and a bunch of other programs all at once it seems to be lagging, then I will update my review.
This is a punchy little laptop for its price that pleasantly surprised me in a lot of ways, and disappointed me in others. Part of my amazement with some of it probably has to do with the fact that my everyday workhorse laptop is a couple of years old, now. It certainly feels outdated next to this thing! I'll start with the good.* The laptop is REALLY light. When the box came, my husband didn't believe there could really be a laptop inside. He thought I was joking when I told him that's what it was. Weight doesn't honestly matter to me that much because I don't tote my laptop around, but if weight's an issue for you -- I really can't imagine laptops getting much lighter than this.* It turns on fast. Really fast. It has the OS on a solid state drive, and then a terabyte drive for storage, and the advantage to this is that solid state drives boot up super fast. This is a laptop that I'd have less of a problem with shutting down regularly, because turning it back on again takes about the same amount of time as it takes my laptop to come out of sleep mode. It's that fast.* It packs a fair amount of power without the heat. I've tested it on both Overwatch and Minecraft, and while it won't do either of those games at their best graphics settings (or even near-best), it does run them, and runs them smoothly. Moreover, it does so without producing a lot of heat, which surprised me. I have ordered a fancy chill pad to go with this laptop, since I anticipate it's going to be doing a lot of playing games with high graphics requirements, but I'm not seeing a lot of heat issues, even without it.* I thought the whole 'thin bezel' thing was silly until I saw this laptop's screen. It really does make my old laptop's screen seem outdated and clunky.* The speakers are decent, for what they are. They don't have much of a bass, but they did bring out some things in the other registers of the music I was listening to that impressed me. If you just want 'thump, thump, thump', they're not the speakers for you, But they might hold up okay, for music that has a little more than that going on.* Battery life was pretty decent. My roommate played Overwatch for hours on it and didn't realize that it wasn't plugged in.Now the bad:* This is the biggest concern I have with this laptop: The charger gets REALLY hot, and the wire itself seems flimsy. Between the hot charger and the flimsy wire, I'm expecting that my charger isn't going to last long. This isn't something I'm terribly comfortable leaving plugged in and walking away, either.* It comes with a lot of bloatware which you then have to go through and uninstall, which is kindof a pain. I don't get why companies do this. Also, it tries to push McAfee on you. I don't know why companies do this, either.* The speakers, while decent, could be better. But I've been saying that about my laptops for years, and have yet to own one where they ARE better. Still, when my iPhone has better sound, it feels like there's room for improvement.* Given how light and thin it is, I'd actually be a little afraid to tote this thing around too much without some kind of really protective case. It seems like it could get damaged too easily.
The laptop is a good value for what it provides. But, the screen and sound though fair are a little underwhelming. My older ASUS NV53V has much brighter screen and it sounds a lot better than this one.Everything else is top notch.----Update 7/19/2017I have used this laptop for a month now. To be fair, the display and sound are both as one would expect other laptops in the price bracket. In the era of rating inflation, I will up my rating to full 5 stars.
I've had this laptop for a few months and I love it a lot. It boots up in seconds and makes it so easy to get on task faster. I take it with me to school and its light enough that I don't feel like I'm carrying bricks. The battery lasts for 7 hrs and I usually dont charge it for two days bc I mostly use it for school work and only play one game on Steam. I don't really use it for heavy software, so I don't know how powerful it is for that.My main problem, though, is that sometimes the mousepad will stop working for a minute or two, or it will lag, but with my wireless mouse it's fine. It never lags or stops working. With the mousepad, I will try to right click but it will act like I intended to left click. It's frustrating, since I dont take my wireless mouse with me everywhere.Overall, I'm happy with it.
As reviewed: i5-8520U, 8GB DDR4 RAM and 1TB FireCuda Hybrid DriveI am very happy with this little laptop. Now I'm a person who can't stand the current trend towards tablets and touchscreens. I'm an engineering student and have a powerful desktop setup with two 21:9 monitors and regularly use both when I'm doing homework. I'm bothered by little details and expect higher performance than the average user. I needed a laptop to bring to my internship and carry with me to classes so I started looking for a small laptop with decent specs. For me this laptop matched everything I needed at a reasonable price.The main selling points for me were:-Small portable size-1080p ips screen-Decent cpu-Traditional layout-Subjectively a nice lookOnce I got my hands on it I had some thoughts on it. I was pleasantly surprised by how rigid the chassis feels despite being plastic. When I first started using it I wasn't sure I'd like the track pad, but in use I haven't noticed it at all, it's functioned exactly how I want it to. I consider the keyboard to be good, I'd prefer a more clicky experience but I can't fault anything about it. I feel fast and accurate typing on it. I installed Linux Mint on it and it runs perfectly without tweaking. The only feature that doesn't work on Mint is the fingerprint scanner. The hybrid drive is tolerable, not as quick as an SSD but I'm not bothered by it. The speakers have a decent sound for a laptop, albeit a higher max volume would be nice.In conclusion this laptop offered everything I wanted at a reasonable price. The functionality is on par with more premium offerings and it still maintains a solid build quality and good looks. If you're looking for a traditional laptop in this size I feel comfortable recommending it. I plan on updating this review if anything happens as time goes on to change my opinion of it.
This item was delivered on August 7th, 2017.As advertised this laptop is extremely light, and also very fast.I discounted a few stars because:- The colors are weird. Sometimes they look dull and other times they are just simply wrong. Tried using Intel HD Graphics Control Panel to match the settings with those of an older ASUS laptop but they seemed to be the same already.*After some Windows update, the colors are better but there's still a faint yellowish tint. Haven't tried BIOS reset yet.-The box it was delivered in alongside with an external CD reader was too big and with little to no protection. The order was handled by amazon, thought.Side note:- The plug is on the power brick, which might be inconvenient in some situations.- The audio is very nice, but the location of the speakers makes it so that they may get covered when typing.- NO CAPS LOCK LIGHT OR ALERT.
Replacing an 8 year old 17" Acer I ordered two different Acers only to return them both. This ASUS is GREAT. I love the configuration. Its Elegant, fast as hell and excellent choice for home computing. I use a MacBook Air at work and it has nothing on my new ASUS. Thanks to Amazon Prime and their return policy I've got the the perfect laptop for my needs.
Great laptop, the only thing that sucks is the battery life. The Wi-fi is super fast and connect's to router's far away, it boots up and shuts down in seconds. It is so fast!! Everything is so seemless on this computer. It has everything I could have ask for, with fair price tag. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who doesn't care about bringing their charger with them. I also suggest you buy a screen protector for this computer, it gets fingerprints on it so easily, it not one of those displays that has a plastic cover over it like touchscreen's.The display is very nice and has a HDR like feel to it, the color depth is great, very HD. I would recommend you buy a case or skin for this laptop, Amazon seller's sell a nice kit that comes with a skin and screen protector for 20$!! Overall good laptop so far.....
I spent a good amount of time searching for a decent laptop. I was stuck between a Mac and an ASUS, I ended up going with this laptop...obviously.I was looking for a laptop with a lot of memory, I'm becoming a coder so I needed plenty of space for my applications and programs. This laptop has it's pros and cons, just like anything else does. I'll start with pros: the look of it is very nice and sleek I must say, space, of course, is a big plus to me, I really just love ASUS as a whole honestly. Cons: the battery life isn't as spectacular as I would think it would be, the speakers are not that great, although I stream it through my tv so that doesn't really matter too much. Sometimes, it will randomly freeze, not too long but long enough.Overall I will say it's a good computer and I'm pleased with it. So depending on what you are looking for in terms of use, I would suggest this one if it would suit your needs.
I bought this laptop to decommission a Dall unit from 2012 which served me very well, also being a 15.6 inch. It was pretty difficult trying to find an all around good laptop that fit all my criteria but this one mostly does it all.Build - 80% of the body is a light sturdy plastic. The cover on the screen lid is a metal sheet that makes the lid pretty sturdy. I like the weight of it and it doesn't seem flimsy at all. It looks great and premium has a good selection of ports and a full size SD slot.Screen - I came from a 768p laptop which was the worst, so jumping to 1080p is an irreversible step I've taken. It's very vivid and colors aren't too saturated. The brightness is on the low side and would be nice if it could get about 20% brighter and it is a matte finish and gives very decent angles.Battery - My laptop is usually a desk queen, but I have tested the battery and it's decent. Light use would see about 6 hours of life and hard use would be closer to ~2 hours. The battery time estimate is erratic and sometimes seems inaccurate.Keyboard & Touchpad - So I was expecting to have to relearn a new keyboard but I guess since the main body is only slightly smaller than my last laptop so it's almost basically all the same spacing and everything. There is no function key lock which I seemed to take for granted previously but it's not a big deal. This keyboard is backlit and has 3 different levels of brightness, brightness 1 is enough for me so +1 to that. The keys aren't loose and typing on them is I think satisfying, they're somewhat quiet when pushed. People complain about how the power button is right next to the delete key, but for me personally I don't find this an issue at all.So the touch pad isn't good, your fingers don't slide over it easily, it grabs your finger basically.. really odd. It clicks great, but I won't be trying to use is at all. Would recommend a bluetooth mouse at all times. The fingerprint reader hasn't failed once.Processor & Speed - My model is the i7 7500U... It's basically an i5 7200U but with a .2Ghz quicker clock speed. Still dual core (bummer... thanks intel) and turbo boosts to 3.48Ghz. My base clock speed according to windows and also Intel's own driver software says 2.9Ghz. I wish I had gotten a model with an actual i7 instead of an i5 with an i7 badge. Fan noise is overall quiet until you run something that puts it at over 50% CPU usage but even still, it's manageable. Keep your power settings to 'Recommended' because 'High Performance' keeps it permanently turboboosted @ 3.48Ghz **The model with dedicated graphics would be worth it if you're more than a less than casual gamer.Wireless - Bluetooth is quick to reconnect a mouse when turning on the laptop. At the same spot my last laptop was, this one gets 'excellent' signal whereas my other one would get 'fair' to the sometimes 'good'.Speakers & Sound - So out of the box it doesn't sound good, neither do. You'll need to play music and then adjust the EQ to make it sound nice, but when you do it sounds as good as you can make it. My previous Dell laptop has the best speakers and the best EQ settings for headphones/speakers I've ever heard so I had to make lots of adjustments through the EQ of this laptop to make it sound as close as I can as my last computer. I got it pretty close but still not perfect, but I can live with it! The weird this is this computer comes with like 3 programs that control EQ which is very confusing, AND they all aren't mutually exclusive so they all build on each other. For this reason I recommend doing it though the 'ICEpower Audiowizard' program.
Unfortunately, I bought this out of necessity and the ASUS reputation of quality. None of which is shown in the design nor function of this computer. The battery life is atrocious. The sound quality is laughable at best, pathetic in the least. The camera is non-usable. The idea that it has two hard drives is pathetic. Everything goes to the boot drive (128 ssd) without a clear way to download apps to the bigger 1tb drive that this comes with as well. It reminds me of when phones came with the ability to attach a micro sd card but nothing could go on it that had any importance. I am very unhappy with this product but I am stuck with it because I bought it before I started classes and now I am struck with a device that makes a Chromebook look like a gaming PC. This plus the enforced addition of Microsoft Edge makes this a pathetic excuse for a computer. The best advice I can give you is do not buy this piece of crap unless you have the money to buy a functioning computer because the moment you decide to upgrade this POS you will violate the warranty.
I have had the computer for about 6 months now. So far, so good. I would give it a 4.5 stars, but as that is not an option will give it 4 stars. My main gripe so far for basic office use are: 1. while it charges super fast and perhaps that is the setting which will kill my battery, I don't think I ever would have gotten 8 hours of full work time on it, and 2. the power off button is right next to the delete key...I can not tell you how many times I have hit it by accident and switched off my computer unintentionally. However, I have not "yet" lost any valuable work as perhaps it is only putting the computer to sleep when I hit that the first time thereby saving my work. The mouse pad is not my favorite, but I did get used to it over time. Otherwise, very happy with this computer.
I'm not a computer wiz by any means so I actually had a friend of mine help me pick out a new laptop. He's very tech savvy and basically explained to me that this is probably the best bang for my buck.I don't do any gaming or social media on this. I just use it to buy more stuff I don't need on Amazon and write papers in Word. Maybe watch the occasional video. Pretty simple use so I don't know how it would handle a bigger workload.The extra hard drive is cool. Again I don't know much about computers so I just kinda have it but I'm sure if I ever wanted to download large files or anything that would be super convenient.The biometrics part is nice. You can only have one registered print so it has to be the same finger in the same spot every time which is probably my biggest complaint. I might be spoiled because my phone has I think 5 registered fingerprints so I can be in a different position or use my left hand if I want, where on this computer I can't.But I definitely like it. It's very fast and very clear. My old computer was a cheap Walmart computer so this blows it out of the water. I would definitely buy it again.
I was very nervous to buy this laptop because I wasn't sure how it would be but I love it. It's worked well for the past 2 months I've had it. It is very quick, especially when it boots up. The screen has an amazing display and there are no real issues with the product. The only downfall is that there is no CD/DVD player, and the keys aren't really backlit, but other than that it functions as it should!
I love this computer for the most part, speakers aren't that loud and the fan can be loud, but my mouse pad won't work properly sometimes and my HDMI port doesn't work. Sound through the headphone jack is low too. I found out about the HDMI port not working while I tried hooking up my computer for a class presentation. I'll probably have to send my computer in to get fixed and once the mouse pad and HDMI port gets fixed then I'll update this review to 5 stars. This is a great computer for the most part, I think I just got a lemon. I'm not rough with my computer at all and I've never dropped it either.
This laptop has a feel of very high quality. Also, the parts have good quality for the price. My wife uses it for studying, and leaves everything open. The memory in the laptop has been able to handle everything open, and the ssd drive makes the boot time quick. Another great feature is the battery life. It has a really long lasting battery. This is a good laptop for someone looking for a higher end model laptop for work.
This is a pretty solid laptop. I purchased it about a week ago and it has performed above/beyond my expectations. I switched to this laptop from a Toshiba Satellite, which had such a low processing power that it took an hour for chrome to open. This has an i7 processor which keeps its speeds crisp and quick. To make things easy, I will outline the pros:1. Fast, good processing2. Back-lit Keyboard3. Lightweight, Portable4. Excellent USB Port Access (3 of them)5. Crisp, Vibrant Screen Resolution6. Reasonable Battery Life for a laptop of this size, price rangeThere are a few cons though, but they aren't significant enough for me to lower my rating.1. No CD drive - but this is something I understand since most laptops are made without them nowadays.2. I noticed that removing/inserting anything USB-related is a bit cumbersome. The ports seem a bit too tight for accomadation3. Poor Webcam: the built-in webcam is grainy and is low quality.Thus far, everything else seems pretty good. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. We'll see how well this laptop works over the next few months to years. I will edit this review accordingly.
Great laptop for the price. It meet or exceeded all my expectations after reading many of the reviews on here and from other research online. My last laptop was an Asus that had held up very well and still performs pretty well, so I wanted to stay with a brand that I've been able to rely on. The fingerprint sensor makes logging in a breeze and it stays up from the scan nearly instantly. Occasionally there is a little lag but nothing to bad. This has everything I need for my usage and I'll probably never touch more than half the memory but it's nice to have such a large amount of storage just in case. I've been using it for about a month and a half and no issues have come up with it.
Bought this computer (about 3 months ago) because I wanted something mid range that was travel friendly and could handle basic gaming. I'm happy to say that this laptop meets all of those criteria. Super light weight and boots up fast. I can play league of legends for hours without any issue. Some points that may be helpful to some people: My computer crashed after playing games and having a video open in Chrome. From my experience the computer life is no where near what is advertised. It's more like 5-6 hours rather then 10. Also, a bit disappointed that it didn't come with a longer, more sturdy power cord with a ground. Just came with a standard two pronged power adapter. All that said though, I'm very happy with my purchase. Definitely a good buy if you're looking for something travel friendly, and something that can handle standard tasks plus a little more.
As an experienced Windows 10 user, this laptop was absolutely beyond my expectations after I purchased it. I've had it for almost 3 months and the performance is amazing. It's very fast even on slower internet speeds, and weighs very little with a very sleek design. I can store almost anything with the storage capabilities. I rated this laptop 5 stars because I couldn't imagine anything better. The only thing I would change if I could is the quality of the webcam. It's low pixel and not the best for video chatting. The speakers are okay with adequate bass. I've only had Dell laptops before but I will definitely be purchasing Asus again in the future.
A great laptop. The weight is a killer spec. Only 1.6 kilogram which is 1.5 times less then my previous 15" laptop. The screen is ok (better then my previous laptop but not as good as my desktop). SSD+HDD combo is good if you need both speed and storage. I initially thought that just SSD would be a better option so it would be a little bit lighter and spent less power (but would have less storage). Battery is disappointing a little bit (it is not a long lasting one. I initially thought it would be enough for a day, but it is actually for 3-5 hours of work).I like the keyboard and touchpad. As well as fingerprint which allows to log in quickly.Overall great product.
This is a great computer, be it a laptop or a vivo book. No matter what you call it it works. I love the metal body and the finish on it. It has all the things I wanted including ,i7, I have used Asus help/chat line several times and they have been great about walking me through any problem I was having.
This was purchase for my wife. She loves it. She is very impressed with the performance. The slim, light weight package is a plus.
This product is great, and I would highly recommend it.
Great Screen Size and not too Heavy, Thinner than most. Amazon Prime Delivery Delayed
I have had this laptop for a few days now and I love it! It is very fast. The only thing that I wish it had (and I knew this before purchasing) is a numeric keypad, so I have to use the number buttons on the top. The fingerprint scanner is also a very nice feature.
Lightweight and has solid state drive which makes it start up super fast. I also like that the keyboard design helps keep it clean, My previous laptop accumulated all sorts of stuff between the keys. However it is a bit too sensitive for me and any small touch is interpreted as a movement. Also the battery life does not 6 hours as stated.
Itâs so lightweight! Iâve had it for about two months. Donât love the mouse/trackpad at all, but thatâs easily solved by using a plug in.
Light, good size screen, fast, and reliable!
I bought this on impulse, I didn't intend to buy another laptop for at least two or three years.But after seeing my daughter with a computer that had an SSD, I will admit to jealousy.My old computer took about three minutes to start and was much slower than her's was and I guess that stuck in my thoughts.I was idly looking on here for another Asus that had an SSD and couldn't find one for my normal five hundred dollars and under price when I clicked on this and was like a schoolgirl with a crush.The processor, HD screen, SSD, plus another 1TB memory, I added it to my cart and bought it.I had regret for a few days until it came and I opened the box and saw it, I had been intending to return it but, instant puppy-love hit me again.Three people have asked to buy my older computer, but I have refused because I still feel an attachment for the old one.
Love this! I was hesitant on buying an Asus just because I've always been a Mac girl, but I'm very pleased with this so far.
Absolutely LOVE this laptop. Very lightweight.
Turns on quickly. Strong wireless connection. Very portable and light weight. Fast processing. Probably the best computer I've ever purchased.
Typing responsiveness is fast, log in time fast, overall performance fast. This company has taken laptop use to a whole new level. I use it for school and have no problem paring it via Bluetooth to any other device necessary.
I bought this for my son, a first year college student, and he is very pleased with the performance with this machine.
Awesome exactly what I expected best laptop ever....
Very happy with this computer! I bought it to replace an older ASUS which served me faithfully for eight years. Was time to replace it with another ASUS.
Love this computer! Great purchase for the money. It's quick and reliable. No complaints!
The keyboard failed within a month and a half. I tried communicating with Asus but they did not help. Amazon let me return it late but I only got a refund for 80%.
Love it. Received in good quality and with backlit keyboard. However the excel inside need to be re-installed for the account keeps showing unlicensed. The 15.6 inch screen looks great.
Great price, great features and a good looking laptop!!!
This computer DOES NOT WORK WITH ANY HEADSET/MIC. Per Tech Support, if it uses a headphone, it cannot also use a mic. RIDICULOUS! DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WILL EVER WANT TO USE A HEADSET/MIC!
Donât get me wrong: this laptop is light years ahead of any computer I have ever owned. It is slim, light, fast, great lookingâ?I really wanted one that had an SSD and hard drive so I could work quickly but store a lot of photographs and at work. But for streaming video it is terrible â?the sound is very quiet and very muffled. I donât want to have to get external speakers or wear headphones every time I want to watch a show. Havenât decided if Iâm going to return it but Iâm very disappointed.
I was the best choice! I am so happy with this purchase
CPU problem, fan overruns most of the time (even when simple websites in use) over %100, freezing and not responding to mouse pad. Returned for an another unit...
nice screen. like the touch pad.
Absolutely wonderful! works well and just what i needed.
Excelente producto, recomendable!
nice laptop...quick and responsive.
Fan was making noise.
Excelente pc
Very goodð
Amazing computer. Does everything I want it to. Speakers are crap and so is webcam
my laptop is shutting down 2-3 times in week showing errors always different i tried contact product support twice and nobody answered to me and when i contacted ASUS support service they told me what i need to do and on the end they told me that it has internal issue but seller or even product support is not reacting on my emails ...
Overall, the laptop works well while having an appealing design -- however, there are many different factors that will make you hate this computer. First, the graphics are terrible -- even with Intel integrated graphics, the computer cannot manage to perform tasks that are simple in terms of graphical demand. While the computer can run videos on YouTube, it cannot manage to run Netflix (I have 150mbps, so it is not due to my internet connection). The image usually appears extremely blurry, and there is nothing you can do to resolve this issue. Secondly, the speakers sound average at best, but the major issues are due to the speaker's location, which is directly under the computer -- you must have the computer on a straight, solid surface in order to hear the sound -- placing your laptop on your bed or carpet will make the sound very difficult to hear. Thirdly, the battery life is terrible -- if I'm doing the slightest amount of work on my computer, the battery is dead within 1-3 hours. Lastly, if you are into gaming, this computer fails in every category. Obviously, this computer is not designed to handle gaming, but playing games that are very basic, two dimensional, and primitive can barely run. On the plus side, this laptop will fulfill all of your basic needs (Word, PowerPoint, email, small projects, video chat).To reiterate, here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Lightweight- Attractive Design- Performs Small Application Very Well- Light-Up Keyboard- Easy-To-Type Keyboard- Can Handle Programming- Overall Reliable- Thin DesignCons:- Highly Overpriced- Fails To Run Many Applications- Bad Battery Life- Graphics Are Terrible And Replacing The Graphics Card Will Not Help Much (It Is The Computer Itself)- Cannot Be Used For Entertainment Purposes (Netflix, Gaming)
fastest PC out there
love it
Good build quality,light weight.Easy to carry around anywhere.Sleek design.Not the best audio quality,but is good for people who use it for office work.People using it for media purposes,its not the best option.
User observations on the ASUS VivoBook S:The Intel Core i7-7500U 2.7GHz processor lets me bring up applications far more quickly than on any computer I have had before.Even though the laptop frame size is what traditionally has house a 14â?monitor, the narrow bezel allows it to hold a 15.6â?monitor it seems larger.There is no wasted space and it uses almost the entire monitor, making for an impressively large picture.The picture is super crisp with very sharp images.The aesthetics are great. It is lighter and slimmer than previous laptops Iâve had and has an attractive brushed metal finish that really appeals to me.My only complaint is that the Delete key is right next to the Power button. This, according to Murphyâs Law means that the likelihood that you will accidentally shut the computer off will increase in direct proportion to the importance of the document you are working on. For this reason, I give this computer four stars. Aside from that, I loved it.
I bought this for my son when he started college this fall. He LOVES it. I got it 2 days after I ordered it. The screen is nice and big, it is extremely light weight, and it is just looks nice.
It's just ok. Battery is not that great and I am having extremely irritating issues with wi-fi. It continuously loses internet connection. The internet issue started about a month ago, a few months after I purchased this. It has trouble just finding a wi-fi to connect to and when it does it loses it. I have restarted in and shut it down, waited a while, and started back up and still internet issues. When you pay over $800 for a laptop you would expect it to work perfectly for at least a year especially since I don't do much on it
Love it!
It's a great device however I received it with a dent on the lid. Very disappointing.
Awesome. Only thing I donât like it that it has no numerical keyboard . You have to use upper keyboard numbers. But otherwise awesome! I have always had good result with ASUS. A+
I wish it had a number keypad on the right hand side.
Great full-featured Windows 10 laptop. it has pretty much any port you would want, including USB Type-C for future applications. I wish that it charged like my Asus Chromebook: with USB Type-C; but I would guess it's because it uses more power than the connection can supply. Right out of the box I had an application for it: I installed Kodi with my Plex Add-on, then connected it to my TV Via HDMI and I was running home movies via my Plex server in less than 20 minutes.Like with any OEM laptop, there is some bloatware to it. I uninstalled most of it. The year subscription to McAfee is a joke: go with Comodo if you want a quality security application.
Graphics are not good. Battery life? 8hrs? Lol non- existent, more like 8 minutes. Cannot even connect to Wi-Fi properly. My old hp amda8 series... with a broken screen lol is working better. I've only had the laptop a few hours and I completely regret the purchase. The only good thing is the exterior looks bomb.
This laptop has many excellent features. It is super light so you wonât get shoulder strain if you want to carry it around all day in a laptop bag. The laptop just looks nice, from the backlit keyboard to the clear bright screen. It starts up quickly. The specs are impressive and It has performed great so far with internet use, photo editing, word processing, and some Steam gaming. I donât think this would be the best system for a hardcore gaming machine, but itâs great for games that are not extremely system demanding. It has a good size hard drive which is a definite plus. Overall, an nice machine that should perform well for someone needing to do typical home computer work and light gaming.
I would try to be as neutral as I can because even after getting the defective device, I would do a full analysis. When I received the laptop, the first impression was amazing but I was only able to use it foe about 10minutes. After configuring the windows, when I put it on charging and came back after an hour, there was no power indication and when I tried to turn it on, nothing happened. It was just like a dead machine.I would say when I turned it on in first place, the display was eye-catching but the brightness is only 250 nits at maximum. A lot of people complained about the flex in keyboard, to be honest, it was not a big deal. Likewise, the backlit on keyboard was more than satisfactory.Verdict: Its a mid-level laptop from Asus. I would recommend everyone to save some more bucks and go for some high end device e.g. Xps 13 or 15, Hp Spectre, Lenovo X1 Carbon.
DOWNGRADED to 2 stars because of the supplied Operating System. Don't buy unless you're willing to format. The Win 10-Home that comes with it is USELESS. I'm losing many hours of work because the unmanageable updates are constantly breaking my programs. The audio pops all the time and the video on my HDMI began to spaz out after one of these unrequested updates.UPDATE: upgraded to Win 10 per ASUS support suggestion and it has solved NOTHING !! It's fast but all the quirks will drive you crazy. Go find a Toshiba or Lenovo.UPDATE: ASUS support completely clueless. Tells me to format. They have no real 2nd tier knowledge to solve problems. They just e-mail people telling them to format.
Se demorÃ³ en llegar la ASUS
I failed to see that this thing doesn't have an optical drive....
I paid over $1,500 for this Asus. Had it 15 months. It stopped working. I took it back to Best Buy to get it repaired. I was told it would cost more to have it repaired than to purchase a new one. To bad I paid cash.No recourse. Purchase an Asus at your own risk.
After being an 18 year plus Dell customer I decided to go with the Chromebook. Much better on so many levels than my 11.6 in Dell touch screen that went dead after 11 months. I am still trying to figure out how to do a right click on my touch pad so I can correct spelling errors etc.
Bought this couple days ago for my business and i love it, battery life is lasting.... really really love it
Laptop didnât even last 3 weeks before it stopped turning on.
I love this little chrome book. Perfect for my real estate presentations. Not great for printing at the office.
Bought it for my grand daughter for school. She loves it. Does everything she needs and some.
Great I am really impressed with the performnce of this laptop. For such an inexpensive model itâs really a great laptop.
I did a standard shipping on the 15 and got it in 3 days ð. This is great especially as for me being a college student.
Awesome unit!!!
Bought this thinking I was getting a new laptop and nowhere in description does it mention refurbished, used etc. only to find out someone has already had a password setup on this laptop by the name of Eric.anderson and computer is locked. No initial setup popped up like new computers normally do. If I wanted a used laptop Iâd buy a used one.
Had it for 2 weeks, works great but I dropped it 1.5 feet from the grown, the top screen did crack
Acer Predator 17 Gaming Laptop, Core i7, GeForce GTX 1070, 17.3" Full HD G-SYNC, 16GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD, G9-793-79V5The Acer Predator G9-793-79V5 is probably the best choice I made for a gaming laptop, I really was tempted to get an Asus ROG but after checking the specs between them I believe this one convinced me. Will try to be as detailed as possible.* THE GOOD:+ 17" diagonal LCD IPS screen providing native 1920x1080 resolution.+ nVidia GTX 1070 graphics.+ Illuminated keyboard + keypad.+ Hotkey / macro profiles on the left side, switch button allows to store up to 15 macros+ OS very clean, not a lot of bloatware to complain of and the Acer utilities include a wi-fi analyzer which in turn allows to configure better wi-fi channels for better network performance.+ 2x128Gb M.2 (B+M) key SSD + 1Tb 7200 SATA HD.+ 16Gb RAM out of the box plus 2 easy access slots on the back for expansion.+ USB 3.0 ports layout is good, not spread all over and spaced nicely to connect multiple devices without blocking each other.* THE BAD:- Heavy and large but again its 17" made for gaming or to replace a desktop so deal with it.- Proper gaming sessions require power brick connected, power brick rated for 230W output.- Quick start guide very simple instructions, you actually need to download the manual to learn most of its tricks.- 2x128Gb M.2 (B+M) key in RAID-0 configuration. (Read below)- Locked "InsydeH20" BIOS. (Read below)- Basic optical media, DVD reader / writer, my previous computer was an HP Pavilion dv6 and could read Blu-Ray discs.Let me give you my biggest beefs to a couple of the "BAD" things.* Having 2 SSD drives is a big bonus, but using them in a RAID-0 array its pointless, because they are SSD's, they are fast already and the RAID-0 gain in so minimal that the computer actually wastes time writing on 2 devices instead of 1.* This problem with RAID 0 is compounded due the fact that Acer decided to lock the BIOS so the SATA mode is set to RAID and preventing end users to change it. Again this is a major mistake. In the event of RAID array failure the user cannot reinstall software or may not recover at all since the configuration setting is locked.At this point some of you who know how to work with RAID-0 arrays may think. "Surely that kind of problem is very rare."Sadly it is not, before this review I received this same computer and while running it through its paces the RAID array failed.Because RAID was locked in BIOS I could not use an image I made at first and the Acer recovery tools and recovery management were unable to reinstall the software or rebuild the array from scratch.This also prevents users from upgrading to bigger SSD drive sizes, I am unaware of the RAID array will be rebuilt on a bigger SSD drive, plus the SSD slots and space for them may cause problem installing a new SSD. (See pictures)Acer really needs to unlock the BIOS and give the option to the users to configure the computer as they see fit and its not really that hard. After speaking with Acer support he claimed that users can unlock the BIOS but its not Acer's policy to disclose how to do it. So I assume the unlock procedure is just a backdoor or master password to unlock all features.Now a bit on the good side:This is a laptop computer but you want to use it on a table for comfort, when its running at full speed it gets warm BUT the lap portion remains relatively cool. Using the overclocking options the most heat came from the rear away from the lap and even away from the keyboard, even graphic-intensive games were run very smoothly at "Ultra" settingsIn the end I think the GOOD overcome the BAD and its a solid purchase for both work and entertainment for the next couple years and if Acer stops trying to tie leashes on the customers it will be a great purchase for everyone else.** 08/12/2017 A bit of more updates. **Around 1 month after I got the computer have used it to convert movies with handbrake and while all 4 cores work at full I see no extra heat coming out from the back, heat output remains at a steady 97F-98F.While people like to use test programs like heaven and others I prefer to use somewhat intensive applications.I run Second life at Ultra settings and Space Engineers online and they both run quite smoothly, very little (if any) visual lag.The most delays I notice is when using the SATA hard drive for the programs but using the SSD's pretty much prevents that.Still trying to get ACER to spit the BIOS backdoor/master password to unlock all features but no success so far.** 08/22/2017 More updates. **With the help from ACER predator forums I learned I could update from the 2x128Gb RAID-0 to a single 512Gb NVMe M.2 stick by removing both SSD's and placing the new one then restore a full backup upon the new drive so as not lose any existing data. (No need to make changes to BIOS except boot order)The process took 2 or 3 tries before getting it right but it worked, with the single NVMe drive the predator is not just fast.It flies!Loading time from Power-Up to Windows 10 login is 7 seconds flat.Afterwards I connected one of the remaining 128Gb sticks to the M.2 SATA connector and using Inter Rapid Storage GUI inside windows broke its RAID setting so I can use it instead to install programs on it.So now I have 3 drives:1x512Gb NVMe M.2 SSD stick.1x128Gb SATA M.2 SSD stick1x1Tb SATA 7200 HD.
This laptop is absolutely amazing, everything came in perfect. I am always worried about getting a lemon when buying a gaming laptop, and all the reviews out there.After deleting the bloatware, and upgrading all my drivers, this machine is a absolute beast.The price I got mine at was good as well, being that the MSI, and Asus equivalents where a bit more. Me being a solid Asus ROG series man for years I was leary jumping ships but so far I am extremely pleased.The vents, and the extra cool fan you can pop in keep this thing extremely cool.I messed around a little with the overclocking and it got a little warm, but I don't see why you would want to since it runs most tittles with ease.All around I would highly recommend this gaming laptop to anyone.
First off, I want to say that I am incredibly happy with my purchase. After doing a lot of research on laptops with great build quality, specs, and price, I settled on the Acer Predator 17. The amount of sheer horsepower this laptop has is simply incredible. You can easily run any game on max settings with 70+ FPS. I'm really enjoying playing Fortnite, Dark Souls 3, Overwatch, and Witcher 3 on maximum graphics and buttery smooth framerates. With my opening remarks out of the way, let me get started on the details!In my review, I'm going to try to break down each aspect of this laptop to help you make an informed purchasing decision.-----------------PREFORMANCE: 10/10Okay, I pretty much already said this in the intro, but this laptop is an absolute MONSTER in terms of sheer power. This is rocking a 7th gen intel i7 7700HQ and a NVIDIA GTX 1070. If you're not caught up on hardware, let me just tell you that these specs are simply incredible. Nvidia's new Pascal GPU arcitecture on the GTX 10-series really shines through and gives you beautiful performance in all gaming tasks. The processor is incredible as well. Additionally, you're also given 16 GBs of RAM and a nicely sized SSD, so boot up times are speedy and you can run plenty of software concurrently.KEYBOARD AND MOUSE: 10/10This is not something I can explain to you in a review. This is something you have to experience in person. The keyboard and touchpad on this laptop are seriously top notch. The keyboard has a nice, satisfying click with substantial feedback and a nice, quiet clack sound; it really feels like a quality piece of hardware. Same goes for the trackpad and the buttons.Oh, and the rainbow backlight is absolutely incredible. Itâs something you have to see in person to appreciate.DISPLAY: 7/10The display is beautiful with vibrant colors and good brightness, but there are a few issues I want to point out. First, letâs just say it â?it has a 1080p display. You can see individual pixels if you look closely, and frankly thatâs not a good thing. I donât mind that they didnât go for a 4k display, but even a 1440p monitor would have fixed this problem.Apart from being low definition, another issue with the display is the refresh rate and latency. This laptop has a refresh rate of 60hz with G-SYNC, which means you can never have any games appear higher that 60fps, even if your GPU can handle rendering it at higher FPS. The latency is about 20ms, which means the display is about 0.02 seconds delayed on everything you do. This is fine for me, but serious gamers might not appreciate it.Overall the display is very vibrant and âgood enoughâ?for the most part.DESIGN: 6/10I know this appeals to a lot of gamers, but frankly I think itâs over the top and Iâd prefer a sleek black design. Seriously, who wants to go to Starbucks and open up their huge 17â?laptop with bright red LED backlights and the words âPREDATORâ?imprinted on the back? Youâre going to look like a goon, itâs a simple as that. Some people might like it, but personally itâs not for me.BUILD QUALITY & COOLING: 10/10This thing feels solid and substantial. I donât know what else to say other than that in terms of build quality. It just feelsâ?great! As for cooling, the laptop ships with an extra fan that you can replace the DVD drive with. This keeps all computer components at a nice cool temperature even during the most demanding tasks. Fantastic build quality and cooling overall.ANNOYANCES:There are a few really annoying issues with this laptop. First and foremost, THERE ARE NO VOLUME ADJUSTMENT HOTKEYS. This means that if you want to change the volume while you're in a game or watching a movie, you have to Alt-Tab to the desktop and change the settings manually. I find this to be an EXTREME NUISANCE. I recently downloaded a program that lets me adjust volume from anywhere with Ctrl + Down / Up arrow, but this is not something I should have to install myself.Next, this laptop is really heavy. Itâs a bit inconvenient to carry around and itâs very tough to fit in a normal sized backpack.OVERALL RATING: 9/10All gripes aside, when it comes down to the actual âcomputingâ?part of this computer, itâs simply amazing and you wonât find anywhere near as good a price for similar specs and build quality. When it comes down to it, the Acer Predator 17 is a fantastic choice for a gaming laptop, and if you get it I guarantee youâll be extremely happy with your purchase decision.-----------------I hope this was helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment on my review and Iâd be happy to help you as best I can.- Peter
Doing well so far. I do not see any screen bleeding. Tried getting Windows/BIOS/Nvidia drivers updated at work. Let me say that you will want to immediately remove the startup sound set in the BIOS... super annoying. I will report back on specs and performance.UPDATE:Still need to look into the BIOS issues (VT-x or RAID settings or overclocking manually), but the monitor is NOT 60hz, it is 75hz (which was awesome to find out, since ACER and everyone else keeps saying it is 60hz). Gsync does work with the monitor (once you update the BIOS). No screen bleeding or stuttering. No heat issues. No issues with Windows, except ones that Windows caused themselves. I have been playing Conan with ultimate settings and have not went over 60C. Hard drives a bit slow, but not a big issue. Only wish they were not RAID 0, especially since I have spent hours downloading updates for games via Steam. Thought I'd want the DVD drive, but now all games require online activation and updating day 1, so it doesn't really need this. Hardly any bloatware (office 365 trial and maybe 2 others). Software from ACER is great, especially Predatorsense, which allows overclocking, but the optimization software could be a bit better like AVG:PC Tuneup. I will try to keep updating this. Great buy so far! Only complaint is the locked BIOS and RAID setup at the moment. Build is solid. Keyboard is amazing, but could be recessed a bit more for comfort. Trackpad is great, but a bit sticky, as there is a bit of friction with the material they chose, which may go away after use anyway. Keyboard is zoned backlighting but looks great. Fans are quiet. I don't see what everyone was talking about when it came to the fans being noisey. WIFI is super fast. I think I may have covered all the issues I have seen reported... I think they were just one-offs. Colors display great on monitor with a good refresh rate. Power cord is shaped a bit strange, as it lies across the cd drive, due to a 90 degree turn in the cord at the computer-side plug. Sound is good enough. Oh, the symbol on the back DOES light up, along with the running stripes on the back. I dislike that my window key is disabled when the trackpad is turned off, but I understand why they did this. Just wish I had a way to turn off the backlighting at the push of a button, but there may be a way to do this that I haven't found yet(except for running off of battery). I got some Kryonaut paste (the best for novices), but I don't think I will ever need it, even with overclocking in Turbo mode. You get a little over 2-hr of web time on battery and probably more if you adjust powersaving options. KillerEthernet program is great for blocking programs from using your bandwidth. I will hopefully be able to try to break RAID, as advised per the ACER boards, and get an NVMe SSD. I guess most of the BIOS settings people are concerned about can be adjusted from Windows or software, just like this RAID setting (and overclocking and G-sync, which also required the BIOS update and VT-x, which I am told is already enabled by default) I will try to update with info about this and if it does truly allow VT-x for Virtual Machines and if I ever move away from the RAID setup. I am rambling. I would say to go ahead and buy this one! Feel free to leave questions... I will try to check back.
Got this as workstation and as a gaming device, to replace my now aging desktop pc. I could have updated the CPU, motherboard, memory and video card, and get another desktop, but just the video cards nowadays cost about 1200 dollars; so the thing was not feasible, and went for a laptop; in the meantime that prices go back to normal.The whole thing is solid; heavy; and give you a great feel of being resilient when you use it. The trackpad is decently sized and works fine; although it is not super precise, but I use the laptop mostly as desktop replacement, connected to wireless mouse and keyboard.The LCD screen is pretty nice and bright; refresh rate is great; and works fine for most of the activities; but I have the laptop connected to a bigger monitor on my desk, so I don't use it all the time. Colors are pretty bright and vivid; took a bit to calibrate it but then you can let it be and enjoy it.The keyboard is awesome; I feel very comfortable typing on it; and the resistance and spacing of the keys is perfect for me (I have big hands); I still make mistakes because the layout of the keyboard on the right side is not the same as a standard PC keyboard; but once you remember that the delete key is right on top of the backspace, and that the enter key is not as big as it was, then it is a breeze. Plus it has a ton of light settings; not a fan of flashy ones, but the red hue is quite nice.CPU and GPU works great; got some awesome results from 3dsmax, Visual Studio and other Adobe apps like Photoshop and Dimension; which made me very happy, since the main usage of this computer is portable graphic workstation. Unity works great too, and with 16 GB of RAM, you have plenty to run concurrent and memory-intensive apps.SSD is small; and it is weird since it is a raid made of 2x128 GB M2 drive; but it works fast and it is fine for me. The computer has a 1 TB mechanical drive, which won't win any contest for speed, but it is reliable and awesome to have inside the computer, to store large amount of data.The computer comes with a DVD combo drive, which can be swapped for an extra fan; I did ditch both and got an extra caddy to put an extra SATA SSD drive; and the process was painless. Now I have 2 TB of storage plus the 256 GB of system drive, and all without opening the laptop or buy external enclosures.Sound is OK; I didn't buy it for that, the internal audio card works as expected with headphones; and the internal speakers are quite loud and nice to listen to; but for movie watching, use your headphones.The fan is not that loud; not sure where you live, but in my office room, with everything else going on, I can't hear it at all, even when it is full throttle. I never got the laptop very hot, neither when playing games nor rendering in 3dsmax or working in Unity; so I guess I was lucky with the thermal compound job they did at the factory.Games run fast here; got Witcher 3 at max details and it runs smooth as silk; same for other games that are very demanding, like Tomb Raider. The scores for 3dmark are a bit lower than a desktop overclocked 1070 with an i7 8th gen; due to the fact that the laptop versions are usually clocked lower for power and heat management issues, but I won't loose my sleep for few frames lost. If you are a purist, get a desktop computer.Battery life is a joke, but this is a desktop replacement. The main issue is the lack of energy saving process, which would switch to the Intel onboard GPU, but this does not happen; the 1070 is always on and this means that the battery goes down fast (about 2.5 hours of usage, 50m if rendering). Plugged in, no problem, but if you plan to move around with this beast in tow; keep in mind that you need to be close to a plug most of the time (although in this case, you would get an ultra light model).Software onboard was not super intrusive; I did remove the extras I do not need; and left the Acer app, that is great for backup, restore and overall managing the computer drivers and get the info like serial number and such. W10 works just fine.It has 4 USB3 ports on the sides, and 1 USB-C Thunderbolt; so if you plan to use an external GPU one day, you can do so. Future proof is great.The other ports are the power connector; a SD card reader (always welcome to avoid to use a dongle), and a display port (full port, thank God) and a HDMI port, with the LAN port to guarantee connectivity at top speed. It has also a mic and headphone jack, which are also great.VR works great on this computer; the Rift runs smooth and nicely; setup was easy and also using external monitors works great (got an ultra-wide screen connected to it).In conclusion; great specs, decent price for what you get, and VR ready; perfect as game machine and as workstation; can't really complain much about anything.
After hours of research and even one returned MSI, I ended up with an Acer Predator 17 i7-7700HQ GTX1070 8GB. This thing is massive power in a massive body. It's honestly probably too powerful since the display is only 1080p and 75hz so you might want to consider just going with the GTX 1060 version.Pros: Runs anything on ultra, stays super cool, great build quality, doesn't look as bad in person. Cons: over 10 pounds with the power supply, you'll need a special bag to carry it, definitely has that gamer look to it.This thing is a performance machine. With a GTX 1070 it can take all you throw at it. However, the 75hz 1080p display will leave you wanting more. Wish it at least came with a 1440p display and 120hz. I think there was an option that did but it didn't have the IPS display and whatever. It's fine. I also like the number of ports. It's got enough USB ports and even a thunderbolt 3 which I didn't find on many competitors.Cooling is fantastic. I read test results and found it ran cooler than MSI and ASUS competitors. My MSI ran so hot I thought I was going to burn myself. The i7-7700 seems to run hot and CAM keeps alerting me that the CPU hit over 80 degrees. Intel says this is normal so I'm not too worried.Construction: The Predator feels solid. In pictures the body looks cheap and the red keys look really tacky but in person it's really well done. The soft touch plastic has a nice feel and the red keys are semi-tacky but I really don't mind. Besides, I'm not bringing this thing to Starbucks to work and at 9.4 pounds you won't want to bring this monster anywhere and if you do, you'll need a special bag because it won't fit in regular 17" bags. I chose the ASUS ROG Shuttle backpack since the Predator bag was twice the price. It also has that gamer look to it so if you want stealth, I'd recommend the Gigabyte 17" version which is a lot cleaner and has the same specs.Other pros, the keyboard is fantastic and the touchpad is really smooth. Hated the touchpad on my MSI and the mouse buttons were hard to press. Downside to construction: the wrist rest has a sharpish edge and can dig into your arm after a while. A rounded or angled front edge would make the laptop more comfortable, especially since it's so thick. That's really the only complaint...Overall: Yeah, I'm pretty psyched about the Predator. It really wasn't on my radar at all while shopping and the horrible pictures really turned me off. After having my heart set on a ROG or MSI, I was stunned to finally go with Acer but so far so good. Really no regrets (other than that I should have bought a tower instead lol)Oh one last thing, the startup sound can EASILY be turned off in like 3 steps. Just google it and everyone in a 2-mile radius will thank you. Acer if you're reading this, get rid of it.Hopefully this helps you choose a new laptop! Enjoy whatever you buy!
Fantastic laptop. I used an Asus G73 for about 6 years and finally replaced it with the Acer Predator 17 based on my extensive research. Every gaming laptop has some issue that people do not like. This laptop has the "locked bios issue" which doesn't really bother me as I may not ever need to upgrade the SSD's. This laptop runs ALL the latest games in the highest settings with no problems. I almost never hear the fans kick on to full. But just a warning, when the fans are on full, you better be using headphones! The frostcore doesn't seen to help too much but as i generally have no need for a DVD, I just leave the frostcore in (the frostcore is included with the laptop). I have only had the laptop for about a month now but so far it has been great and I am extremely happy with this machine, I did NOT receive any discount on this machine for my review. I hope it helps people doing research like when I did.
Pros:- Well made, sturdy.- Powerful, no doubt.- Pretty quiet for this type of laptop.- Very nice keyboard. Actually best laptop keyboard I've ever worked with.- IPS monitor.- It doesn't looks ridiculous like on pictures. It was the biggest concern of mine about this laptop, so it is a big pro for me. It looks a bit aggressive though, with all lights on (which you can turn off) but nothing more.Cons:- Heavy. Along with the adapter, which has a weight and a shape of a real brick, it makes a pretty heavy kit. For someone it is a desktop replacement, but I personally bought a dedicated Predator bag, which makes it somehow portable. - Fingerprints. If you have a cleaning kit and clean your laptop daily after work/gaming it won't be a problem at all.- Thermal solution. It is not great. But it is a common problem. I changed mine after a week of use and it helped to drop something like 15-20 degree Celsius. It could put to the end your warranty though, so think for yourself.- IPS backlight bleed. Mine arrived with very little bleed in the top right corner. Can see it in absolutely dark scenes on full brightness.Overall:Great laptop for the money. Best in my opinion.UPDATE: Battery drains while plugged into AC adaptor while gaming high demanded games. Should be aware of it. I didn't know that and it's a huge bummer.
Updated on 6/13/2018 w/photos, & info on the caddySo just a general update, disappointed with the external caddy. Doesn't work, had it worked i would have adapted it to fit in the torn down frostcore frame while maintaining the existing fan and just essentially rewiring it to work with also the M2 SSD port. Photos included regarding the taredown of both the frostcore and the caddy i mentioned in my original review.Also a few screenshots of the most updated software and graphics drivers that were critical (along with the wireless driver that resolves the hibernate/sleep issue also causing BSOD/wireless reciever crap out due to faulty driver/win10 update that broke things). NOTE Updating your drivers to the latest at least in my case resolved all BSOD issues.A suggestion, get a crucial/micron M2 SSD. They come with a free license to do backups/cloned images which to me, is a awesome deal for a ssd (256gb) that only costed me $12 when i bought mine.Updated on 6/12/2018 w/photos, and some extra informationOnly updated to provide photos, Will later on this week provide more updates. Looks like i may have made a error in ordering a external caddy that supports both a fan to vent, and a M2 SSD slot. May need to do some hardware modifications due to what seems to be proprietary lock/eject mechanism that is for the Acer Predator series, ontop of the non flush based external caddy. If anyone has ANY insight on where to buy actual optical drive caddy bays that have M2 SSD slot(s)/Extra fan with SATA connections, please please please post under my review with a link to the product.Reviewed on 6/11/2018:First and foremost this really got on my nerves. The Acer Predator G9-793-73MB GTX 1060 Model DOES NOT come with more than 1x 256gb M2 SSD, and 1x 1TB HDD. What isn't mentioned is that the GTX 1060 MODEL of the G9-793 series only has 1 M2 SSD bay (the secondary slot is not even on the board). Confirmed this with acer premium support, as well as literally just opening up my laptop's HDD/SSD bay to visually confirm). So if you want the Raid 0 configuration that basically means you have 2x 128gb M2 SSDs, you either need to buy the G9-793-MB GTX 1070 Model OR Buy the G9-793-73MB GTX 1060 and buy a SSD-M2/SSD Laptop Internal DVD Optical Drive Bay 2nd M.2 NGFF SSD Caddy which one i am waiting on delivery for to test which is found here --> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076WZBC8X/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and slot in your M2 SATA while also keeping the cooling fan mechanism. FYI I haven't tested this yet and am waiting on product to arrive as of this writing, but this pretty much effectively tells me if i am gonna want this model the 1060 or if im gonna return this model and get the 1070 (Graphically speaking the 1070 is what you want assuming you can afford it) but for me the 1060 fits my needs all but the Lack of the 2nd M2 Bay/connector which is NOT mentioned ANYWHERE on any of their product pages, or acers technical sheet/manuel/amazon questions/acer forums.All in all the Keyboards RGB (4 segment RGB) is what prompted me to buy this laptop over the more portable variant the Acer Predator Helios 300 (with the 1060gtx)which only has the red backlit keyboard, where as the Acer predator 15' and 17' model supports a external enclosure as well as RGB editing (configured through the predatorsense app).The venting on this thing is amazing. I personally enable the fans to run at max when doing anything intensive or GPU heavy, and never need to push the hardware to the point of overheating. The Frostcore is more of a gimmick, but it does help reduce SOME of the heat (about 5-9% of the heat) of the laptop when its working at max load while over clocked. By the WAY, overclocked on a gtx 1050-1070 WILL literally eat through your battery while on Turbo mode for both the GPU being overclocked through predatorSense as well as the CPU being overclocked (and taxed at 100% cpu & 100% gpu) utilization. Helping keep this laptop quite cool even under heavy load.Love the fact this one came with a Samsung SSD, bought another 256gb SSD same day i purchased the laptop so everything would arrive, thats when i had found out what i mentioned being my major irk. So when the Laptop Internal DVD Optical Drive Bay 2nd M.2 NGFF SSD Caddy arrives ill beable to throw in the other 256gb SSD and go from there. I'll update this review once i get it and verify & test it (given it also has a built in fan which basically looks identical to the one in the frostcore minus all the fancy coloring and presentation) ill update that as well. Wanna test out how the predatorsense program senses the 3rd party "M2/SSD-Frostcore" Combo (where this time its not called frostcore)All and all the 16gb of RAM is fine for me, but im probably gonna upgrade it to 64gb with 16gb RAM chips (4x in total) later on depending on how much ram ill need. Realistically, ill need no more than 8gb, and 16gb is plenty even for a majority of what i do, which is gaming/minor server configuring/testing. The C-Force CF003 USB 3.1 DOES work with the Acer Predator G9-793-73MB GTX 1060 (6gb) for routing HDMI audio/video through the Hub. As a added bonus works with nintendo switch, and other USB C/Thunderbolt equipped devices (the hub) that is. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BX96YNV/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 I am able to confirm that the Acer Predator 17 Model G9-793-73MB does work with the usb C (thunderbolt) for HDMI out, as well as a usb 3.1x hub. Same concept, the arrows MUST be pointing upwards (visible to you when plugged in) on the CF003 on the laptops USB C connector as well as the arrow aligned on the CF003. BIG side note, you can actually also have the arrow pointing downward on the USB C port on the pc, AND the CF003 (Just make sure the arrow ISNT aligned with the arrow) and it will work. Same thing for the nintendo switch. Haven't tested the adaptor with a straight USB C to USB C connector (reverse/same side) connector yet though. I wanted to mention the part about the Thunderbolt USB C port supporting any format adaptor that is USB C to Output adaptor given the Technical manual provided by acer DOES STATE that only a Thunderbolt USB C to Display adaptor is the only thing supported (it does not explicitly state that any other digital video out is unsupported, as well as if audio out is unsupported) pretty vague on acers site as well as what their techs know given how vague the answer is in the literal technical manual. Also the Thunderbolt USB C port DOES NOT support reverse charging IE, you can't use that port to charge your laptop battery. Just won't work. I can completely confirm that i can hook up 2x monitors at the same time on the laptop (through the built in HDMI/Display port & using the thunderbolt port) while also keeping the laptops own screen in active service (That makes it 3 monitors active same time), i think you can do a 3rd one with the Display port, making it a total of 3 external monitor/tv devices & the existing built in laptop screen making it a total of 4 display devices altogether. I need more monitors to confirm this (only have 2 at the moment) so anyone who can test and confirm this, that would be good to know regarding the model G9-793-73MB GTX 1060/1070 for the Acer Predator 17' series. BIG key notes to keep in mind for the ending part of this review, UPDATE all the drivers manually including the software. PredatorSense, the BIOS, KillerWifi (drivers & management application), Nvidia GTX xxxx (where x = model of GPU) because if you DO NOT update these things manually win10 will update them for you, and you will find out your machine will literally suffer from BSOD (Blue screen of death) Due to read/write errors or some other randomness caused by the win10 updates. DO NOT trust win10 updates for everything this is how you effectively kill your machine slowly through trusting microsoft to apropriately load the right drivers for you (which will be what causes the BSOD, at least in my case on multiple reimaged tests of win10 home x64 and win10 pro x64). Another noteable thing about this, is that even though it is windows 10 home x64, it is NOT PRO, meaning you don't have the features available. The laptop DOES NOT support win10 x64 PRO the normal way, you need to buy the license for win10 pro, and then from ground up re-install the win10 OS (win10 pro x64) and then manually reinstall all the specially loaded software to get the laptop to a win10 pro x64 licensed copy. This laptop DOES NOT allow you to do win10 store purchase/upgrade to win10 pro, some weird technical glitch that i could not get any direct confirmation from microsoft stating that the laptop does not explicitly support the pro edition of win10 x64. I will upload photos/videos/links to the apropriate drivers later on when i recieve the other last component for the laptop as well as correct any spelling errors, and resummarize my experience with the hardware and further test out the device.IF you are going to buy this laptop keep a watchful eye on it, i've seen its price fluxuate well over 200-500+ off deals through amazon directly (not 3rd party sellers), and it is constantly in a state of flux. I Bought the laptop for $1,349 USD. You may buy it for more/less depending on what time you do, do the purchase to lock in that lower price. Sometimes the 1060 is the better deal, othertimes the 1070 is being sold for lower than the 1060. Lots of confusion with amazon on this process so just a general FYI regarding purchasing this predator laptop model.
Pros:A lot of computer for the price!It has 2x m.2 SSDs (mine were 2 128GB) running in RAID 0 and a 1TB hard drive with space for one more. It came with 16GB DDR4 RAM and has two empty expansion slots, so upgrading is definitely a Plus. The backlight of the keyboard is decided into 4 zones and the color can be changed per zone. It comes with really good speakers and has an integrated subwoofer. The IPS display has extremely good viewing angles and can be set very brightly. The surface is rubberized and the touch pad has distinct buttons not integrated into the pad itself which is a huge plus! It can also be turned off and there are programmable keys with a profile switch. Also, connectivity and connections are aplenty.Not so Pros: The profile switching does not change the keyboard backlights correctly. When on Normal mode on battery, 1080P YouTube videos don't play correctly because the energy saving options are too aggressive. The subwoofer is a nice touch, but the engineers should have test d it with the keyboard installed. The keyboard rattles rather annoyingly when the bass beats. There is a second SATA drive bay empty but the couple cents cable for a second HDD is not included and it is outrageously priced on the secondary market. In Germany, there is one trader offering it for <â? (but in back order) and in the United States, you cannot find it for less than $19.99 and even up to almost $40 - since Acer does not offer it to the end consumer nor included it. For a premium product, this is not good. At last, why does it come with Win10 Home and not Win10 Pro? Encryption is a thing, you know?
Starting with the experience of having it in front of me and touching it, it's great. For those (including Acer staff) who say it's a 60 Hz display...they are wrong 'cause it comes with a 75 Hz monitor! It was a great discovering for me. The temperature management is fantastic and the level of noise emissions is very low from my point of view, considering the huge amount of noise a simple Toshiba Satellite I have produces only opening an Excell file. So far I've test it with Alien Isolation at full graphics configuration and CPU temp is arround 81 degrees but with a curtain at 20cm from the rear exhaust. GPU is between 50 and 60 degrees. So far I had no need for using the extra fan and don't think I'll be necessary. The display is very nice with smooth gameplay thanks to G-Sync and the sound very powerfull and clear including some bass. If you're on the fence like I was, I strongly recommend it, you won't regret it. I spend a month doing research and know I feel I took the right choice. There are many light weight powerfull gaming laptops out there but not with this termal management and built quality.
I really like this laptop. It is indeed quite fast especially noticeable at startup. Note that two slots for the memory are installed in a more difficult to access location (requires taking laptop apart). However, I was fairly easily able to install 2 16GB = 32 GB of additional ram in the two available slots. I used the crucial memeory (Ballistix Sport). Also note that the solid state drives are 2 x 128 GB which i find unfortunate because I had wanted to add a larger solid state drive but found the slots were both taken. Therefore to upgrade the size of the solid state drive or drives you have to image your hardrive somewhere and copy it over to a new drive. I understand you can install an Nvme (a faster solid state drive) but I haven't done this yet. Last thing, I had a brief issue with the sleep mode but I believe it was due to out of date drivers.
I really love this machine. I usually buy MSI products but this one seem much for geek oriented when it come to upgrading as it does not take someone with an engineering degree to do the simple things. Their GUI software utilities are good I only wish their BIOS screen was much more advanced like the MSI one is. Also, on the downside, I do not understand why they put a gaming computer SSDs in the RAID mode even if it is Raid 0. It is locked so as of last questioning of support you have to swap out the NVMe &/or M.2 and replace then to get rid of the Raid function which even a basic gamer like me could see that the speed tests were bottle necking there....also, support will tell you the max for the SSD cards is 512GB. That is not true as a simple Youtube search will show you that you can put a 1TB NVMe and 1TB M.2 in the machine and it works great and fast.Unfortunately though it worked right out of the box ..one of the spare Memory ports would not work, the mother board was not communicating with it. Finally had to send it back for a replacement....the saga continues and will update later on that.On the positive side, if you buy an acer be sure to join (its free) the ACER COMMUNITY. They had some great suggestions on seeing what the problem was and were able to come up with the much needed specs for the memory slots and what they are supposed to hold. shared that spec with Acer support as they did not seem to have those specs available.I dropped the rating by 1 star because of Acer's tech support...I should not have had to provide the memory slot specs for this unit to get them to double check and see that the memory slot should work.....also, they know they have a "pink" screen issue at boot up (annoying but not a biggy)...but mainly it was obvious after working a week with them much of their response was canned responses which I do not hold against them....Oh well, if you have an Acer again I highly recommend the Acer Community group.
In a word, 'WOW'!! What is not to love in this computer??The good:- It has a killer refresh rate- It starts up in seconds, literally. Not in minutes like my last laptop.- The keyboard has a very comfortable feel. Very responsive. Love how it's lighted.- The mouse is the very best that I have ever had on any laptop.- Love the fans that exhaust from the rear. Keeps your legs cool when actually using it as a 'lap' top.- The speakers are arranged in such a way that it mimics surround sound.- I love the removable DVD drive to replace with the extra fan. The designers really worked to keep this bad boy cool!- It looks very cool! When in use the lid has two lit up red lines with the Predator logo lit in red too.What some might consider 'the bad'.- It is a monster, in size. It is heavy and it is larger that the average 17.3" laptop. If you are getting, or have, a laptop bag (might want to consider a rolling one) it might not fit. I purchased on that was supposed to fit a 17.3 and it does not fit in the sleeve. I can get it, carefully, in the very rear of the bag but it is a glove fit.I do not mind the weight of this laptop. To be able to fit in all of the components that I wanted in my next laptop, it's going to have some weight.So far, I am very please with my purchase and it was worth every penny!!
I have used this computer for 3 months. I can only recommend this computer to someone that is skilled at computer repair!!!Pros:It plays games like PUBG, witcher 3 and Watch Dogs 2 with high/ultra settings at the screens refresh rate, which is 75Hz.Plenty of storage if you don't mind a little longer load times from the 7200 RPM hdd. Also storage is easily expanded.Not that hard to replace/upgrade ram.Opening up the computer is not complicated and I didn't see a single warranty void sticker.The battery times are better then advertised. With light use it has lasted ~4 hours to 20% remaining.BUT! It had several issues from the factory,Cons:It would freeze randomly! Total lock up that needed the power button held down to turn off. This went away only after I installed the latest version of the BIOS. This is not something to be taken lightly as you can brick the computer during this process if not careful.It is now stable with no crashes or other errors.The speakers create a noticeable rattle/buzz at certain frequency's. Its somewhere under the keyboard. I try not to use them much because of this. Not the biggest deal for me.It gets really hot. The factory thermal paste is not good. Too much and poor quality, as everyone knows. This is an ongoing issue for this computer. I have re-pasted the CPU and GPU with ARCTIC MX-4. Before I was getting up to 97c with heavy gaming quite quickly. Within ~30 mins. Now I still get up to 97c but much more slowly, about 4 hours. And with most games it only gets to about 83c. I plan on re-pasting again with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut.I also have the CPU under volted by .120 volts. I don't know if this is helping but there is no performance loss.It has a lower tier Windows 10.It serves my needs quite well but if I wasn't able to fix it it would have gone back within the first day.
Scary fast and wicked beautiful. I know looks aren't supposed to be a factor, but ... wow. the lid with the red lights behind the lines and the wolf motif, and the keyboard with all the colored lights behind it are gorgeous and very attention getting. It works great. The screen is enourmous and crystal clear. I haven't used the freezy insert for cooling yet, as I have a pretty good fan under it. I downloaded the manual, but haven't looked up yet how to actually use that. This thing is also big and heavy, really pushing the limits of what is portable. It is too large to fit into my existing laptop sleeve. Customer service from Acer is superb, as I had a little lockout issue early on that they resolved over the phone, no problem. Love all the ports for peripherals, my last laptop ran out of USB's after I added the mouse dongle and the fan. I love that I can toggle off and on the touchpad with just a button. Battery lasts me about 3 hours before it needs charging.
Seemed promising however Pink flash on boot up randomly and artifacting often during games not even a day of ownership and had massive issues, Ran VERY hot on CPU often idling between 50c-80c and getting to 97c+ while gaming with the frost core installed and max fan speed. On forums for this laptop it is well known and people are undervolting and repasting there CPU, However I feel I shouldn't have to undervolt and re-do the thermal paste on a brand new laptop.Final verdict: Returned.This is the laptop, around 10 seconds pay attention and you will see the pink flash that should not be there.
I love it. The packaging for shipment was superb. One would have thought they were shipping nitroglycerin. There were multiple boxes and protective cushioning. The laptop arrived safe and secure. Set up was easy for this tech challenged, non-geek. The system is amazingly fast, at least to me. It is quiter than I expected given the comments of other reviewers. The sound system is great for a laptop computer. I was expecting mediocre sound. I have only had it for a few weeks and am very pleased with my decision to buy it. There are so many choices out there, it can make one dizzy to finalize a decision among them. The unit is solid and feels well made. My only beef is the backlite key board. It is lite up like a Christmas tree with all the colors and from the seated viewing position the light shines from the sides of the keys rather brightly. But, no big deal for me. I do wish the Predator introduction screen with loud obnoxious noise could be eliminated. That gets old quickly.I'd recommend this system.
I freaking love this thing! Was soo excited when it got here works like a BEAST! Ran every game ultra rainbow six siege not even overlooked at 160fps!!!Just another edit here and Ive had this machine for about 2 and a half months now, I play Tom Clancys Rainbow Six Siege Ultra settings and PUBG Payday2 so far havent had any issues, I also stream on Youtube, Twitch, using OBS and all that and does not freeze plus I like the Ge-force experience pop up interface to record my games and such so far I Love it still and baby the sh*t out of it.
We had to purchase this item three times before we got one that worked. Laptop would hibernate and couldn't be waked up without rebooting and loosing our work. Acer help desk could not solve the problem, either. We finally developed a fix through several days of on line research. Once the machine works, it's a very nice dual-purpose machine.
A couple things to note that I wish was clear when I made this purchase myself:This laptop comes with 2 M2 drive bays and a 2.5 inch HDD. My laptop came with 2 128GB M2 SSD's. The SSD's can be upgraded/replaced independently, although you may have to remove RAID settings before it will recognize the SSD. Not removing RAID settings will make the SSD undetectable, but is an easy fix.The annoying BIOS startup sound can be disabled in the BIOS settings.Maybe it was just a mistake on my part, but despite being a 17-inch laptop, it does not fit in a 17 inch case or at least not the brand I purchased. An 18-inch case will work though..I have only had one instance where the keyboard stopped working entirely, requiring a force shutdown to resolve the issue. Other than that, no issues at all.
Great machine, easy setup and runs Tom Clancy's Wildlands flawlessly. Predator Sense tool allows for not only overclocking but monitoring of temps on CPU, GPU, etc. Replacing the DVD with a fan helps keep the machine cool so there's no heat on the keyboard.
Runs cool and quiet. Beautiful ips screen with outstanding viewing angles. Gtx 1070 gsync @ 1080p runs all my games locked at 75hrz with max settings including Witcher 3. All this at a price less than the competition with similar specs. Very happy with my purchase. I can only imagine that people having heat issues are blocking the vents when the unit is on their lap. I keep my Predator on a cooling pad all the time so it is getting proper air flow even when on my lap
I have had this laptop for about 5 months now and I have been very impressed. Mostly gaming with it, it has performed very, very well. The monitor looks fantastic, I don't find the LEDs to be annoying at all, the size works well for me, it stays cool, and it has been solid and reliable. I immediately replaced the hdd with a 500GB Samsung 860 evo that I had on hand and it's been perfect for me. I love it. This laptop is a beast and was a steal for the specs/features it has.
This thing is a beast. Performance wise, it's amazing. Weight wise, it isn't bad. It is a very sexy product. There is one down side, and that is that it was VERY hard to buy a laptop bag. They make a custom one for it, but its no longer available. I ended up going with a tactical hiking bag that I'll have to modify to get some padding around the main pouch.Great laptop though. I hope it is up to rigors of travel around the world!
So far, it works great. Fast with great graphics.
Despite the price dropping immediately after I purchased this laptop, I can't say I regret the purchase. I find it to be a beautiful piece of hardware, with a good build quality, which I believe should be a given with the price. While I haven't had the opportunity to take it through some heavy duty stuff, I have confidence that with these specs I will be okay. I won't bother with the specifications since they're listed multiple times, but I have to admit that this keyboard is very nice. Cheers!
Great performance for a reasonable price.
Giving 4 star for this device at the moment, only problem I have with it is, at very rare times get blue screen.Although I read up and found out that if you put different ram in it takes the problem away, have not tried it myself but for now extremely happy with this product.Yes it is super heavy just a warning to people buying it.
The product is really solid when it comes to gaming! However, there is a slight issue with the touchpad being extremely hot (85â?. Definitely recommend a cooling pad with this laptop.
I was worried at the beginning with this laptop, Acer is not one of my favorites companies but this computer is awesome, is really quiet and can run any game without problems, one of the things that was hard to me to find was the refresh rate of the screen but it is 75hz and the screen does have G-SYNC I can confirm that.
The description says it all this thing Is a beast. Remember this is a gaming laptop itâs big itâs definitely heavy and youâll need a special bag to put it in. I searched a lot of different laptops for a couple days and compared a lot of specs for the money and this predator won out on top and let me tell you I am not disappointed. Itâs very fast plays almost any game perfectly very minimal Bloatware and set up was very easy Iâm so glad that I got this laptop !!!!
It does everything that I want done quickly. No problems. I do not need to rely on the battery, therefore, I am unable to judge the battery.
Best computer I've ever had the pleasure of owning, super fast\reliable, can basically handle anything you throw at it. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something that's gonna last.
The computer is awesome. It is much bigger than the normal laptop but i love the cursor touch pad, it feels smooth. Also the keys are smooth and quiet. This is not a laptop to be carrying everywhere you since it is a little heavier than most but it is a awesome computer.
Within two weeks of having this it began randomly restarting while in the middle of any mildly intense task. Fortnite at 1080p 60fps with settings on Medium will consistently make it restart without warning. Absolute piece of trash. Was expecting significantly more from this. I will be sending it in to be serviced, but this has left a terrible taste in my mouth. Right now I have a very expensive internet browsering computer.
I love it! I This laptop runs fast and I am able to play games with ease! Only problem is that it's hard to find a protective cover because it's so thick and large.
i purchased this computer because i missed pc gaming so badly, and didnt want a desktop. this computer is amazing! play pub g on ultra over 60fps, and any other game you can think of on ultra. the monitor is great, keyboard kicks ass (and looks cool). yea its heavy and big, but what do you expect with a 17 inch gaming laptop with a 1070 in it??? highly recommend! if you can afford the 1080 why not?? i use this thing almost everyday.
I'm travelling a lot for work, so as a gamer of course my first priority was to buy myself a gaming laptop. After a couple of months of research, I realized that every laptop out there is always missing one key component whether it's the video card, SSD, display, cooling, etc. I finally picked this one because it seemed to have most of what I was looking for: A decent SSD, a 1070 video card (can't afford any higher), and good cooling (based on reviews).After a few months of using it, I'm very pleased with its performance. The Geforce 1070 is good enough to play every game I've thrown at it at 2k resolution w/DSR and G-Sync on. Some of the games I've played so far at almost max settings are Witcher 3, PUBG, Divinity:OS 2, Just Cause 3, and Rainbow Six:Siege. I haven't had any overheating issues, which is one of the biggest concerns for many gaming laptops.The 2 cons I've noticed are, as some other reviewers have mentioned:1. On 4 or 5 occasions, the laptop has gone into some sort of sleep mode and I couldn't bring it back up. I could hear the fans spinning at max capacity, but it requires me to turn the laptop off and on again. I've read similar issues like this one on their forums from other people.2. There is some backlight bleeding going on. On my laptop, it's on the right side of the screen. Only noticeable when displaying very dark or pitch black screens.Also, I'm not counting this as a con because it's just how it's built, but the laptop + power adapter is quite heavy. I bought the following backpack to carry it around:Everki Beacon Laptop Backpack with Gaming Console Sleeve, Fits up to 18-Inch (EKP117NBKCT) - So far, so good!I would recommend this laptop to those looking for something similar to the specs it carries.UPDATE: The Q/A section is filled with confusion regarding this model's monitor refresh rate. The monitor is G-Sync capable, and it's 75Hz.
An absolute piece of art , the spec and building quality pretty amazing .would recommend it over any other gaming laptop in the same price range .
Makes a really loud noise when it powers on and off. Annoying. But otherwise, great!
Not quite a month in and it is rock solid. Picking up Destiny 2 shortly so the real test is coming but so far...so GOOD!I feel like this is a step up from my experiences with Alienware tech.I could not be happier.
as expected very good
great gaming laptop! all the the specs more expensive competitors have at a fraction of the price. Its big, but who wants to game small?
Excellent computer. Solid build quality.Been looking for a computer like this one for a long time.Big and heavy like a gaming computer should be.Have not found a single thing that I dislike.
Bought for my son, primarily for gaming. He loves it.
So far no issues and stays nice in cool when gaming.
After long search i finally decided to purchase this monster it offers the best specs/price for this range , it should arrive soon and i will keep you updated.Best Wishes to allAcer Predator 17 Gaming Laptop, Core i7, GeForce GTX 1070, 17.3" Full HD G-SYNC, 16GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD, G9-793-79V5
Thus far, it's great. It can handle pretty much anything I've thrown at it. My only concern is that by its self it runs pretty hot. Now that I have a laptop cooler it's much better, but still. That's why I gave it 4 stars since that's a large problem
works great fastest laptop ive ever owned and performs at an alienware lvl at 1/3 the price
Satisfais de mon achat,j'ai changer mon hhd 1tb pour 1tb ssd,et jai ajouter 32gb de ram de meilleur qualiter tous se qui conserne la qualiter des composer systeme dorgine est cheap mes pour le prix de reventes des pieces pour des nouvelles en vos le coup
Awesome laptop, EXCEPT... the CPU runs around 85* Celsius on heavy load!!!!!
Very good laptop all the complaints I have read about overheating and bios issues I have yet to have any of these problems system runs very cool and quiet and that's after long gaming sessions. Would highly recommended this laptop!
Yes, I am very happy with this powerful laptop.
Awesome laptop!! Start up is super fast. Runs games with know issues!!
easy to put in a ssd in place of the hdd
Love it
Best $$$ I've spent on a laptop yet.
it's a great laptop, a little big and heavy but the functionality is perfect for the gamers and developers
I purchased my laptop about 8 months ago. It has a couple of huge issues. First, every once in a while it will stop responding to any keys. It has to be hard shut down using the pin hole on the bottom. This has happened about 3 times since purchasing the computer. The second issue is that one of the speakers makes a loud static noise when the laptop starts to get warm. It happens really fast when you do any kind of VR or play games. It is too loud to keep playing.Acer Customer Service is worse than these issues. The agents are really hard to understand and Acer will force you to ship your laptop to them, AT YOUR EXPENSE, so they can work on it.I will never buy anything from Acer ever again.
Acer did good
Excellent gaming machine, non-existant Linux support. This would have been a really great workstation if someone had invested a bit of time and effort in providing drivers for their platform for Linux. I didn't buy this for gaming though, I bought this to be my workstation. With a powerful 1070 GPU and the capacity for two M2 drives and a SATA drive, a 7th gen i7 and upto 64G of RAM, it makes a perfect high end portable developer machine.Dear Acer, it's almost 2018, get some official Linux support please. You replied back to my question of linux support by saying it's unreasonable to expect Linux support, and that I should use your community forums for help. I looked there, whenever anyone asks for Linux support, nobody answers and the question gets closed, so nobody can help. This is why I only gave 3 stars and not 5. It's barbaric to sell laptops in this day and age without providing Linux drivers and support.The keyboard is nice. Not mechanical Cherry Red keyswitch nice, but good enough - much better than the new zero travel keys on Macbooks. Good travel, a bit clicky, but not too much. The backlight is nice, but wish it was just white or red instead of rainbow colored. I suppose if Acer did support Linux properly they'd have drivers that let you set it differently...The case material however is bad. While it's sturdy, it collects fingerprints like you wouldn't believe. Have to constantly wipe it down. Both on the outside when the lid closed and on the inside and even the keys. Never had this issue with Apple, Lenovo, Dell or or other laptops.Good set of USB ports a nice USB C port (no, not for charging the laptop).I don't know how good the 2TB Seagate drive it came with is, it does run hot. I immediately replaced it with a 2TB SATA Samsung SSD instead.If you want to add a 2nd M2 drive know that the top M2 slot will require an adapter to install. It's physically too long and the SSD will swing in the wind with nothing to anchor it down otherwise. M2 adapters will not work right. I had to resort to tape to get it to work with an M2 adapter.While there is a security slot, the bay that contains the memory and SSDs is protected only by a thin plastic cover that is somewhat flimsy and is locked only by screws. It should have some kind of lock on it so someone can't flip your machine over and steal your RAM/disks.The core cooler that slides into the DVD slot is great. I haven't bothered with optical discs in quite some time, though it's nice to have the option, I'd rather have the extra fan that it provides, that was a good design decision.The BIOS is quite flaky. Had to disable secure UEFI and switch to legacy boot to get Ubuntu to work nicely with encrypted disks, though this is more of a Linux issue than a BIOS issue, however the signed EFI bootloaders for linux can be added, but the BIOS wasn't written by folks with skills in English, and it's quite confusing trying to figure out what the error messages were trying to convey.In the BIOS, you can mark an EFI boot file as trusted, but if you try to remove it and add it back in because you gave up on a previous OS install and wiped the disk, it will say it's already added and offer no way to remove it, and worse, it won't work because it's not from the same installation as when it was added! In the end I gave up in disgust and went with Legacy MBR boot. Shameful.What works: video (with nvidia drivers off their site), keyboard, trackpad. Left hand side macro keys do not work. acer-wmi prints "acer_wmi: Unknown function number - 7 - 1" in /var/log/syslog. Sound from the headphone jack. WiFi Bluetooth USB 3 and USB C ports Suspend Upgrading the RAM to the maximum of 64GWhat doesn't work: Speaker sound only comes out of the "subwoofer" which is somewhat on the left hand side. The front speakers do not show up at all. Even with the daily build of alsa daily, likely because acer-wmi needs updating. Closing the lid case does not cause the laptop to hibernate or sleep. Opening the case, however, does wake it. You have to use the power button before you close the lid! (Basically the lid switch acts as a keyboard HID but uses a non-standard keycode.) The screen will not dim. You can hack something up that uses xbacklight to dim the screen and that works. The backlight will not turn off when the notebook is locked. You'll get a black screen but you'll see the mouse pointer. To actually turn off the backlight and prevent shortening the life of the display you'll need to press FN+F6 after you lock the OS. Hibernate does not work. Takes a very long time to dump RAM to the disk, and then crashes the OS. Randomly, when waking from suspend, it wakes up without the keyboard connected, so you can't type your password to unlock it, though the mouse works. If you can put it to sleep and wake it up again, sometimes it comes back, or you can try to plug in an external keyboard and then the built in keyboard might come back - however, sometimes the power switch won't allow suspending when it when in this state (because the power switch is also an HID device that shows up as a type of keyboard) so you might need to hard power cycle it! When a new nvidia driver comes out, if you don't immediately reboot after installing it, suspending it and waking it will show a pinstripe screen and the OS will crash because the GPU crashed. /var/log/syslog will also show GPU warnings saying the kernel drivers are different for the GPU - this of course is an nvidia issue. You should not use the ubuntu provided nvidia drivers.I got it to work with Ubuntu 17.10 after much wrestling. 16.04.2 does not function well at all. The core issue is that acer-wmi doesn't fully support this machine.
Always had great luck with the predator line of laptops. Two for two. No issues. Great product.
good and im happy thank amazon thanks acer
It does everything
Out of box stressed tested CPU runs at 95C on a full load. Undervolted still running at 88C hitting 93c gamingUpdate- got my 2nd laptop in same issues but worse hits 98-100c while gaming. Love everything about this laptop but people at the factory do not know how to apply themral paste apperntly. I'm debating trying a 3rd unit but this one does a hard freeze 3 to 4 times a gaming session.
Satisfied with the purchase. Screen, speakers, keyboard, they are all top-notch. Great materials and build. But most importantly, CPU and GPU (GTX 1070) performance is excellent. The fan does get loud at times, but not that bad in my opinion.
I like the laptop, works perfectly. Everything is great except Bass.I think Acer must increase bass (Sub-Woofer). If you are listening song on 100% Volume then you feel bass (Sub-Woofer) otherwise it is just a simple speaker like other Laptops.One more thing Laptop comes with Windows 10 HOME#Update: They should change Laptop Bass Volume (Sub-Woofer)
Performs great. No lag time. Great graphics.
It's bad. I bought this computer in order to play the game, but constantly blue screen. And then open the battlegrounds, now the sound is gone, I do not know how to deal with this computer
I purchased the Acer Predator 17 Gaming Laptop, 17.3" Ultra HD G-SYNC, Core i7, NVIDIA GeForce GTX1070, 32GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, 2TB HDD, G9-793-70DL. I need drive speed for recording high speed astrophotography video cameras (300++fps with other things going on at the same time) and have spent 3 days trying to get a Samsung 512gb 960 Pro nvme m.2 to even be SEEN by the Predator in any slot. BTW it goes in the first slot (slot 0 is the correct slot for nvme - IF it were there at all due to lack of ability to set to AHCI in BIOS). As as aside, the original 256gb SSD works fine in slot 1 with the OS on it, is B and M keyed and only a SATA).Despite numerous calls to Acer, the best they could do was direct me to the innumerable and uninterpretable forum posts on this exact topic. Horrible lack of tech knowledge at Acer CS. While I'm not an IT guy any more, I tried all of the forum solutions other than the multi-page Rube Goldberg suggested regedit changes just to get what it was supposed to have when I bought it (note their use of PCIe in the description of the SSD without clarifying that it is ONLY SATA capable is shameful).Anyway, after I pulled the power bar while it was running and had it go black (something is wrong with ability to recognize a fully charged battery that even the 'paper-clip reset' suggestion from their tech support didn't fix) I am about to return it after days of loading software and messing with the BIOS. I am already back to looking at over-priced MSi's. Bottom line, it is poor form at best to sell a $2-3k high-end gaming machine with some Fischer-Price BIOS locked on old tech. Time is money and for the headaches I have had for 3 days of reading and re-boots, they should send me a check for $2 or 3K just to keep it.I'm willing to try once again if anyone has a solution as to how to change modes to AHCI in BIOS other than waiting for them to update the BIOS. I see posts in their forums dating back 2 years for people 'waiting' for this, I'm too old to wait 2 more and gosh I would be grateful for some competent help!!!
beast in performance.
Iâve had problem after problem with mine
First glance: Just unpacked. Will continue to update.Pros:Fast, really, really fast. For the price...ouch. wow.No duhs:Heavy: It's a beast... to be expected. Actually not as ugly as I was expecting. Frankly if I figure out how to zero out the led it's really not bad looking.Cons:Keyboard: clunky. Maybe I'll get used to it.Trackpad/right/left click: HOW ON EARTH DID THIS HAPPEN?????? CLEARLY the engineers are mouse users and have NEVER used a trackpad. Horrible. But what do gamers care? Well. I do. It's not just a gaming platform. I almost never game, just want a good platform when I do. Going to write my next business plan this week and do a bit of research on the flight overseas in two days. This track pad is, harumph, horrible. Untenable really. A shame. After 30 years of laptop engineerings and to find this...on this machine. Wow. Like putting fun back into complaining.Thoughts.Hope the HUGE transformer has enough juice on the planes outlet to power this dragon. I'm really excited to provide more positive feed back and hope to find a way to shut that horrible start up sound down. And hate the trackpad/buttons less. On the whole, great price for a potentially obnoxiously fast machine that I pray will meet my needs/desires for success in both business IRL and GOL.Throw me a question and I'll try to answer it.
Computer has trouble regaining consciousness after going to sleep.Puzzled, it is only a few weeks old.Also there was a small chip in the laptop case that really I would notice but it makes me wonder, naturally.
The build quality of this machine is first rate. The sound is great, the screen is great, really great. This is the standard screen that I am referring too. I know there are higher resolution options but I donât think my eyes could detect any higher resolution. Itâs gorgeous.The Bad:The NVIDIA 1070 is putting out 20 FPS out of the box. You must update the drivers.If you are not an experienced computer user you will find there are a ton of drivers to update and YOU have to sort it out.ACER tech support is no help. They suggested I check for answers elsewhere but told me I was welcome to call back.I managed but I thought ACER should have taken more of an interest in my problem.Also there are messages that pop up from Acer periodically that I believe concern the setup process but they donât stay on the screen long enough to read them.
Item arrived dead in box.
1. This laptop has some sh*tty thermal paste, so the cpu temperature hits 50C Idle and 95C at full load, but if I repaste it on my own, I'm pretty sure they'll void the warranty.2. Hello Acer ! it is a gaming laptop, not a toaster... The bios is almost unusable, all features are locked and hidden except boot menu. I can understand if they hide voltage and frequency control features as they can physically damage the device, but they have hidden such features as hyperthreading, VT-D, VT-X. You can't switch between intel integrated and Nvidia video cards. Also there is no power consumption preset feature in bios as in Predatorsense, so I can't use it from other operating systems like linux.3. Battery dies in 2 hours just by web browsing, probably because of high cpu temperature.4. All other parts - gpu, ram, hdd, display, keyboard, touchpad, webcam, dvd drive, io ports works fine.And finally, this means that Acer treats us as if we were some stupid kids and we don't need advanced features in bios, which makes this laptop unusable for professional programmers and artificial intelligence researchers like me.******* U P D A T E ***********Warning ! disassembly may void your warranty.I disassembled my laptop and applied new thermal paste Arctic MX-4. After repasting, CPU temperature dropped from 96C to 74C (when only cpu was used)but when both CPU and GPU are utilized at 100%, CPU gets 98C and GPU gets 90C.you can see on screenshots1. Before repasting (only cpu utilization 100%)2. After repasting (only cpu utilization 100%)3. After repasting, both cpu and gpu utilization 100% while playing Battlefield 1.
It's Terrible. Nothing but BSOD
When you setup the laptop, the wifi is a little unstable. But after few hours its just the smoothest thing ever. Love it
This is a gaming laptop that cannot play games. Yes the stats are great, and the screen is beautiful, however in the 4 days ive owned this thing i cannot play a single game without a BSOD. Ive had about 25-30 so far and about 10 different varieties. I let windows do its updates, ive updated every single driver, ran memory and hard disk checks, tried everything from the forums on how to fix these and they still persist. Every game ive tried blue screens between 1 and 10 minutes in. Ive done fresh installs on the games, tried installing on both drives. tried changing the settings, running in 32 bit, and the end is still the same. After the crap I went through even getting this thing after amazon sent me a box of exhaust parts instead of the computer and then spent 3 weeks delaying my refund only to act like i did something wrong and then finally give me a refund after hinting that they still didnt believe me I had hoped my problems were finally over and i would have an awesome gaming machine...nope. I basically have a $1600 tablet because all I can do is surf the internet and check emails. I am so disappointed with this purchase. My old $500 acer with a 940mx works far better than this fancy brick.
Very good machine. I'm not a huge gamer, but do a lot with music and production of music, plus graphic arts. This PC has taken everything I could throw at it in terms of editing and elrecording and barely uses any system resources. Screen clarity and quality is great, especially compared to higher priced MSI computers. Bright and vibrant. Built in speakers are not the greatest, especially when they are aimed at your stomach/chest most the time. Would strongly suggest adding the Predator Accessory kit to your cart if your buying this laptop. You get a ton of power and performance in a very inexpensive machine.
If someone told me I would be buying a laptop let alone gaming on one a couple years ago I would have laughed at them.The Acer predator with the 1070 is an absolute beast at 1500. Plays anything I want at max, keeps cool, and is mobile. I don't know if I'll ever have a desktop again.I was extremely happy with it and then I spilled about a cup of water on the keyboard while it was running. The screen went gray and my first thought was well I guess I get to buy the newer model. I lifted it up and water poured out the usb ports the keyboard and the touch pad. I left it sit overnight and the thing turned on like nothing happened. The touch pad didn't work for about a week now it's all back to normal.Buy this laptop. You will not regret it.The only negative is the solid state came as 2 128 in raid 0 and the raid failed. I ended up buying a 512 and calling it good.
It's a very gaming laptop. Coming from a alienware 17 r4 it feels like a downgrade though. The keyboard and build are not as strong. Also the bios is pretty bare bones not many options at all like on the alienware. Maybe 2-3 setting you can change compared with like 20 on the alienware. Mine did have g-sync but that also means no intel graphics so battery life is pretty bad. I get around 2hr with my alienware I used to get 3hr though it had the 99whr battery much bigger than the one on this laptop.Positives are the sound is better keyboard and build are not that bad. Overall if you can get at a decent price it's a soild buy. Has 4 ram slots so can support 64gb ram also you can swap out the 1080p screen for a 4k screen like I did if you want. just don't expect to be able to game in 4k but it's great for 1080p gaming and 4k video streaming.
Love this laptop. If you guys are trying to find a carrying case or bag for this laptop. Try looking for a orben backpack. I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $30.
Nice computer, hard to find a carrying case/ bag to fit 17.3", even the Acer Predator bag is too snug.
Loved it. Just what I expected
A solidly built, fast computer I use for photo editing.
I facilitated this purchase, for an undergrad. Fantastic computer, for the price. It's very hard to go wrong, with Lenovo.
Mine just came in today. My other laptop died and I was in need of one ASAP, so I figured I don't have much to lose with one for $245.It is very lightweight and sleek looking. Pretty fast considering it's not top of the line.If I encounter a problem, I will update this but so far so good. Really happy with this buy.
This laptop was a replacement for a Toshiba Intel i5 / 2.67GHz, 4GB RAM, used to render 1080 videos (using Sony Vegas video suite).Good: The Lenovo renders at a similar speed. Functional DVD/CD R/W. Display is average. It wasn't loaded with too much "junk" trial software.That said, it's an odd design with shortcomings that will matter depending on your usage.Fair: You can't add memory or change the battery. It's difficult to open--there is no indent or other affordance to make it easy to grip.Poor:1. The external power comes from a "wall wart" with a 6 foot cable, barely reaching across a desktop when the outlet is on the wall.2. The DC power plug will fit into the audio jack--may cause damage or visa-versa.3. All connector labels are nearly impossible to read (need light & magnifier).QUIRKY DESIGN FLAWS--TWO STAR PENALTY:1. This is the first "non-standard" keyboard i've seen. The RIGHT SHIFT key is 1/2 size, the other half is PAGE UP--SUPER ANNOYING if you need to do some typing.2. The SD card reader (once you locate it!) takes the card contacts up (flip from normal) and doesn't have a "latch" feel when seated. Contacts down (normal on most laptops) doesn't give resistance when you plug it in. Also, this quirk is NOT IN THE MANUAL!!
I think this is a very good laptop for the price. I especially like that it has a CD drive. It is easier for me to upload all my "older" programs with a CD. It runs fairly fast with my WiFi. This is a good second computer.
Will recommend to friends.
I don't do much with the laptop except online classes and browse the internet, but this laptop is slow and cheap feeling. Even though I have the settings set to not allow the web cam on, every few minutes my security sytem blocks the web cam from coming on. I don't recommend it.
It is Lenovo's consumer grade product. If your budget is low it is better than the HP or Dell equivalent. If you can spare the money do move up to the Thinkpad series. .
I got hyped up reading the specs. But not that its in my hands. It SO SLOW. Maybe its just me. Its a good laptop its just TO SLOW for me maybe. They shoulda made it bend 360 instead of strait upwards
I liked the 500 GB hard drive , great screen resolution, DVD drive.This computer is fast enough for my needs. I do not play high end video games. I would have liked another sub port.
If you want a FAST pc, buy something else, but for a basic workhorse, you can't beat the value
Purchased for my Mother-in-law, whom I like, She loves it.
Bought it for office work and some light media streaming at home. Laptop looks sleek as heck. Did alright with the media streaming, but horribly slow when it came to running programs like Excel. Ultimately the reason I returned it.
This is my second Lenovo and it does not disappoint. The only thing I don't like about it is the placement of the right hand shift key. To save space on the keyboard, they put this shift key to the right of the page up key. I have short fingers and small hands, so this makes it difficult for me to reach the right shift key.
Very happy with seller and item
I was trying to return in order to get a more expensive for my daughter but as I din't have the chance of returning it on time I am very happy because it is perfect for me very ligth weight and what I real need it.
My son can't put it down
Excelent product !!!
i love it but i didnt know Microsoft office was only a trial
The computer is not working after four weeks.
I really like my laptop.
The laptop was very slow, and after having less than a month issues started. The mouse pad stopped working and when I went to control panel it showed symbol that my laptop needed trouble shooting and it was saying my driver was inactive. I'm not sure what is wrong with it. I don't recommend it for the money I clicked to return it, I factory reset computer and just packed it in its original packing sending it back to get a different laptop. I need one for school I'm a full time student and this computer not working obviously isn't good enough. I'm not happy.
no slow and hard to deal with.
Es muy lenta
JUNK. Slow is an understatement. not even good enough to run multiple Google web browser pages. Don't waste your time or money.
I think this is a pretty good computer for the price. It is good for basic functions like browsing the internet or if you just want to use Windows or Word to write with. It has a DVD/CD drive also. Good computer for the price for basic use. Battery does not last too long.
SOOOOOO slowwwwwww. Should not be shipped with 'only' 4GB of RAM. I plan on updating the RAM to max (which I think is 8GB) to see what difference that makes and will update this review with results.
The computer is very slow and does not work well with multiple apps running. Mousepad has issues with sensitivity and my pad stopped working totally after two months of use.
It's been about two months since I've had this laptop and I feel like I've had enough time learning and reviewing it so heres my review:Pros:- i7-7700 HQ Quadcore CPU up to 3.8ghz- Nvidia 1050ti with 4GB DDR5- Both an SSD and HDD (Although you can always add these yourselves, it was nice to have come with both)- Cooling system is one of the best Ive seen so far (Includes an Ultra-Boost button to give you extra cooling, but never needed to use it.)- Fan disperses air away from the back screen of the laptop, rather than the side of the keyboard. (I prefer this design better)- Red Backlit keyboard (Color cant be changed, but I wasnt specifically looking for a flashy laptop so this is just a plus)- Overall Matte Black texture around the laptop with pleasing MSI dragon logo on the back screen.- AntiGlare Screen- Num. Pad keyboard- Comes with 1 year manufacturer warranty(US) (You'll have to activate it online yourself.)Cons:- Although aesthetically pleasing, the Matte Black Plastic Finish is a FINGERPRINT/OIL magnet and takes more than just a dry cloth to remove- 8GB RAM (I intend to add on another 8GB stick in the nearby future)- Battery life is ridiculous when playing games- Fans are REALLY loud when playing games (Not much of a problem if you wear headphones, and is expected as it does a splendid job keeping the laptop cool)- Speakers are subpar (Again, not much of a problem if you wear headphones)Overall, I was in the market specifically for a laptop that had a good CPU/GPU, and both an SSD and HDD. I stumbled upon many competitor laptops along the same price range however, some were missing an SSD or HDD, or had the regular 1050 GPU which comes with only half (2GB) of dedicated memory of what the Ti model has (4GB). If I had purchased those laptops instead, and added on a separate SSD OR HDD, the total cost spent would be above $1000. The laptop is surprisingly light for a gaming laptop, and comes in a sleek yet aggressive theme, which wasn't what I was in the market for but is a plus to me. Most people who game on laptops would know that you get better frames while plugged in to the charger (This is due to bottlenecking of either the CPU or GPU demanding more power, yet the battery cannot provide that power alone), so the low gaming battery life is not much of a problem considering you should be plugged in to get the best performance, and the battery life outside of gaming is average (4-6 hours) depending on what work you'll be doing. Ultimately, the laptop met more than my needs and was in my price range ($899, $960~ after taxes), and I expect to be using it throughout and well after the years of college.
Great laptop. I played overwatch a lot on console and wanted to switch to pc. I was worried about frame rate drops and ugly graphics. But im running overwatch on Ultra settings and frames never dropping below 70 runs smooth as silk. Very happy!
Bought this PC a little less than 3 months ago after my Acer laptop of 8-9 years started deteriorating too much. Was waiting to post a review til I've used it a bit.It's been good on most fronts -- runs games pretty fast, and everything has mostly been running quickly. Some downsides are the fans get quite loud sometimes (but when wearing headphones, you won't notice it as much) and the whole PC also tends to get very hot, including the keys.After these little less than 3 months, I've now encountered a random issue of one of the keys -- the 'o' key -- not working well at all. It has to be forcefully pushed down for it to register, and sometimes doesn't work unless I've pushed it really hard several times over. I have no idea why it's been doing this; I've been very careful with the computer and have never spilled anything or got anything stuck in the keys. I'm going to have it checked out soon, but with seeing more reviews on here also noting keyboard issues and other online reviews saying the same, I'm thinking it may be a more common MSI issue, which is rather upsetting. I hope I can get it settled soon, because it's otherwise been a nice computer.Edit: Also, I noticed someone on here noted that you have to buy a license to use the webcam, but that is not true. All you need to do is remove the app that is installed for the specialty webcam that you have to pay for, and use the regular webcam that does not require you to pay anything and works like a normal webcam should. That had an easy solution.
Honestly this laptop does me wonders. I play all of my games very smoothly and I only got this laptop for $900. The keyboard feels great, the backlit keyboard is awesome. Fast start up with windows being on the SSD while I could install my games on the hybrid disc. Honestly, if you're looking to buy a laptop well under $1000, this is a pretty good choice. If you want to upgrade to 16GB of RAM, you could do it easy.
Fast, keyboard feels wonderful, as a basic gaming machine it does what I need at a price I can tack. I use it mainly to run multiple photo editting software, photoshop, ACDsee, some canon software and i like to run all at the same time. The processing power and graphic card is making that a breeze. I specialize in making pano's and merged photos for proper exposure and wanted a laptop that could do it without getting bogged down. This has it. Really fast, i can put together 15 raw photos (30mb size each) and while it's processing the photos still be processing batches of basic edits on my other software while I'm surfing the web and do it all with no glitches and it's fast. The flat, non glossy screen is doing a great job and showing me the correct colors also. Used the laptop to edit one set and then transferred my drive to my main calibrated monitor and was very pleased how accurate the match was. Excellent for a laptop monitor. I'll be satisfied to use the screen for such in a pinch to do quick edits and not worry I've made something nuclear or drab.
My background: I'm a college student, so I use it for schoolwork and games sometimes. I never had a gaming laptop before.I've had it for a month now; I got it for $200 off, which is a great deal, though I would not recommend buying it for full price; from what I read, there are better laptops for the price range. It has a lot of useful features, like the cooling boost and shift. I'm not a fan of the default colors on the monitor; it looks too white, but I turned up the contrast so it looks better. The audio on the laptop isn't too good either, but I usually use headphones so it evens out. The speakers are also closest towards you on the bottom, though the laptop slants down anyways so the design seems pointless.As for gaming, I mostly use it to play League of Legends, which I can run at max settings and have it perform perfectly, which is great! Fortnite is the other demanding game I play, which runs at 75% max settings; still works and looks great. Everything else is on Steam and isn't that demanding, like Age of Empires 2.The laptop feels pretty sturdy for transportation, which is good when I take it to the library to study. The touchpad is slightly to the left, so sometimes my left hand will drag the cursor down the screen a bit or jump to a different part of a paragraph, which can be annoying while writing a paper. It has a fast startup time. The screen itself reduces glares a lot and makes it easy to see in bright areas; I've never had to turn the brightness above 30%Overall I'm satisfied with it.
So far i've enjoyed this laptop,ever since alienware sold their soul to dell,i've used majority of MSI products.I've use their motherboard to build my own desktop,and decided i needed laptop for school(i do use it for school purposes......occasionally hahaha).The keyboard lights is something i've always liked due to the fact i stay up late playing games or doing work,haven't tested the camera yet so i'm unable to give my opinion about it.Video card seems pretty awesome for it's 4g size,i've had no issues playing games like final fantasy 14,league of legends,total war:warhammer 2.The graphics are flawless.Love the anti-glare screen,freaking magical cause it's always been a issue of mine when playing during the day.The laptop case is neat,just notice don't touch any oily or greasey cause it'll leave marks but they are easily wiped away.The cooling fans work perfectly,laptop never really gets too hot unless i'm balls to the walls gaming,notice it does get kinda loud but it's expect when you're trying to keep something like this cool.Something that caught me by surprise was lack of cd-rom slot,now this is my first time owning a ultra light notebook so i guess that's a standard thing since the industary is going away with cds and moving to downloads/cloudservers.dragon center is a really cool app to keep track of the usage and temp of the laptop,but all around i believe this is worth the price i paid.
Mine came last week. i7-7700HQ Nvidia 4GB gtx 1050ti 8GB RAM128GB SSD(Windows 10 & Recovery)1TB HDI installed my Steam, Discord and I've been pewpew(playin) The Division. 60+ fps easily on low to medium gfx settings. High might drop to 30-60fps. I'm currently dl'n(downloading) Deus Ex Mankind Divided from my Steam library. This was such an awesome deal. I had to jump on it to replace my old dinosaur- 2010 Asus K53E-BBR9 with Intel HD 3000 which played what it could and I threw a lot of games at it until I started to get render issues and black screen of death with Insurgency. So yeah my new MSI is an excellent upgrade to handle all 100+ games in my steam library, Origin and Uplay.
This laptop is an amazing value. I am extremely pleased that I purchased this.Gaming: I have been playing Total War Rome 2 on ultra settings smoothly; it runs GTA V and Skyrim maxed out too. Recently I got into Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, which is gorgeous on this laptop.Work: I am also a college student, and this machine is amazing for that too. Its start up time and loading time for everything is very fast, the keyboard is crisp and responsive, and the keyboard lights up in case you need to work at night with no additional lights.Cons: when not plugged in the battery life is not amazing, maybe about ~2-2.5 hours typing a paper while listening to YouTube, but not terribly short.Overall: 5/5, would highly recommend.
Bought this as a second gaming pc for my daughter to play MMORPGs with me. Inexpensive, uncomplicated, and ready to go in an hour. Love it. No problems so far.
So far so good. A lot of updates and over a fast connection approximately 3 hours of initial install. Backup recovery takes awhile too. Some bloat ware to remove. Easy to get fingerprints on keyboard area. Since HD is a hybrid really have to be careful about where to install/load data. The master OS will be full pretty quickly so remove old windows install files ASAP.Runs good but highly recommended adding the 8 ram from the start. Remember there is a screw under tape in middle when open back. Easy to remove and upgrade other than that.Will update once my songames on it. Itâs a birthday gift. Set it up so he wouldnât have too. I do know runs PUBG and overwatch well.
Adding photos later, but here is my initial review.Unboxing, super easy and secure.Gaming runs smooth for low res since I mainly game on ps4, but for designing, these are the concerns.AutoCAD - efficient and no issues except large 3D architecture structures give some lag when rendering. Easy fix with larger SSD and 8gb more ram most likely for these issues.AutoDesk Maya - Rigs are smooth to place in Morrison Builder without lag, but the special effects of rain, snow, ice and such that I've coded and composed still gives lag. It doesn't freeze entirely like my old PC did. Turbo ran it efficiently for the testing that I needed at least.Photoshop - lags with brush sizes larger than 50pt. The display is purely impressive for me to customize 8K pictures. Very nice colour, tone and depth in the visual display. Also antiglare.Sony Soundforge - Does not have bass. Needs a sub or use bluetooth( not told in details about) to sync up a sub speaker or the aux port( mic port available too).Sony Vegas Pro - Converting Camtasia files and editing takes not too long for 1080p. A 4 hour stream I clipped to 12 minutes only took maybe 35 minutes to go to the highlights and editing and a 4-ten minute to finalize and convert.OBS - So, some of these may be because of the bandwidth for streaming. Currently the stream played flawless for my Intro, AFK Screen and Outro. During the stream, there was some latency issues with mic and video not syncing, but no issues with the black screen or pixelation.Gamers.Runescape and League of Legends run flawless on max settings.Perfect World, Forsaken world, Shaiya, Rusty Hearts, NeverWinter are at 60fps+ at 73% of settings maxed.Guild Wars 2, World of Warcraft, EVE and Dead by Daylight Run 60fps+ at 45-53% Of settings maxed.Fortnite, Darwin Project, PubG, Paladins Battlegrounds, H1Z1 and Ark all ran at max settings at 30fps+ without dropping. If moving to 60fps, I'd recommend upgrading ram and install on SSD instead of HDD, Wired (LAN), increasing RAM. At that point it should run close to 60fps flawless. I would recommend running these at minimum except distance for best results of competitive play.Now for the Housing.Compact, medium weight, finger print prone, dust magnet-not, easy to clean, upgrade, downgrade, and integrated with the following.Rj45 port,3.5mm jacks(2), 1 HDMI port, 1 port that I think is a female type C?, USB 3.0(2) USB 2.0(1). With MSI motherboards you can overclock the CPU, GPU, HDD Data transfers and USB ports.
I love this laptop I've been trying to switch to PC Gaming for a while now but didn't waht to have a big rig Only able to be set stationary at a single location so decided a Gaming laptop was the Best for Me since I do a lot of traveling and I live this things it's worked wonderful for the period of time that I've owned it for which is a whole month and I haven't really even felt the urge to start even playing on my Xbox one and not very many thing can do that as I am a console gamer at heart and this laptop has really been great being able to use it where ever I ho
So Iâve had this just about 3 weeks , I love it!!! Do yourself a favor get the 1050ti it really boosts this laptop. The ssd makes this thing boot up really fast and smooth, the i7 is new to me I use amd Iâm very impressed with it. Gaming on this thing is nice I havenât found anything that wonât run ultra Iâm sure there is some but not many. I also just got into video editing and this really does a great job at it. The turbo boost fan keeps this running cold. Overall Iâm in love with this laptop itâs lightweight battery if not gaming goes about 4 hours a little less gaming maybe a 1 hour time.
Love this laptop!!! I use it as a trading station and for any gaming with my kids. It's nicely priced, and truly is a beast with an overall small weight. Only critique is it does show hand/fingerprints so you do need to clean it occasionally or it looks like a giant smudge.
Just an incredible machine. I don't get impressed often but this device definitely made the cut. I had never heard of MSI before when I purchased it I just searched Amazon for gaming laptop and this was one of the results. The other day I just saw them advertised in Walmart. At any rate I'm glad I took the chance on this brand and this device. MSI is definitely going to be my go-to brand for computers from now on.
I am a mild gamer. 1 hour a day. but i test a lot of operating systems. mainly linux. so i can talk more on the multi-tasking part of the laptop more than i can the gaming part. using vbox this laptop can run two linux os plus windows very good. will not hickup . hard to run linux on the machine its self. tried multiple times and failed. still researching this problem. but all-in-all its a great laptop for the price.and its upgradable to 32gb ram .
Keyboard came defective and completely stopped working shortly thereafter. The MSI recommended troubleshooting failed, and then they recommended a bootstick (which I had to pay for), to fix the problem. Ordered the bootstick, but they waited a full day to actually ship it even though I paid for expedited shipping.And this was to replace the first laptop I purchased from them. In that laptop, the power supply failed 2 months out of warranty (a little over a year after purchase).DO NOT BUY MSI. They don't stand by their products, and they have no interest in actually helping their customers.
Best Purchase I've ever had.. -MSI GL62M 7REX 1050tiSold my acer predator helios 300 due to its shit screen even it's IPS but this msi model is just dominating over it.PROS:-bright screen AF even daylight I can play it-booting is so smooth-not noisy fan as other reviewers says-cooling fan is a big + never gave me too much heat playing dota2 and pubg with 65-75C temp-keyboard is epic-matt coloredCONS:- need to uninstall norton as it sucks a lot of my net speed- some bloatwares has to be removed-128gb ssd is not enough- need to completely reformat to have clean OS thats why I gave 4 stars.OVERALL:this laptop is recommended!
beastly laptop. i love this thing. great price/quality ratio
I needed a computer to replace my old one. As a photographer this runs my Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom smoothly and doesn't come with large amounts of bloatware. Perfect.
Got a couple of these for my gamer kids to replace giant power sucking ex-servers they were using. Really makes a difference in power consumption overall. They run well stable, kids like em. Reasonable deal for what you get- not the most uber powerful rig but fine for casual domination of the galaxy.
Second MSI I have purchased. I am a true believer in these machines. Well built, well priced, and a monster at gaming. Benchmarks very will, not even just as a laptop. but a PC.
The laptop works just fine, but it hasnât been long since I bought it and a part from behind the laptop just popped open. Iâm so disappointed, it was so expensive and not even sure what to do, I canât ship it back since I had it brought from the US to my country... pictures attached
Best thing I've ever bought on amazon. Beats the crap out of my friend's gaming DESKTOP he built for the same price.
Keyboard was unresponsive 20% of the time I clicked. I have returned for a refund. Update: Return finally accepted, now the darn Laptop has increased in price so my plan to re-order has been thwarted. Thanks MSI for nothing....
I have owned this computer now for a few weeks. Itâs performances is top notch. Awesome graphics and great for gaming. Only negative is that I wish I had a larger ssd drive. But Is something you can upgrade down the road. Same with the ram. Laptop is high quality. Would recommend especially for the price.
Happy with it so far. The only thing I donât like is that itâs a complete fingerprint magnet. Iâve BARELY touched the top yet itâs completely covered in smudges. The only other thing is that the fans can be pretty loud at times
This is a very good laptop pc used for gaming. Since it's my first I do not have much to compare it to, but mostly everything satisfies me.Good:It runs very quick with today's modern games. From GTA V to Cities Skylines, I have no complains to how it runs. The bootup is also good, only takes a couple of seconds. Screen is ok too with displaying colors, again, nothing to complain about. The best part is the service. The first laptop that arrived was defective. The screen was fuzzy upon startup so I needed to return it. After contacting Amazon they had me return it. The problem was that meant I was out of a laptop for a few days. However, they allowed me to purchase another laptop and wait for that one to arrive before I returned the other one.Bad:It's very loud, especially when you play high demanding games. This is good since the computer won't fry, but headphones are almost a must. The battery life isn't all that good even when I'm not running games, maybe a couple hours tops. It smudges easily by fingerprints all around also. It is kind of heavy and thick, which may serve as a problem for those wanting to fit in a lot of cases.Verdictit is a great choice for someone who needs a portable laptop that wants to play games for a low price. While one can build a PC for cheaper, this comes in handy for the college market.P.S. I made this review after having the laptop for a few months.
This computer is a beast.If anyone needs a computer that can run overwatch at high settings with almost 80 fps, this is for you. I'm sure turning stuff down will make the frames higher. After coming from a computer that ran on the lowest settings at 20 fps, this is amazing.The fan is an amazing detail on it. It'll cool the computer down immediately. So t hats a huge plus. Also the matte screen is a blessing too. From a person who wears glasses it's perfect. You don't get the extra glare from the screen.
The computer was nice but the battery is faulty. I don't know if I just got a bad batch but the battery wouldn't even last for one movie. I don't see the point in having a laptop that I have to keep plugged in the entire time. I would recommend splurging for the next level up on this computer.
Love it! Little noisy but plays games in very high quality.
This laptop, out of the box, trumps my 3yo desktop, that I so lovingly built.It has some issues. Namely, it runs hot.Get a cooling stand. Don't expect to use this on battery power for more than an hour. Way less if you do something graphics intensive. This is, for all intents and purposes, a portable lower end gaming desktop. The specs are really great for a mid-range gaming laptop. It's run everything I've thrown at it, and it's heaven benchmark on extreme was around 1200.It's a great, very light weight machine. It's so power hungry though. If you need portable, but always have the ability to plug in, this is exactly what you need.I'd invest in a bag for a 17 inch laptop however, because it's still larger than a standard 15.6"
Great power and performance for the price. It's get's a little warm, but the cooling pad I have underneath keeps things in check. It's plays Overwatch and my other favorites on full settings without any flaws. Love this thing!
Love this laptop. I will agree that the material used to make the case is an oil magnet, but that's definitely something a little windex and rag can fix. Performance wise this computer is great though. It's handled every game I've thrown it's way, and even lived through the cat walking across it. Just a small complaint about the MSI App not working in the slightest. Rather irritating but I guess i'll live. I also came to the realization that this laptop is infact VR ready!!!
runs PUBG on high on 60FPS, ultra on 49FPSruns CSGO on the highest option on 135FPSreaaaaalllyyyyyy strong. awesome. thin, light, very strong. its screen is a bit cheap, and i've had better batteries, but it fine for the price.i love this laptop. highly recommended.very strong, gaming capability ready, light, thin, nice looking, ssd+hdd..it is the best laptop for the price. for sure.
Awesome laptop but the battery life is very i mean very bad doesnt even last me 1 hour and while i game is like less than 30 minutes or even when am making music on FL studio jesus. Overall good laptop just that the battery is bad as they say or else i would give 5 stars.
This thing is incredibly fast. I have had no issues. I use it primarily to run a DAW (FL Studio 12). It loads my zipped FLP files in seconds and processes everything with ease. I also play Fortnite at medium settings with around 100 FPS.
Great item, that is as quick and concise as advertised. Fan is a bit loud when graphics are turned up, though else wise is a dream.
Very good! It came 3 days early, its fast. It downloaded all of my games in only 10 mins! I was on a 1000 budget and looked around forever until I found this beauty. The only bad thing I have found so far is the fact of the battery, it doesn't last that long but it is average. Still, if you want a fast and amazing computer get this one.
Great performance at a good price. I use it daily for both gaming and streaming and it has been able to handle everything I do. Would recommend the larger SSD since they tend to fill up quite quickly.
The best first gaming laptop , the only downside is the body is made of a "fingerprint magnet" plastic and it might feel a bit cheap but for the price and the specs is really good.
Love the quality of this laptop and for a very reasonable price! Only con is the battery doesn't last long.
Ok it is absolutely amazing!!You can run any game at the highst settingsI played frotnite and Farcry5 paladins and cs:GoIt was at the higest,I played the wither and it war in low side bt it was amazing wite itThe screen is very good it is fullHD and very good.The battery life is a little bit low but you can get 3:30 hours at normal use.
In 2007 I built my own gaming desktop, when I moved to college I spent $1800 on an Alienware gaming laptop which carried me from 2012-2017. Just bought this November of 17, and am extremely pleased. Lightweight, powerful enough to run all my steam games and MOBAs, with a great look and feel. All of this comes together in the most inexpensive computer I've ever owned.The only possible complaint I have is that the speakers do not get very loud, but the $30 I spent on an external speaker still puts the total cost of this hundreds of dollars below anything else I've owned.
I bought this after returning an HP laptop. I don't need a gaming computer but I like the power and speed for photo editing etc. This laptop has worked flawlessly out of the box despite it needing to upgrade Win 10 all night long. No issues as of yet. This is fast, slim, light and well built. I had an MSI gaming laptop prior to this one that lasted 6 - 8 years withstanding constant traveling before the HD failed. I could still replace the HD in it but decided to buy this one instead. The reason for 4 stars is: The battery life is just OK at about 4 or 5 hours. The other issue is that the charging cord has a large heavy transformer on it adding extra bulk and weight. MSI has always used these and they need to come up with something smaller and lighter. I can't speak about their customer service as I haven't had to deal with it.
Excellent laptop! Does exactly what we need it to and does it well.
The notebook is very powerful and stable. It worth more than the price.
The keyboard is so horrible and it is non replaceable anytime I type a paragraph at least a few words have missing letters because the key board doesnât pick up the letter
Haven't had it for long but so far its working great!
I like that laptop didnt even played yet cause i wait nearly 2 hour for now to load after restart. Windows 10 is shit,garbage and trash. I have 2 other laptop with i7 and i5 both windows 10 and both has same problems loading forever. Would be better if laptops would have Windows 7.
Ordered for my husband to do DJing & music production. He loves it, especially the speed, light-up keyboard, and functionality.
Came with a dead pixel on the screen, could not access the hdd drive, and it was missing the msi software that is supposed to be included
Great gaming laptop, especially for the price! This pc will meet your needs. I'm a FPS gamer, and it runs everything on ultra with a smooth 60+fps.
My wife and I are photographers. This is a wonderful computer for hd gaming, but while editing photos we found discrepencies with the color when we rendered the images in 4k. Slight issues unless your profession is based in picture quality. For the price, if you want to play fortnite it is fantastic.
Ok, first off, I'm gonna admit to the fact that I don't have much knowledge for computers. But I know enough to know the basics, like the processors, SSD, and stuff. Not gonna lie, I'm glad I went with MSI on my transition from being a Macbook user to joining the Windows family. I'm glad I snagged this computer at the perfect time, because I saved $200. It's probably one of the best deals I've seen- for a gaming computer, especially. The specs are amazing- the computer runs so fast, and not to mention the heap amount of storage you get for the price! Probably will be a computer I hold onto for a long time.I totally recommend this computer, get it before it loses the discount!
nice little gaming laptop but the screen seems flat , washed out a bit for an ips.
Very functional laptop. Good for school work and gaming. Skyrim has never run so smoothly. My only criticism is that it is prone to fingerprints. I don't particularly mind the lack of CD drive since most software is downloadable these days and I rarely burn CDs.
It was a pain to get up and running especially with all the auto updates. It also downloaded everything onto the SSD which caused problems and then I had to wipe the drives and start again...not plug and play...once configured (thanks youtube) works great now.
Really great, will priced, terrific value, happy son.
Best pc Iâve ever had but there was a problem with the graphics cards which I uninstalled and installed and was able to make them work like it did when I got the pc other than thatâs love it
Computer was good, except it was listed as new and I got a used one with someone else's email account still active on the desktop. Nice case.
So far so good! Very fast.
Its a cheaper gaming laptop, but the materials its poor quality my oil fingerprints gets so easy on the lids , the display looks good but probably it's need more deep colors . Comes.woth GTX 1050 4G Ti but no VR you can spend 150 dollars more and get some laptop with Gtx 1060 and VR
Equally good a development and gaming platform - very happy with this laptop.
This is a great computer. It's not got all of the GPU power that a bigger computer would have, but it does a great job. It's a bit disappointing to not have an optical drive, but it boots fast and runs fast.
Honestly this a pretty solid beginners gaming laptop I would highly recommend it
Because ever since my Iâve had it, my sister has been using it non-stop, and itâs currently at her house. According to her, itâs very good, high graphics to play overwatch and all that, so there.
Very nice gaming laptop,light&thin.I recommned the product for those are searching a gaming laptop bellow 1k.
Great nokebook !!
Came in with a broken GPU fan. It is suppose to turn on when you start gaming but mine wouldnât and the GPU would reach 90c which is way too hot. Other than that it was awesome and ran games fine.
Great package laptop. Battery life is not that great but that is to be expected for a gaming system. I would recommend for someone looking for an entry gaming or work station system.
An excellent laptop for gaming, music, video editing and photography. Lightweight, powerful and the keyboard colors are an added bonus.
As a dedicated gaming laptop it's pretty decent, but has trouble on higher settings with more taxing games.As a laptop for any other use, it's not good.The battery life irks me the most about this, and I kick myself for jumping the gun on buying this without actually reading reviews. I can't get 4 hours out of a full charge with light tasks like web browsing or typing papers for class, and gaming kills the battery in a ridiculously short amount of time.The display also looks washed out and I cannot find any way to adjust the color or saturation.The build construction feels cheap, though not overly flimsy. Mold lines left on both halves give a sharp edge that needs taken off with an emery board or sandpaper.I enjoy the appearance of the keyboard but it's far overhyped for what it is, a laptop membrane keyboard.In the end it's a $900 laptop that has some decent hardware but fails in almost every other category.
Great specs and well built but laptop life is around an hour with just google chrome running (writing an essay). If you donât mind staying plugged it itâs fine.
Great laptop, I use it for rendering 3D objects and works amazing! happy with my purchase
Battery dies fast, but in other aspects this laptop is 10/10!
It'sa good laptop. Fast and stable
Amazing Laptop, cant be more satisfied :)
Awesome laptop if you are having issues with the tridef webcam activation app you need to do is uninstall the tridef software and you can use the webcam like normal
I am new to laptop gaming, I mostly play fallout 3, dark souls, and runescape on this laptop. It runs all of them on high or ultra settings very well.
good lapto, I've been using it for 3 months and it works perfectly, except for the keyboard that hurt me.Where can I get this keyboard?Thank you:
Great laptop.
The computer is fine the way it is. The battery life is ridiculous though. Sometimes, my laptop only lasts for like 2 1/2 hours and I'm not even doing any type of gaming. Just normal stuff. Quite honestly, I regret getting it. You are literally paying a little over $900 for a computer that will die on you. I also hate that it gets dirty easily. For example, the smudges on the keyboard. The design on the mouse pad thing could have been better as well. They should have added a button or something where you can disable the mouse pad, that way it's not randomly clicking while you are typing something on the keyboard.The performance is great. I just wish that it had better design and the battery didn't die so quickly. Of course, if you want a better layout, you have to spend a little more money but tbh, again.. there are other designs out there for the same out of price or less that has the same specs and performance as this. You are literally paying for the name "MSI:.
all perfect, thanks
One word...(Amazing)
I bought this computer for my sister for Christmas and it actually performed better than what I expected. It's surprisingly fast and powerful for a laptop, plus it's build quality shows that. As for gaming, this thing absolutely owns it, with the ability to play literally any modern video game (I tested it with Overwatch and Destiny 2) at over 60fps at high graphics settings. This computer is great for power users, gamers and photo/video editors.
Great computer I'm currently using it for DJing and music production and it hasn't failed me yet.
I bought this PC to replace my cheap, 4 year old laptop. I was looking for something I can play newer titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League as well as older titles from the 90's and early 2000's. In addition, I wanted a fast processor to use business applications and internet browsers without any slowdown.The box looks awesome and came in a shipping box, which prevented any dents or damage. In the attached pictures, you can see everything it came with as well as detailed warranty information.For the past 3 months, this computer has met my expectations and more. While gaming, every game I've tried has successfully ran. Some games cannot run on the highest performance settings, but that was expected. Medium to high settings work well and look great.League of Legends- 60+ FPS, High graphicsAge of Empires III- 60 FPS, Mid-High graphicsRocket League- 50 FPS, High graphicsOld single player titles (Portal 2, Age of Empires II, Half-Life)- No limitationsMy biggest pet peeve is slow applications. I have run multiple webpages, Excel worksheets, and YouTube video simultaneously without any delay switching between tasks or within the applications.Overall, I recommend this laptop for any casual gamer or business professional.Hope this helps!
I really like it
Ok, so lets start from the screen which is LCD that is worse than an LED-LIT, and the bad processor time to respawn, cheap SSD and the DDR3 RAM, im so sad that i purchase this over the Helios300 with LED-LIT screen + gtx1060 + DDR4 16GB RAM + 256GB SSD and a 3.8 processor speed which is much better than a 2.8. All of that with a difference of 90$.
Great laptop, It's all than I expected from MSI products. I used it for games and had a great performance.
Bought this late last year for myself. Overall I'm happy with it. I went into it knowing it had a short battery life, was a little heavy, and possibly had a loud fan. The battery life is definitely really short, around 2 hours, so be prepared to carry around the charger with you. The fan makes noises, like any fan, it's fine. The backlit keyboard is nice and it's a really fast computer. Love the extra storage for my games. The sound quality good for the most part, I was expecting it to be a little bit better but no big deal. Overall very happy for my purchase. Make sure you know what things you're willing to sacrifice for a gaming laptop, because only the most expensive ones have everything you want.
Worked very well playing Witcher 3, Shadow of War and For Honor.
one of my best buy! Light for its size, good performance, overall great entry-level gaming laptop
No issue at all.
Its an amazing laptop with good price.Very fast with incredible proccessor
Computer seems nice, I just wish I could use it. Upon starting it up and getting my account connected it started to install windows updates, and failed repeatedly. It got to the point where it said it was "preparing to upgrade" and was stuck at 9% for hours. Currently been working on this for 12 hours total. It would not let me modify/install other programs while it was stuck so I couldn't just live with it either. I tried restarting the computer and the update status never changed, right at 9 % when the computer was turned back on. Currently doing a reset process just so I can get it working at least, hopefully I won't just be restarting another 12 hour process. Should not have to spend this much time right out of the box just to get it to run, quite infuriating. If the current patches are problematic could this computer not be shipped pre-updated?As I said before, it seems like it would be a nice computer if it just ran like it's supposed to.Edit 1:Still unable to get most recent version of windows running, but am running stable at an older version. May have to try a clean install of windows but I'm not looking forward to getting all the drivers this thing needs back on it if I do. Additional issue, the track pad has terrible drift. About 10% of the time when I click while I still have my finger on the track pad, it causes the cursor to shoot across the screen without my finger on the pad moving at all.Strongly considering returning at this point. Highly disappointing for a nearly $2000 laptop.
Great quality. Exceeded my expectations.
Wanted a mid-range, working out of the box gaming laptop. Got what I wanted and 1 month in, no complaints.
The computer came as fast as promised!
Just As I expected
Awesome 5 star
Awesome product
Great laptop love it.
Perfect as expected. Thank you.
Great choice
Works amazing took me less than 5 minutes to setup 5 more for updates and im gaming its great if you're like me always moving around traveling . Desktop is powerful but this little msi is Mobile and its packing strength. The handling and delleveing was beautiful Sooner than the estimated time by week !
Very happy.
Very cool
Battery life terrible. Lost 45% in 30 minutes of light use
When I opened the lid to this laptop it got caught on a small piece of black plastic in between both hinges and got stuck while trying to lift open the lid. Even though it was a certified refurbished item sold by amazon I was expecting the laptop to still come without an issue as basic as this wrong with it.
Laptop was packaged very nice, little bloatware, few updates to do right off the bat. Some Amazonians received a "Chinese only" Windows version, I did not.Out of the package the laptop looks great. Not super flashy, overall its aesthetically pleasing. When you open the lid you are met with a well designed Steelseries Keyboard. The laptop has a large palm rest area, almost too big imo, they could have spaced out the keyboard a bit better. I dont use laptop touchpads, but this one is one I would consider keeping my mouse unplugged for while web surfing and youtubing.Performance for the price is tough to beat. Beefy i7, little skimpy on the RAM only 8GB DDR4, easily upgradeable. Has the nVidia GTX 1050Ti 4GB GDDR5, the screen looks great no bleeding or anything, most laptops in this price range have just the 1050 or even lower specd GPUs. Also has 2 drives, a 128GB m.2 SSD which houses the Windows 10 OS, very speedy, I would buy a larger 2.5" SSD to replace the slow 1TB.I havent pushed this laptop yet, and I dont really plan on it, I have seen other users on youtube get the CPU up to 91C, so it may get too hot for your lap.Battery life is going to be atrocious, and I fully accept that, I plan to stay plugged.I am very pleased with my purchase of this laptop, for the price and specs, I dont think you can pass on it.
It is exactly what it says it is. It's great to play games on, or even edit videos.
The laptop is probably the best to its value as it can get if you are looking at pre-built laptop.Having that mind set, the gaming laptop works great with almost all current games, I run all games like BF1, Doom, Crysis even, the computer kept it performance at 60fps+ (on ultra, it can depends on hot or cold day, of which is another topic I will have.)The laptop can get hot, like magma in just a few minutes of gameplay, but as shown on the control center that MSI have built in, the system are fine, but the heat when gaming for a long time internally is always kept within 60-70 degree F, which is fine, however on the casing, it get extremely hot and you hands will suffer. This is used along with the cooler booster, a setting for its cooler fan to work full time.The fans are loud, like really loud, so if you intend to game, you are forced to wear a headset, which you can't for a long period.OS overview:Windows OS, windows 10 comes with itOffice is not registeredIntel HD graphics card are used in default, so please use nvidia center to set to the 1050 that comes with the laptop, if you use default option, graphic card windows error might be encountered in some game like CSGO, and the crash is fatal to force a restart.1 TB of storage.Do back up and register your laptop with MSI website, the code are entered for you automatically but some code are located beneath the laptopBatter power is about 2 hours on just normal surfing, 1 hour if you game, and 3hr max if you use batter saver, but the manual suggest that you keep the plug in as all time when you use the laptop so I suspect these numbers will change. Though it has a built in Battery calibration of which I have not tried me self.The specific product I receive come with its OS being English, I know some people receive it under Chinese language, but you can change it through some quick googling using your phone if your other computer is long gone.
So far so good. SSD makes startup a breeze. That alone is worth the tad bit more money. The graphics card is fine. I run games on medium graphic settings to avoid FPS drops and network lag and so far it has been smooth sailing.
Came with one of the lid hinges undone the second I lifted the lid. There is a very cheap plastic bar that covers the hinges that apparently just snaps in and out.
This laptop just pissed me off so badly I bought it like one week ago and now the laptop just never work ever again. And the noise of this laptop is really bad. HATED (worst gift for my brother ever )
My son is very happy with his purchase (he saved for a long time!). He is using it for gaming and to learn programming.
Anazing laptop so far I have had it a month no issues I play PUBG , League , fortnite and more all smooth on the highest settings and PUBG actually loads textures well. I recommend you utilize the SSD if you donât know what it is itâs the D drive and install games there so itâs smooth sailing.
I've had this pc for 2 days .. and it just stopped stopped working . Checked power supply and all .. poorly built pc !
Poorly refurbished? Original box, no discs / manual; was missing software that was suppose be included and the gpu crashed whenever the pc was shutdown. Took it to a shop to be fixed. < _ > Works fine now.
A trash screen, you will see nothing if the angle is not right.
OK just a few notes. The computer runs well but a few side notes:Although the GTX 1050 TI is now listed as being the minimum recommended for VR, it is NOT VR ready. A test by Occulus Rift program shows it to not meet the minimum requirements.The computer uses a dual display driver system. This means that not all games will utilize the Nvidia GTX 1050 TI card. It may utilize the Intel 630 and run Nvidia for the Physics only. (though I bench-marked this system with both Valley and Furmark, the individual game will ultimately decide which card will run when playing. You can select the Physics to run Nvidia under global or application. I.E. Fallout 4 will default to the on-board Intel 630 GFX processor. This doesn't mean that it does not run well it does, you are simply not getting all the optimization from the GTX 1050 TI Card.)Furthermore the Nvidia Ge-force Experience program will not run with this system currently. I am looking into this further with Nvidia. Apparently in its 2d running state the program cannot detect the 1050 TI and therefore will not optimize anything.For the prices this is a very good mid-rangeMSI GL62M 7REX-1896US 15.6" Full HD Thin and Light Gaming Laptop Computer Quad Core i7-7700HQ, GeForce GTX 1050Ti 4G Graphics, 8GB DRAM, 128GB SSD + 1TB Hard Drive, Steelseries Red Backlit KeyboardÂ laptop, but if you want an MSI laptop with switchable gfx you will need anything in the GT line of Laptops.
Great Choice....Recomanded
Good value for money. Got this during the cyber monday deal and it has exceeded my expectations for a sub $1000 laptop
Awesome gpu and ssd. Screen is reflect proof but is fuzzy at angles. Overall great machine!
I was looking for a gaming laptop under 1,000$ with powerful GPU, there were lot of options out there, but everyone has its own cons which held me from buying it, the options I have been Lenovo Y520, Asus 553, Dell 7567, Acer Predator Helios 300 and MSI GL62MY520 had a horrible keyboard and numpad even though its screen was great, Dell was heavy as a piano, Helios was an amazing option especially on the black Friday, it dropped from 1,050$ to 900$ yet I passed it. and then came to the GL62M and purchased with a great offer of 800$ from Amazon (but from my brother's account) that's why I'm not seen as a verified purchase.Anyway, coming to the pros and cons, What I like about the GL62M:- Lightweight comparing to others from the same category- The keyboard is noiseless- The laptop runs cool and quiet, except while gaming It would become a chopper but that's fine with me- Powerful GPU 1050TI, CPU I7-7700 which makes gaming experience so amazing, played COD WW2 and Shadow of war both on High details FHD- It came with 1TB HDD, and Samsung 128GB SSD reaching 2700MB/s reading speed and 520 Writing speed- Came with English version of windows not as many people complained about getting a Chinese version, boots up in 13 secsWhat I didn't like about it:- The windows key is on the right side of the space which is weird and sometimes frustrating during my office work (Win+D) along with Del, home and end keys being in an abnormal place, other than that its good keyboard- Screen: the TN screen is not quite the deal for gaming, its fine with office work and browsing, but when it comes to gaming, it will be a bit of a disappointment.- Speakers: I'm not going to say they are fine, unfortunately, they are not, I didn't imagine that my 3 years old Lenovo Y510 would sound way much better than this laptop, I laughed when I heard the speakers because I thought it was a joke, yet most people use headphones for gaming or music, that's why I didn't take out a star at this point, and I'm using a Bluetooth JBL speaker during gaming.- Battery life: it lasts for 2.5 - 3 hours of office work and browsing in the best situation.Generally speaking, I'm loving this laptop even with the previously mentioned disadvantages especially (screen, speakers)This is the first laptop I use from MSI in my life, I am a Lenovo fan but it really worth the go, even with the current price of 900$ it really worth it, if you can ignore the screen and the speakers.Finally, I like this laptop and I am planning to keep it for the next 2 years.
Bought this machine after reading all of the positive reviews to replace my 5 year old Samsung gen 3 i7. I'm not impressed with this laptop to say the least. I'm a professional photographer and intended to utilize this machine when I'm out in the field. This laptop display is absolutely horrible. The color accuracy is atrocious, and the viewing angles are also terrible. My 5 year old Samsung display blows this machine out of the water. I tired contacting msi tech support which is basically non-existent, and completely worthless trying to see if there was a solution for the display. I received lots of canned response which I performed all with zero improvement. I also suspect that this machine won't last due to its cheap poor construction. It's a cheap all plastic build and the monitor hinges are very poorly made. Lots of flex across the board, even when placed on flat surfaces. This machine also has an abundance of fan noise even under light load. The machine is snappy and ran smoothly but the display was a deal breaker for me. I really wanted to like this machine but ultimately it's getting returned. I'd recommend spending a little more money and getting something other than this machine.
I have mixed feelings about this laptop. I was excited to find a brand name gaming laptop under one grand that offered exceptional specs for my gaming needs. On paper, this laptop met those needs. With a quad core i7-7700HQ, GTX 1050Ti, 8GB DRAM, and 128GB SSD + 1TB Hard Drive, it was certainly appealing. Space for games, the next best graphics card that isn't VR ready (which I had no immediate interest in), the price is exceptional and very affordable, and it had the brand name MSI.However, the LCD screen is so noticeably terrible that is literally ruins the experience for me. I initially assumed there wouldn't be a notable difference between LED and LCD, and oh boy, was I wrong. I want to congradulate MSI on making such a terrible screen. I feel as if you went out of your way to find and produce the cheapest quality screen you could. If you're interested in buying this laptop, please take this into account. However, I am such a snob that instead of trying out or buying and keeping the Acer Helios 300 laptop, I will keep this laptop simply because "MSI". Also, Acer just does not inspire trust. Good fight me.In addition, almost no drivers or updates come pre-installed. You'll have to manually download all Windows updates and Nvidea drivers which, in my case, somehow took 5 hours to complete. Certainly frustrating, but not completely unexpected. Laptop screen is a little flimsy. It wobbles a bit more than other laptops normally do, when you are adjusting the placement. It also retains every and all fingerprints.Taking a step away from aesthetics, on the gaming side, I have not had ample opportunity to game hardcore, but have noticed lag when playing simple RPGs like Runescape. I am hoping I am missing some update drivers that are messing up my performance or I will be returning this within 30 days.Will update my review as time goes on.Good luck.
Laptop was working perfectly until, after two weeks, it simply died after playing a very non demanding game, kerbal space program. Temperatures were normal and the computer just randomly crashed and then could never post.In order to attempt to fix this on my own I went to take out the battery for 10 seconds. However, the battery casing is very poorly design--its placed inside the case!! Its not like the hp laptops where you can just swap it out easily by pushing a button. No, you have to remove a good 12 screws and take off the bottom panel just to remove the battery. I also sliced open my finger trying to undo all of the annoying latches without breaking the flimsy bottom panel. Oh, and by the way, it took me 10 minutes to realize that there was another screw hidden under the dumb factory seal label!!!! Very annoying and frustrating since it was very stealthily hidden. Lastly, you'll want to make sure you're very gentle when removing the case because it would be very easy to break off the little plastic latches that snap the bottom panel on.Currently put a support ticket into MSI and fortunately I'm within warranty, so I will update this depending on their responsiveness and ability to get my laptop working.So far im very disappointed, but I understand that electronics sometimes have flaws because of the laws of probability, and it may have actually been nvidia's or intel's fault, so I will revert this to 4 stars if MSI solves my problem. It would be 5 stars if the battery wasn't behind the bottom panel.UPDATE:MSI's RMA process was excellent. They did a very professional repair, it looks brand new and runs well. I was worried that they might mess up the thermal paste after putting in a new mobo, but it appears. Apparently there was a crack in the chassis that I did not even know about and they replaced and fixed it to without me even mentioning it! They've done right by me and I am impressed. I would give this 5 stars, but its not quite perfect due to the fact that the battery is on the inside and you have to remove 12 screws to get to hit. Besides that however this is an excellent product. I'll update if this dies again but MSI RMA service was fast and beyond expectation. Including shipping, receiving, them having to get new parts, and them fix it, it only took 2 weeks, and they rushed it so that I could get it before my trip. You won't be dissatisfied with the RMA service if you need it, so you can probably trust that MSI will do right by you. Thumbs up MSI. Killer deal for 899.
It seems to be working fine, but the battery only lasting for about 1.5hrs (2hrs saver mode) is a deal breaker in my book.
mousepad is aweful
Nice laptop !
Received product just yesterday and began Windows 10 updates. After 24 hours, it is now stuck at 99%. The response from MSI customer service to my inquiry was either to start over again or (paraphrasing) go tell Microsoft. Very disappointed. Also, if this matters to you, the comments about finger prints easily marking the case are true. I am returning.
so many damn fingerprints on this thing, and it's weird because they don't come off. Also, the screens suck. I wish I would not have bought this honestly.
I have one model earlier than this laptop, and it has been almost exactly 1 year since I bought it. I bought this laptop because I needed something cheap that I could use for 3D work on the go, take into meetings, etc.This is a really fantastic laptop if you want a good price for great performance. In its unused time, I have been running it 24/7 constantly calculating BOINC calculations for the SETI massive parallel computation project. This is a killer calculation that is very hard on computers, maxing out both the CPU and the GPU simultaneously. My Macbook air overheated and totally died after just a few months running like this. Two of my desktops also choked on it. This laptop, though, gets really hot, but just keeps on going!Performance wise, it has been great for just about every game I have played on it. It's pretty close to desktop level performance. I also was running the Oculus Rift with it (on a GTX 1060 card) without issue, so the newer model with even upgraded specifications should be great for such tasks.Reliability wise, it's just kept on going. It has be very dependable.It's a larger laptop, so maybe not for everyone. It gets hot in use, and it is really hungry for power with a quite short battery life. It's enough to get through a meeting, but if I'm the presenter I will always bring my power brick.I cannot speak for their tech support / service, as I never had the need, which I guess is good.We bought several others for folks at my work, and they have all been running great as well, as far as I know.Bottom line: This is a great "lots of power for the money" laptop that has been super reliable for me, and I would recommend it to anyone with similar needs to me, but not if all you need a super lightweight long battery life unit for just email and facebook.
Bought the laptop around November last year as my old laptop died (RIP to my number one solider). Ive always been a fan of MSI but never actually owned any of their products. 7 months in to owning it and it has proven to be such a reliable laptop for every game i play ( league of legends, CSGO, PUBG, Fortnite, Fifa 18, Hunt: Showdown etc.).Id highly recommend this laptop if you are looking for a laptop that can hold up to most games without giving you issues.
Don't waste your time with their PCs. They have good options but terrible design, but parts and no reasonable support. They have terrible keyboard and GSU problems now! You can almost be guaranteed you will have problem with keys not working while it's still under warranty. You will have to send your PC to them, bouncing it across the country with UPS drop kicking it along the way and back, then you will get it back with the same problems occurring! Who wants to put their new PC through all this? It becomes a perpetual problem and you will never get everything resolved or want to keep sending it back, so you may put up with problems because of it. This is no way to spend time or money on a product when the people servicing it just DON'T CARE!! STAY AWAY!
Overall itâs a good gaming laptop. On the other hand, the screen could be better (I expected higher fps) and so as the fan noise while playing the latest games like pubg for example. But I really like this fast, thin, and light gaming laptop. Itâs really good for school purposes too because itâs portable and you wonât look like a âgamerâ?when youâre using it in public places compared to other gaming laptops.
Bought this computer for both gaming and college, every game I play runs on ultra (Overwatch, WoW, GTA, Battlefront) It gets a little heated sometimes, 80 degrees Celsius, but Im gonna get an Opolar laptop cooler one of these days. Strats up in 2 seconds, fast, no complains so far
A very good choice for those who looks for a high performance laptop for gaming purposes!
Best laptop at low budget, i loved from the first start. Amazing display and crazy performance, small battery but is a laptop for gaming that no matter a lot.
It's great laptop but not as fast thought it would be. Multitasking on laptop seem too much for the computer sometimes. But overall performance is great.
I like pc/laptops, I also really like gaming, smash those together and it creates this. I really like this laptop, It gets the job done!
i reset my laptop but i think i broke my laptop .. because of the reseting
My honest review of MSI gaming laptop after 7 days.NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti is amazing.Every high-end game which I played runs very smooth.The laptop is very thin and light as compared to others.15.6" Full HD screen is a heaven.Keypad is of perfect size for longer gaming intervals.Windows 10 is far better than Ios. Go for it.Use code to get discount on purchase. Go to:bit.do/ amazon-store
MSI sells lemon laptops. They go out with in months or a year. The warranty department is terrible. They acted like they did not know what was happening when it happens all the time. The construction is bad. Half plastic and metal and extremely fragile. It over heats since the design makes it overheat. Quality control needs to improve. Just tells you that is all about profit not customer service. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!
This could be a great laptop...except the webcam it comes with, that is installed...must then be purchased to be used...except--when you go to the website it sends you to in order to purchase the activation key...the website is deemed insecure and may harm your computer. SO, I have no idea how much it cost to use the webcam that my laptop came with, and as a result, I cannot connect to Skype to talk to my husband and must continue to use my old Toshiba.I refuse to give this pc a better score when the description says it comes with webcam, but does not state at anytime you must buy activation key to use it.I've waited nearly six years to afford an MSI laptop...niw, I wish I'd never gotten it. ð©I'm ready to return this MSI to Amazon and purchase a whole new laptop from a different company. MSI, make this right.
This laptop is a waste of money. Bought it and try to run league but it does not work! Even my 4 years old laptop can run league!
We return the computer this not support the Oculus Rift .
DO NOT PURCHASE A MSI LAPTOP! We purchased a MSI laptop and in less than 2 years, we had to take it into the repair shop for a 2nd time. They told us we need to replace the motherboard because over half of the plastic screws (yes, cheap plastic) broke and caused the keyboard to shift and the casing was coming apart. Unreal.
Nice laptop, perfect for programming using terminal. Installed ubuntu instead.
Arrived today (2-21-18)....not impressed by how cheap the feel of this laptop is, I can get over that. I plugged in the charger, powered up/configured account information....noticed response time was a bit sluggish but I continued to install email/dropbox and windows updates, walked away from this laptop for a few hours came back and my dropbox was transfering via (LAN @ 1Gb) at 1 Gig per hour, that's nuts (way to slow)...noticed that the hard drive activity was at 100% did the usual stopping of services like windows search, Background Intel and Skype uninstall, but still this 100% hard drive activity won't go away, even after a reboot the computer is sluggish even at the login screen, after a few hours of troubleshooting I decided to reset the OS back to factory and see what that does. As you can see in the pictureI did the reset, and that seemed to fix the 100% hard drive activity, now a physical issue and unfortunately there is nothing that can be done, a 2TB-2.5inch HDD spins at 5400 rpm and that really slows up the performance of this machine the RAM and CPU are skating along and the HDD is at 100% and overheating, installing a SSD drive would solve this issue but storage is still expensive, a 250Gb SSD is under $100, and good luck taking this computer apart also, you can't add a second physical drive in this as another reviewer stated it did, I saw a video from HP on the previous model to this and the insides of this are packed tight. so I stopped removing the back cover I didn't have the right pry tool to seperate the case and I really didn't want pry marks all over thisAnother issue, windows updates is taking forever.....it's doing the feature update and the computer is at 0% updated after 45 mins and yes there is a HDD light/indicator on this....of course it's on the side of the unit so you have to look around the monitor to see it and it's lit and chugging away thanks to the 5400 rpm HDD in a fast machine (it took 4 1/2 hours to do this win10 features update)I will give this laptop a few days and make my judgement call, but I am going to start the paperwork for the return on this unit, I'm not an optimist with this computer but, I will give it a chanceThe Pro's: Excellent CPU, the benchmarks on this is what made me decide to purchase it, also 12Gb RAMThe Con's: read everything above the Pro'sEven with the reset OS and the physical limitations of the HDD This machine should be faster than it is, I have a few 5400 rpm hard drives in much older computers than this and they are okay in speed, a lot faster than this. I am now thinking there is something physically wrong with the hardware or hard drive another reviewer stated he had the same issues and seems now so do I, time to do another OS reset and back to Amazon it goes (after a few days), and no I will not recommend this to a friend or enemy and I will not purchase this again. Back to Acer or Toshiba no more HP's great name, crap laptopUpdate 2-23-18: I am trying really hard to like this computer, I uninstalled Crapavee AntiSpeed What they call Anti-Virus and other things that I don't need but I like Movie Maker and you can still download it and when I did called "Microsoft Essentials 2012" it took 10 minutes to install. when this laptop updated to the latest win10 feature it took 4 and 1/2 hours, don't think of multi-tasking on this machine just watch the task manager hard drive activity, it will always zoom to 100% while the CPU and RAM are surfing along with no effort, maybe I'm spoiled by the SSD drives, but watching the task manager tells me the brick wall on this laptop is the 5400 rpm hard drive.Final Update: I purchased a Samsung 850 Evo 250G SSD Drive, removed the sluggish 5400 HDD, installed the Samsung SSD (see pic) downloaded from Microsoft Win 10 ISO burned to DVD and USB Installed OS in 15 minutes...(wow) Installed updates (super fast) went to activation and it was already activated through my Microsoft account but it was the Win10 Home edition, I have Win7 Pro so I added my product key and now this HP-SSD Upgrade Laptop has Win10 Pro. This laptop is now super fast (it should be) with the $96 SSD drive and I will purchase a USB3 external drive case for the factory 2TB HDDand use it for my 1TB Dropbox as well as data. I now have a great computer for $627.64 ...the cover isn't really that hard to remove just to let you know under the rubber feet there is a screw below each pad.if you are willing to work with it and changing out the HDD for a SSD this computer is well worth the cost of $627.64and I did a benchmark test and with the SSD drive this computer is highly ratedLast Thoughts: I spent too much time to get this laptop to this level (I'm typing this update on it) but it is the fastest computer you can get for the price, I have a 8 year old desktop and this laptop is taking its place and after working on this laptop for a few days then going to my desktop there is no comparison, this laptop is a keeper. I use Photoshop and this laptop processes fast ..... it's good to see the RAM, CPU and SDD are all on the same workload
I use the laptop for my brand / web design business - it's great! It's able to handle all my graphic design programs without going slow. I'm terrible about having a gazillion tabs open on my browser and several graphic design programs open at once, plus my email program, this laptop can handle it all just fine. The web cam is nice and screen share/capture programs work nicely on it. So glad I got it - worth the value!
This laptop is working out great so far. Really like how fast it runs and the price was really good. Don't seem to see any slowness after installing the Meltdown and Spectre patch from Microsoft.
This is the biggest piece of crap of computer I have ever had. It ran extremely slow when I got it an would not hook up to the internet. I just wanted to use it for Quickin accounting and taxes not a big drag on the machine. Didn't like what I got but they would not take it back to look at it. Had a computer repair look at it found out it had a hard drive that was used and defective. also it came with a virus that would not let the airplane more turn off so the internet connect. What you are getting is used parts in a new case. DO NOT BUY IT IS CRAP!!!!! I WAS TOTALLY RIPPED OFF!!!!!
This laptop is a definite improvement over my older HP Elitebook 8440p that had a dual core i5 at 2.5GHz. It is faster and just more responsive, plus had a much larger hard drive and more RAM (12GB vs 8). I kinda wish I'd gone with a higher speed processor (this one is 1.6GHz) as I think it would be MUCH faster overall (that's the only reason for the 4 star instead of 5 star). But for programs that take advantage of it, the quad core i5 definitely speeds things up. Very large spreadsheets (30,000 records and many fields/columns) are surprisingly fast to process with complex formulas. And FWIW, I kinda like the color. Drawbacks are that it's fairly flimsy plastic, a little heavy, and the power button is a little hard to push. But for the price (just over $500 when I bought it)? Great!
The only reason the computer did not get 5 stars is because the picture and the description show a dark blue computer, but it is purple.
Has the specs I needed for a reasonable price. Build feels slightly cheap, but since this laptop will mostly sit in one place it should be durable enough. About as small in physical size as any laptop WITH an optical drive can be, and I still have many DVDs I want to use on this laptop so getting one of the many laptops without optical drives was not an option.
This laptop is really a piece of junk. I have all kind of trouble with it. I had to take it to a technician 3 times. He had to replace the hard drive, it was working for one day, then it goes blank when I put it on. I have to buy another computer.
Purchased as a graduation present for my Granddaughter so I can't speak to how it works...
Very good computer at a very good price two problems they're both my fault cuz I didn't really notice.... the first is bright purple like not dark purple or bluish purple but bright purple like a clown color but I got a skin for that ....so the only real technical problem is no key lights it has no keyboard lighting so even in dim light it's very difficult to use.
Fast and awesome love it!!!! This was a fantastic deal.
It's a great machine, fast and reliable, would have given it a 5 if it wasn't for the battery which doesn't last long, with full charge it will last just 3-4 hours of use, even with 70% brightness.
The real negative is the color is not blue but a ghastly purple. Wish it had a backlit key board and the power on and off button is a pain to use.
Excellent laptop to use and to navigate
The laptop works great, has everything we needed, like Microsoft office pre loaded. Everything came as it should. Love it!
Such and amazing laptop
It was delivered ahead of schedule. Kind of, just started it up, seems to function as expected, but I'll delve deeper at another time. I do have an immediate complaint. The computer I ordered was "marine blue", said it in the description, but this one is "PURPLE". I guess you can read but are still having issues with colors. Not the first time I've ordered a product and it was "THE WRONG COLOR". Going to keep the laptop, I don't want to go through the ----- of returning it, I don't have to see the color with the lid open. I submit the need to teach your associates about "colors". And yes, it makes a difference. I'm afraid I' have to search elsewhere for a more reliable source for future large purchases. Thanks!
Impressed with the speed
Computer is slower than my old HP, and continually hangs ups when you click on a address or any icon which should launch something anything, I have tried restarting and still nothing, until out of the blue it will start working again. very disappointed in this laptop.
Great new computer
You won't find better specs for the money. Both M2 SSD and 1TB HDD. 5400RPM is pretty terrible but better than no drive. Forget all the petty complaints. People are clueless and blame the hardware. Run all the Windows updates as soon as you unbox it over Ethernet cable and not WIFI to avoid issues. Then after all Windows updates complete and you have OS Build 1709, right click the Dell updater in the icon tray next to the clock on the toolbar and scan for Dell updates and drivers.After doing all of these steps first, I have had zero lag, zero Chrome browser issues, etc. Lastly, go to Nvidia's website and install GeForce Experience. From there you can download and install the latest drivers for the GTX 1050. Most Motherboards have on-board graphics but when the Nvidia drivers are installed they take default GPU. I wish this laptop had a metal chassis but for the price point I'm being unrealistic. The plastic case really isn't that bad. Buy this thing and have no regrets.
Notes (05/02/2017):- Make sure to update all drivers on Dell's website, for some reason their software do not pick up the new updates- Experienced some glitches as well as some malfunctioning with headphone jack drivers, but everything is working fine so far.- Battery life is impressive. Being doing papers and projects on Adobe Muse, Illustrator, Photoshop, Word, Excel as well as browsing for at least 4-5 hours solely on battery.
Pros:-Excellent Dell customer service (I asked them to have a look at cpu and gpu for overheating. They replaced my motherboard, fans and heat pipes via an onsite engineer without question)-Cheapest gaming rig for this specs.-Very long battery life - 10 hours (I take it school w/o charger and it runs all day)-It runs anything for now.-3 USB 3.1s, 1 of which is thunderboltCons:-128GB SSD is merely enough for Windows 10. I ended up installing all the games on HDD.-It weighs 3 kg, charger is 0.5 kg not good for everyday carry around.-Screen is not very bright and has narrow view angles.-Bass is at the bottom. Creates vibration on top of a solid ground such as a table.-Fans get loud under load. But that's a generic laptop problem.
Once I finally got the cash I spent a month deciding on which laptop was the most bang for my buck. This is the budget gaming laptop I've been looking for. I don't just game either. I do data analytics and photo/video editing. This handles it all. Also, with the design when I'm in a public space it doesn't scream GAMER.It's a little heavier than I'd like, but I'm not a fragile old man so it doesn't really bother me. Everything is easily upgradable. Literally one screw pops out and you can reach the hardeive and memory. This will be great for first timers. The screen needs to be replaced. The viewing angles are awful. You can get another screen for about $25 and replacement looks pretty easy. It's like putting legos together.After a screen replacement I don't think there's another laptop that has the build quality or power for this price.
The good:Hardware, very good performance for a portable.Keyboard and trackpad are nice if you are into using those.Display looks good,Decent battery life considering the hardware, about 4h30min.The OK:Red accents not as gaudy as expected.Still a bit gaudy but beats paying double the price for a non gaming laptop with similar hardware.The annoying:This is a common thing with "gaming" laptops, dual GPUs, intel and nvidia one, if you add a USB display you need 3 drivers that don't really work well with each other. I ended up setting up a script that reinstalls whichever driver I want to use.The bad:As with most laptops bloatware ridden win10, I recommend zeroing it out and installing something decent.Speakers, you don't expect good speakers on a laptop but dell has outdone themselves with these ones, they are worse than 20 year old blown out drive-thru speakers used to sell questionable tacos.
I compared a bunch of different laptops suitable for gaming and work. This one was the best price for the specs I was looking for. Build quality is nice. It doesn't feel cheap. It has a matte, slightly rubbery finish which feels nice. No, the screen is not an ips panel but it still looks pretty good. I have high quality monitors for my desktop and this screen doesn't bother me a bit. It can run most of the newest games on medium settings. I get 50-60 fps on BF1 and that's without any further tweaking. I thought the red accents would turn me off but it actually looks pretty nice. Not too "loud" or bright. The fans do get a bit noisy but not too bad to where it's annoying. Overall, I would say this is a great gaming laptop in it's price range. It boots fast and runs windows applications very quickly thanks to the ssd and i7. Almost as quick as my desktop with an i7, GTX 1080, 16gb ram, etc. You really don't need more than 8gb of ram unless you are doing some serious multi tasking.
I've had the laptop for two months and haven't had a single issue. It runs clean and is very responsive. I had to upgrade the RAM because I do virtualization and some machine learning stuff, but the fact that all I had to do is supply more RAM is a testament to the quality of the laptop. Also, after installing the new RAM the boot time went down noticeably. Power-on to login screen takes about 5 seconds.For those interested, this is the RAM I bought:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BIWKP58/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
A great gaming laptop, but not the best. I would not recommend this product because of the LCD screen is cheap and very bad. However, the graphics and gameplay are magnificent because of the Intel Core i7 and NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX. The battery life is okay, but you would definitely want to take your charger with you when you're going somewhere with it. The design looks normal and it's not that heavy, which makes this laptop easy to travel with and even take it to your work place or school. There are way more better gaming laptops than this. Although, the graphics are magnificent on this, the LCD screen is trash. This just hurts my eyes after few hours of playing GTA V. Pros: All the games run smoothly and the audio quality is quite good. Cons: Am awful screen for a gaming laptop.
I received my Dell Inspiron Gaming Laptop - 15.6" Full HD, Core i7- on Jan 12, 2018I've used it for 3 months and the device doesn't work anymore,From the beginning I had a problem, I created my personal profile and 3 days later when I turned on the computer and tried to log in it didn't allowed me anymore, it said that the system couldn't access anymore to the profile, I loosed important information with that and I had to create a new profile and install everything again, I couldn't recover my information.After that, the device worked more or less good for the next 3 months, I really only used it for web surfing and to listen to music.A couple of weeks ago I was ONLY listening to music, then I stop to using the computer for a couple of minutes, and when I tried to use it again it showed that the computer was starting a recovering process that never worked, the system failed.Now it only shows a black screen that says Boot failure on Device.Also the battery of the computer last at the most 1.5 hours, even if it was full charged and the device is new!!This has been the worst computer in my life.I request my warranty, how is it possible that with only 3 months this expensive computer doesn't work anymore?I used the computed always in a correct way, I read the devices manual before open it and start to using it.Im always very careful with my devices, never had an accident, no damages from my part.It was very clear from the beginning that this device had something wrong, it's evident that the computer has some hardware manufacturing defects.I need and urgent answer and warranty.
The item arrived just as pictured. The look and feel is great. The surfaces are covered in a soft rubber that makes if feel comfortable to rest your palm or wrist on and also provide better grip than the normal plastic material most laptops come with at this price range. For a gaming oriented laptop it is definitely more on the sleek end of the style spectrum and the red accents are a darker in colour. The mousepad and keys are very responsive. I have fairly large hands and the smaller keys are still not an issue, although the direction keys are the smallest I have seen on any keyboard layout and could be bigger in my opinion.Specs wise, I researched fairly extensively, and for the 699 deal I got this laptop for there was nothing that could match. No system on any major retailer I could find had a laptop with an i7-7700 and a 1050 at 700 unless it did not have windows installed. For the 899 regular price there are certainly competitive options, but if it's on sale again I'm sure you will not be disappointed. I don't have a great gaming reference as far as super demanding games, but playing some WoW since I picked it up I have managed to stay at 70-100+ fps at near max graphic settings.
Don't buy laptops on Amazon!! I received 2 of these now (tried to replace the first hoping it was just a random failure) and both repeatedly power down right in the middle of using them. Reset both with no resolution. Looks like a batch of bad hardware. Both did this right out of the box. When I went to return the second laptop, I'm only allowed account credit. This means I'm forced to buy a replacement from Amazon which I'd rather not do at this point. Its a large amount of cash tied up on account credit. I am so incredibly disappointed.
There was a hardware problem with the speakers on day one. Its glitchy with sort of a feedback sound, regardless of device. I worked with Dell tech support for a long time to realize we needed to send it to them to have it fixed. This is a very common problem, and the tech support and online forum were not shocked. It might take up to two weeks before I get the brand new laptop back and I hope that the costs are covered because its frankly ridiculous.
Honestly,I Had to buy a new laptop because my old was stopped loading windows for some reason. And after watching a bunch of reviews/ reading articles about affordable gaming laptops I decided to buy this.It's been a great investment so far. Typing experience is fair ( I do wish I could Keep the keyboard lights on though). The screen is what I expected for a older TN panel. The Wireless card however blew me away with the speeds I am able to get.I use this laptop as my main work laptop and for gaming when I travel (which I might add is quite frequently). It has been nothing but good to me. The battery life is also amazing! I would highly suggest this to anyone in the market for a laptop >$1100 USD as the internal specs and experience cant be beat.
This is a great product. For the first 6 months. After that its downhill, especially if you are trying to play any sort of games. So far I have already had to send it off to be repaired once for random shutoffs all they did was replace the battery. I had already updated all drivers and installed all bios updates. Now my pc when plugged in constantly shuts off and bluescreens and I can't send it off again since school has started. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Actual waste of 800 bucks for a "GAMING" laptop that I can't even game on.
Its a pretty good laptop it just doesnt seem durable I read other reviews of other people complaining about the pieces in the back of the laptop breaking off and i thought mine would be different. In less than a week a piece broke off of mine while being carried in the case. Definitly a let done as far as performance it does everything I want it to. The fans are definitly loud though you cannot be sneaky with thing everyone will know you are in the room.
I'm typing on it right now. First off, fast! Even the Windows 10 sign in screen cannot stop it for long.Secondly, after I set up the data terabyte as the storage for the machine, there seems to be nothing in the way of finding whatever I need in seconds.Gaming: Borderlands 2 is no problem. Dead Island required that I shut down some visual atmospheric effects, but sound was unaffected by the system.I edit video and sound files, both of which were effortless. Using Nomad ETC lighting software in blind mode was easy, which I cannot say about my old HP laptop.
I had my original laptop (a Toshiba Satellite M505) since 2010 and it work well for everything I used it for. Then last month the second battery died along with the charger, so it was time to upgrade and after looking at all the options I choose the Dell Gaming laptop. I've had it for about a month now and so far, it has been a wonder to explore. The processing speed feels lightning quick compared to what I had and the quality of graphics is quite nice. I found the backlight for the keypad to be an amazing feature letting me type when its dark or hard to see well inside. I'm still learning about the other features and programs pre-installed but so far, they have shone usefulness (NVidia GeForce account, Xbox connection, Windows Defender, etc.). I should also talk about Windows 10, my original laptop started with Windows 7 and worked beautifully till they upgraded to Windows 10. It still ran well but certain programs and links to accounts simple got lost or could never connect. This laptop came with 10 so it has those bugs solved and most of the issues solved. Now for the big one: the gaming experience, was it good? Answer: yes, like I never have before! Playing on or offline, plugged-in or not gaming has never been so smooth for me. I joined steam ad installed Hollow Knight and itâs been a blast all the way. Battery life with last between 7 to 5 hours while gaming, and supposedly up to 15 hours when passive, unheard off for my previous laptop. As for the cons of this computer, not many but they are distinct. This laptop comes with a SD card slot, 3 USB ports, a LAN plug, and a HBMI port. It does have a DVD player, this can be a pro or con since there are no major moving parts inside to break or collect dust, but it means music discs ad movies will need to be on flash drives or you need to get a portable DVD player. The other major issue can be price, at 900 it can be pricey, though compared to other laptops with some of the same features itâs a good deal. So, in summary: Pros - great control, lightweight, good graphics, long battery life, useful built-in features and programs, solid-state hard drive with no moving parts, and strong compatibility with Windows 10. Cons - no DVD drive and soft keyboard along with a mid-range price tag. Overall, I have enjoyed the Dell experience and I have to say I love learning everything this computer has to offer.
Great buy! If you've never used an SSD before, the performance increase is immediately noticeable (assuming your OS is booting from it). If you're considering buying primarily for gaming, I'd suggest spending a bit more money for a higher level GTX graphics card and maybe more RAM. However, I am running games like Starcraft 2 and Command and Conquer 4 on maxed out graphics with absolutely no lag or frame rate issues. As for the newest games, I'm not sure the GTX 1050 will hold up, but this is still a solid gaming laptop and the SSD paired with the i7 processor provides for a quick and responsive experience.
I bought this laptop 7 months ago. When I first started it, everything was fine. I noticed that the hinge was way too small and fragile for this heavy laptop so I always remind myself to handle it with maximum care. I dont know who design this kind of hinge and why he thinks this hinge would hold such a heavy laptop. This laptop ran into many troubles but luckily, I am an engineer so I know how to fix those.If you have intention of buying this laptop or already bought it, let me give you my thought on it:+ Always check for updates. Especially when you first run it.+ Even though this is a laptop, I dont think "portability" applies to it since it is heavy and the hinge is too weak.+ It will run into troubles, which certainly also happens to all other laptops. I have never owned any laptop that has no problem and thanks to that, I am so good at fixing both software and hardware problems. So if it runs into problem, dont panic, go to Google and you will figure out how to fix it.+ For this price, please dont expect too much since it is too good for a laptop with reasonable configuration.
I have been looking for a budget gaming laptop so that I could play a couple of my games, since my old laptop can't really play games.After reading some reviews on amazon and some articles about gaming laptops, I decided to go with this laptop.When using the laptop for hours the keypad tends to get warm but it doesn't get hot to where it burns your fingers.I can agree that the audio isn't as great as my asus laptop. It sounds like it the voices are cracking when at high volume, but at low volume (roughly between 15-30) it sounds a lot better with the game audio adjustments.I bought the 1050 4gb and the graphics are great very high def and smooth. I can play all of my games at high settings. I play mostly RPGs so it is great to have smooth graphics.When running windows programs the texts can be blurry but going on the web and playing games everything is all HD.The battery life is great when using the web or watching movies, but when it comes to gaming it could honestly use some work. It would last about 1 hour to 1 and 1/2 hours when playing a game that requires a lot of power.Overall I'm happy with my purchase, and when I added an extra 8gb RAM everything got faster when loading and the battery life was boosted a bit.
Totally kicks ass for the price. ROCK solid well built as you would expect from dell. Fit and finish are top notch. Easy access to RAM and Hard drive unlike the bargain basement rip offs at Walmart. You get what you pay for. Using for gaming and home schooling so far its excellent. EVEN with the latest patch from Intel it does not miss a beat.
Wifi quit working after 3 weeks. It would shut off and it was a pain in the a$$ to get it turned back on... then it would shut off again. Fortunatly I had not passed my 30 day period, so I returned it. Too bad Dell screwed up on such a simple issue. I really liked the laptop, but functioning wifi is essential.
I love this computer. I am in CAD heavy classes and use Solidworks, ANSYS, Blender, etc, quite frequently. I have had no issues running any graphics and processing-heavy programs or games. The startup is really fast. The fan is awesome - I can feel the laptop getting hot on my lap then the fan's kick in and the difference is incredible; it actually begins to feel cold (not even warm). The display is clear, the sound is clear. The battery lasts surprisingly long for a gaming laptop, too! I can get at least 4-5 hours on "better battery" mode (the estimate says over 7 but I'm typically never away from a power outlet that long), which was better than my last laptop. Given the price, this laptop does more than I could have hoped for. This is probably one of the best laptops I've owned.
Excellent buy. Ive own the laptop for over a month now with little to no complaints. I can only really complain about the low battery life(about 2-3 hours while gaming) and windows bloatware (personal issue). Ive been able to play the newest games on med- high settings. Would recommend this to others.
BEWARE of this product. I bought this machine back in February and have only been using it a couple of weeks. While using it the screen would start to turn white and the display would not refresh. I'd have to re-adjust the angle of the screen for it to work. This is rather annoying and frankly down right frustrating. Further to this, Amazon refuses to provide support for the defective machine. I am quite disappointed in this level of service.
This laptop is really fast.In a few seconds you're ready to go to internet or play games. The only con, the Windows 10 crashed 3 times and you need to start again the laptop, Never had this problem before with my old laptop, besides this and really recommend this model.
I LOVE IT!!!!! I am still a "Minor" so I cant really get a job but I was able to save up enough money to buy this computer I had planned on buying a custom made but I decided to also get some other stuff like a console (ps4) and some games instead so I bought this computer not expecting it to be the best but so far most of the games I play I can run on ultra graphic settings (games like skyrim special edition, the batman arkham series, and assassins creed series) the only downside to this computer is it randomly freezes every app mostly google chrome but I am having to restart the computer more times than I wish
Although it functions quite well the chassis wasn't metal, and the outter case was so poorly designed that the hinges of the screen act as levers to split it appart using nothing more than the screen's own weight. I've had to use lots of super glue just to keep it together since I cannot afford another PC. I had a toshiba laptop before this with slightly worse specs for 3 years, and only had to replace that because the charging port of the motherboard died (tried just replacing the piece but was a no go). Considering I haven't had this one even a year and it's given so much trouble (started within a month but was managabe) I can't recommend this PC if you plan on actually keeping one for any decent length of time.
Almost perfect.This laptop, as well as any other dell inspiron gaming laptop, appears to have audio issues. I've tried but there's no current solution to the distorted/crackling sound problem while using the built-in speakers.With that aside, the laptop works flawlessly. Cool graphics, CPU, RAM and ports.
I love this unit and it is at a great price with many features. I would recommend upgrading the ram for serious gaming easy to put in. The screen to me is a bit washed out but can be adjusted with effort. Overall you cannot beat price and quality highly recommended.
This is my first Gaming Laptop and I must say it is amazing. The design is great and the computer is powerful! I use the computer for work and for MMORPG. Games like Runescape and WoW run flawlessly on Ultra settings. Web surfing is a breeze and the start up of the computer takes only 5-8 seconds.
I've been using it for about 3 weeks and it has been okay thus far. It's my first Dell Laptop and with patience, I've gotten used to manually configuring settings (like changing default video graphics to make some of my software work well). Hence, if you can endure some research time to find out why somethings are not working well, then you could setup this laptop to its optima best to get the best out of it.As I noted above, I'm still getting used to it but it has been okay thus far.
What a great product and fast shipping
Gift for my son. He hasn't expressed any problems with it yet
3 days old and locking up on Witcher 3 on med settings. Not what I paid almost $1000 for.
I need urgently a ticket regarding this computer.The person Will Bering to Brazil and The document it must bÃª together with computer.You delivered it without ticket.Please provide urgently.Emailsflavia.cao@hotmail.comdisapatu@disapatu.com.brmab.33@terra.com.br
to solve the freezing issue, be sure to disable hardware acceleration in your browser/anywhere else it may be (could not find one in Video drivers, but disabling the one in chrome solved the freezing issue for me.
Bought this for my daughter to take to college. She loves it!
A great laptop for both gaming and personal use. One of the only laptops I bought that doesn't heat up if overused.
After reading so many reviews about this laptop, I was a bit sceptical about buying it, but I eventually did and I am glad I did. It is such a beauty and it's pretty fast too. The screen is not crappy like many would have you believe.
I use it to run music software i use maschine and cubase on it and i have no problems. As long as you update EVERYTHING and make sure to download the nividia drivers this thing is a beast of a laptop for the price. Not sure about gaming because i dont use it to game. But for my music production software it works great
My product had this problem after 3th time after i opened. The problem its the HD some time when i open the laptop he can t see all my G and partision of the HD!!! I was disappionted because in till now i had only Dells Ps and i did t have no problem. I tend to belive this laptop it s not original!!!
Speakers and headphones dont work. I can only hear sounds through the tv with hdmi cable plugged. I updated all the drivers but still doesnt work.
Fantastic. No Problems so far. Runs faster than I could have hoped.
Very good laptop for it's price. The only minus: display. Terrible TN screen. But no worries, the LP156WF6-SPB1 will give us a perfect laptop for work and gaming.
The laptop is good overall for the price and quality , the only missing thing is that the body IS NOT METAL as claimed in the description of amazon. I expect the quality team to verify these things before putting product desciptions...
nice product.........
Great and fast laptop. My cousin loves it.
OK product and good service
It does not have a DVD driver and it bug at the level of Sound and Image, it is a little defect of the video card ?? I'm disappointed !
Bought for my grandson to use at UCF engineering school. Meets all expectations.
Awesome computer. Very fast (about the first week it hangs a lot). Nice cooler system. Nice baterry lifeCons:-the screen it's not ok. It's a little dark and reflect a lot the light.but, in general, it's a nice computer with nice set up. I recommend.
Within a day of receiving the product, the display started freezing constantly, especially when playing a video or using any browser. Basically, it halts for anywhere from 5 to 40 seconds and seems to happen more frequently when you move from one application to another, or even between tabs on a browser. A few months in, this has not resolved at all and has gotten worse. The computer occasionally functions even more poorly than my 6 year old raggedy laptop that I was switching off of - seriously. Luckily I haven't experienced any forced shutdowns, BUT, there have been about 3-5 times when the laptop completely freezes for minutes, forcing ME to shut it down... Extremely disappointing and disgusting for what should be a decently powerful comp.Video games function well, however; if you plan to use this laptop PURELY for gaming, then it may be worth the few hundred you might save over buying a newer, more reliable version.Otherwise, go for the most updated product. This is my only experience with their gaming laptops, but Dell's general purpose products have been above average experiences for me. In this space, it seems like Dell might suck for gaming.
OMG why did I wait so long
I bought this for light gaming and school work for when I return to college. Even with the 1050 it allows me to play the strategy games I play very nicely as well as works properly with Steam's in home game streaming.
Good price, Good Computer.
Resetting time too long it takes 1 hour to reach to 33% I don't know what is this I payed almost 1000 $ to get this !!!!
Great performance. Can handle heavy graphics. Had to replace the screen on my warranty. Could have been a one time faulty case
Upgrading to a higher tier of memory would have been preferable. But all in all, very nice computer. Good solid feel to it, had many HP computers in the past that just felt flimsy.
Good system. Runs most things I have thrown at it with only a few slow downs with high settings and multitasking.
This laptop is the BOMB. Worth the price. Runs PUBG at 60 FPS, easily runs to VMs in VMware. Great replacement. Definitely got my money's worth
Purchased for general computing and light gaming, perfect for my needs! Runs Fallout 4 at 60 FPS with no issues!
Very fast, ssd up the win 10 virtually instantly, big screen, great keyboard, a laptop for day to day and running some games.
Works as expected. Great product, fast, reasonably priced, and reliable.
The computer is Beautiful design very comfortable, runs really fast . I was very disappointed with the battery life, The battery runs really fast and specially for a computer that consider is a gaming laptop .
Just Awesome! Best laptop I've ever owned! I'm on it now typing this review, lol. Super fast and a bit heavy, but that's why you get more everything!
The sound card occasionally produces choppy sound. But it works, and it plays Civ VI, so it's got that going for it.
Powerful laptop, best one i found for that price
After two months using my laptop, the hard disk is corrupted.
Runs the games I intended it for such as Fallout 4, Civilizations and Total War well on higher settings.
Great budget laptop. I replaced my high end desktop for this and i dont regret it.
Laptop works great. However, it came with several scratches on the body. Purely cosmetic but annoying.
i really like this laptop a lot it work out pretty good just like i want it to be and very nice looking
Very good so far
My laptop keyboard left button and right button did not work. I did not what happened. What should I do ?
Just ignore the bad reviews this laptop is awesome for its price
I needed an affordable laptop with good speed and so far I am very impressed with the laptop.
This machine Rocks!!!
The notebook is perfect. The only problem was that it arrived with some scratches on the cover.
The speaker sound horrible, I can barely hear the music or video playing.
Just the label sticker on the keyboard got scratched very easily
The keys are not metal as mentioned in the description, otherwise it seems good.
great laptop definitely worth the buy no problems with it and great performance
I am pretty pleased so far. But I only had this for 8hrs. I will update this review within a week or two.keyboard is backlit,speaker on the laptop it self is good.the fan gets loud for some time, my wife thought it was raining at certain time it would turn on.havent played any game on it but will be doing so and update it.Aesthetically it is sleek. The moment my wife pulled it out of the box (which ontrack just left at the front of our door without even trying to ring the bell. Even though we were inside waiting for it) I said âsleekâBut overall as of now it is enough to calm my wife.Planning on putting photoshop on it and use it everyday for her review and gamings.will do a more indeepth review later on.
I do love this leptop!
This was purchased for our daughter to be used at her school as the school required all students to have a laptop with specific capabilities.First, keys randomly fell off; all but one snapped back on. But the then the body separated in the upper left corner and literally became unhinged. This computer was not even used on a daily basis, and when not in use was in her backpack. We purchased the Asurion protection plan but I don't know if this is even repairable.
Notebook arrived fast and its working perfectly
Fantastic! That's really the only way to describe this product.
Itâs great
Good for mutitasking.
Slick, efficient and forgiving
Excellent product!!Delivery perfect.Recomend.
It Is excelent4
Even when I only use a web browser, this laptop randomly freezes 5-10 seconds every 3 minutes.It ends up being very tedious. That should not happen with a $800+ laptop. Don't waste your money.
when using it gets hang for 2-3 min.
Great laptop for gamers who don't want to spend a ton of money! However, I used Amazon Warehouse (which was significantly cheaper), and I received the i5 version. Even though this is still powerful for games, I feel a little bad. Besides that, this laptop can handle almost everything you can think of. The only negatives I could see is the limited storage (256gb ssd) and RAM (8gb). It still is a really quiet and powerful laptop though!
Nice product
First off, the laptop runs really well and runs my Steam library pretty well, and is generally pretty snappy when navigating the desktop. However, the trackpad feels a little weird/slow to me (I'll probably get used to it soon), and if the screen is tilted at the wrong angle, the lighting and colors are way off. Other than that though, it's a solid laptop, definitely an upgrade from the Lenovo Y510P that has somehow made it with me all the way through college.Really the only reason this didn't get a 5 star review is because a week after I got the computer, my I kept on getting a crash loop to the BSOD telling my I had a MEMORY_MANAGEMENT error, and I couldn't use my computer for more than 30 seconds before it crashed again. I pulled out my old laptop (I'm currently writing this review on it) and looked up how to re-seat the RAM to see if it had been jostled loose or something, but even when I switched which slot it was in I kept on having crashes due to memory. LUCKILY, my boy Mohammed over at Dell support was on the phone with me while I was messing around in the chassis and Dell is sending me a new RAM stick free of charge. I'm a little bummed I won't be using my laptop for about a week but at least the customer support is good.I still would suggest getting this laptop. Just be aware that this might be an issue, might be worth ordering another 8GB of RAM with the computer and then returning it for free later if you don't need it. Have a good one people, happy shopping.
Good item
I would say get then it's 800 dollars can't go wrong this is not a gaming laptop it can play games but it's not the best experience if you get it the display is utter trash so don't bother using this display and the SSD is low end so don't expect blazing fast profotmance but it will boot and run programs like you expected to. Here's the good stuff the build quality is really good and the laptop Is thing and light it has a 130w power supply and you can upgrade this by removing on screw on the back you can add ram replace the SSD and hard drive
while the laptop performs reasonably well, the surface material is too easily smudged. This may seem a trivial matter but i don't like the way it always looks soiled. Just touch it and your fingerprint can be clearly seen. you always have to be cleaning it!
To be honest, the worst mistake I could have made was buying this Dell computer. I searched so much on the internet, I read and they convinced me to buy this model. But it has been a total loss of money.From the beginning it was super slow, the technical support of Dell tried to help me by phone, but they did nothing. A month and a half ago it completely went out and it did not turn on anymore. Apparently all at a certain point reflect this failure. The technical support made me send it to Texas to the repair center, and there it lasted almost a month. Then It arrived last week and two days later it went off again and did not turn on, AGAIN!. I just called to make the return, because I do not want this computer anymore, how is it possible that after two days of coming "Repaired" will be damaged again ?. But they just say to send it back to repair (AGAIN) and I can not return it.Please, do not waste your money buying this computer which in itself is slow, has very poor quality and technical support.
Excellent product. As always DELL is a guarantee of quality and reliability. I am very pleased with the performance of this notebook
UPDATE: Received my replacement and it has the same exact issues.I should have listened to the other reviews. The computer lags and hangs up for 10-90 seconds at a time. I am using it mainly for school so when I'm in the middle of an online quiz, this becomes a very huge problem. I updated all the drivers, BIOS was up-to-date, disabled all the annoying bloatware and still had the same issues. I have requested a replacement. I will update my review if the replacement works better.
I have only had it up for about 2 days.All went well installing and updating windows 10. My slow internet service took about 6 hours for all the updates.The only surprise was that when doe I have 165 applications running, checking it with task manager.On my old HP Pavilion dv also a quad I run 85 applications. The HP was a windows 7 conversion to windows 10.On a Lenovo also a conversion I see about 100 applications running.The Dell was not intended for gaming, but for engineering number crunching.So far it boots from password enter to screen in about 3-4 secs. The OS drive is SSD, a Toshiba.The main drive is a Western Digital 1TB HDD, 5400 RPM, not the fastest. I was empty.Later I may swap out that for a 500GB SSD.All in all I recommend this unit. It is very fast.I can't state the gaming attributes, as I am not a gamer. Look for an update if find problems.But for now I am very pleased.It will be used for heavy software compiling and running Excel macros.Update 8/4/2017All is still working very good. The laptop is very quick. I did change out drive D: a 1TB HDD to a 500GB Crucial SSD (Amazon purchase)It was not difficult. Used the Acronis True Image that came with the SSD. The Acronis software was a little confusing but worked. Suggest you watch You Tube videos showing and explaining use.The Dell recognized the cloned SSD just fine. I had to rename drive back to D:Also used Windows to relocate the Documents folder to drive D: Worked perfectly.It appears the SSD has increased battery life to 14hrs plus at idle.Very happy with this laptop used as a engineering work station.
Everyone saying the display is horrible, it is not that bad. The screen works for my uses (Work/School), I am not a graphics designer or anything.I did add patriot viper memory upping it to 32 GB. I would have been fine with 16GB.Used for 2 months now.
Yes it's fast with some programs but this computer lags every 10 seconds, if you have multiple windows open. Despite being quad core it can't handle multiple windows, and I'm talking 2 or 3... I can't switch back from powerpoint to my pdf reader without lagging or freezing for 2-3 seconds. Its getting tiresome. I got this laptop for processing videos, if you're just using video editing software it works fine. But if you need to get files online it will lag while switching screen. The speaker on this computer is TERRIBLE, it breaks up if it's too loud, almost like mechanical vibration sound.I rarely give out bad review because I generally read review before I buy them, but this time I got shafted. I'm considering returning it but it has I already installed all the softwares and its a hassle. I'm writing this because I'm working on my school work and it keeps lagging, I think it's because I'm listening to music while I'm searching online. This compute can't even handle that. i can't write anymore, because it already lagged billion times.TLDR: 1. speaker really bad, like really really. 2. This quadcore doesn't mean anything, can't even handle 2 chrome windows opened. 3. It runs single program fine, but it starts lagging like crazy if you have powerpoint and pdf with youtube on.
Good performance.Heats up quickly on consuming GPU.
I HAVE IT SINCE A MONTH AND I DONT HAVE ANY PROBLEM. I JUST CHANGE THE OS TO W10 PRO. THE DELL OFFICIAL PAGE HAVE ALL THE DRIVERS SO HAVE ANY PROBLEM. I'M A NOT AN USSUAL GAMER BUT RUNS GTA V AND FORZA 3 WITH THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION. ACTUALLY I'M USING TO EDIT SOME VIDEOS AND ACCOUNTING PROGRAMS.
Excellent laptop so far. Have two issues with build (i) keyboard keys are red, and for a color blind person like me it all blends; and (ii) a little bit bulky but that's what's expected for a gaming rig so it is an issue, but not one to be mad about.System came as advertised, I read before the order that there were some issues with the specs not matching up to as described on the website but it was legit. Getting some games now, about to buy GoW 4 and Battlefield 1 to test out the performance but the benchmarks are pretty solid so far.
Nothing but problems with the motherboard after a month of purchase. I've been trying to work with Dell to get it fixed and it has been fruitless. Will not buy again.
Like my new computer, works well.
Using chrome on this computer can be lagged. Besides, there is an issue when you use external screen via HDMI cable. I reinstall windows and remove messy stuff installed in the laptop. It looks good now.
Good product and good price delivered on time as promised.
This laptop is like the title says great for beginners or travelers. I also am a student and will use it for class. This is the perfect size and runs games like battlegrounds, WOW, and grand theft auto5 fine. This is my second one, the first one I received had a pressure mark on the lower left side of the screen. I immediately returned it back to amazon and had a new tracking number for a new laptop within a few hours. I received the new laptop within 2 days and it was perfect. Amazon and th product gets 5 stars.
The laptop make a strange noise.
love it so far.....
DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL!!! They are defective, faulty, and broken. The first one I got kept restarting everytime I turned it on and giving me the blue screen, I just assumed that one in particular was broken so I went and ordered a replacement. The same exact thing happened the same day I got my replacement! This model is faulty, 2 broken laptops sent to me within a week is NOT a coincidence. This was supposed to be a replacement for my broken work laptop, I lost a lot of money and time because of this piece of garbage. Please, save yourself the stress and time and buy a different laptop. I don't want anybody to have to deal with the stress of it like I was forced to. I did everything I could to make it work, but you can't fix a defective product.
#NAME?
I have a couple of problems with this laptop so far. For one thing, the fan comes on very frequently and it runs very loudly. It comes on even while I'm just browsing the internet. In fact, it's blowing quite loudly right now as I write this review. The second issue I'm having with it is that the internet glitches occasionally and it'll freeze up. For instance, while I've been typing this review it froze up but I kept typing and about 7-8 seconds later it caught up with what I had typed...several times now (in less than 5 minutes). It can't be my internet provider, I very rarely had this happen to me on my previous Lenovo laptop.UPDATE: I bumped it up from 2 stars to 3 since I found out how to fix the slow browser issue. If anyone has a similar problem with Chrome on Windows 10, try this: Click the "Customize and control Google Chrome" button in the top right; go to "Settings"; scroll down and select "Show advanced options"; scroll way down and un-check "Use hardware acceleration when available". Haven't had a problem since.
Fast and powerful, high performance/price ratio!
Great deal for a decent computer
Starting off this computer is just great, the look the performance, everything. But after only a week I started getting major alerts and blue screens demanding attention. Now this would scare a lot of people off and for good reason; however, if you know literally anything about computers you can easily work around or even FIX them with relative ease. This computer can run Overwatch at 120 fps and dark souls 3 at 90 so over all I would say this computer is way way way worth it!
Dont buy this laptop, the hinges are broken
Excellent computer, and the right price.
After 3 months the AC adapter port broke free of its mounted position and moved 1/8th inch deeper into the laptop so the AC adapter could no longer make contact. Now I have to tear the case open to charge it.GARBAGE
i bought this as my first gaming laptop since i travel and would like something to game on the way, i would recommend this to anyone who would travel or is on a budget i mainly play csgo, payday2, etc and i get around 250 fps medium settings with certain settings
Well first off, the screen is not great, the graphics should be the Ti version which would greatly improve performance, other then that it has a nice keyboard, decent trackpad, performance wise it could use the 1050ti variant to improve slightly for $800 it isn't too bad.
Absolute garbage. It arrived broken and unable to play video streaming or local without freezing. Shipped it to Dell and was without a computer for a week and it came back still broken. This is a GAMING LAPTOP and it cannot play videos. Now they want me to ship it to them, my only computer I have for work, and be without a computer for AT LEAST ANOTHER WEEK.If I had a time machine, I would go back in time and not order this and kick myself for wanting to order it in the work place.Again, absolute garbage.
The laptop was great. My mother broke the screen in week 2. It took 9 separate customer service individuals to finaly get a new part ordered. Dell let me order the part then 8 days later told me they didnt have it. Asked to be mailed when part was in stock and they acted like That was a strange request they might not be able to pull off. Never got an email. Mom went entire summer with NO Computer... unacceptable. Horrible service from Dell, and they dont care. I could not understand the speach of 3 of the 9 customer service representatives, and asked 4 of them specifically to have someone in upper management contact me by phone or email and no one ever has cared to address how unsatisfied I am. Dell? Never again.
Computer's audio failed on day 1, and for the week I owned it would randomly play static. It took about 20 minutes to startup whenever I rebooted it, and it couldn't even run Youtube without sporadically freezing. The Inspiron series has been amazing overall so I hope that these problems were purely in a defective model I recieved, but nonetheless I can't recommend this on the basis that there is a chance the computer will clearly not work.
Great looking laptop. The screen resolution is very good (not fuzzy). Pretty light for the size. Keyboard is fantastic. I bought this for video and photo editing but as other review says, this freezes (like 10 sec lag) very often. Even watching regular youtube is problem. Im not an expert but def this happens EVERY TIME the browser is open for regular browsing and video watching. This "gaming" computer shouldn't have such glitches out of box. Period. This is brand new and this has nothing to do with BIOS. I had so far 7 Dells and Dell quality is always doubtful. It's hit or miss but always something goes wrong. If this is happening for across the board, def something is wrong.. It froze 5 times while writing this short review.[update] a fellow gave me tip about the Chrome fix. After trying that, it seems like everything is ok. But will have to see. Thank you for the tip!
Headset Jack does not work. You must buy a USB adapter to use a headset (single jack) like the ones you use on a smartphone, that work for both microphone and headphone. This simply doesnt work. I have also had issues with the video card not working properly. Screen is very dim. I would upgrade to one with a IPS screen, this one is very dark.. The mousepad (touch pad) is very buggy. It constantly registers right clicks as left clicks.
I had received this model with damaged hdd. my hdd (1Tb) doesnt work correctly.
I would give this a 5 stars for the great gaming experience you get for the price, but when I first started using it there was a horrible crackling noise coming out of the subwoofer on the bottom. I did a bunch of driver updates and turned the speakers off but it still kinda does it. I was on customer support for almost 2 hours and they were really good but they ended up telling me I needed to ship it back to get fixed. Apparently not everyone has this problem but I did, so it gets 3 stars instead of 5.
The laptop itself is good. High performance but the problem is its not an "Intel i7 7th Gen". Another Problem is the battery drains so fast when playing games such as DoTa2. The Built-In Fan (im so sorry i dont know what you called that) seems not working properly unless you make the back side of the laptop elevated. The speakers is good and i have no problem with that. The black version is easy to scratch and your finger prints will be surely all over once you touched it. The graphics is good, it perfectly runs games smoothly.My sugesstion is buy this PC if youre an MMORPG gamer or an FPS. Dont buy this if you love to play MOBA games, because an regular match on MOBA games last 60 min and it will already drain 40% - 50% of your battery.*I lost my old amazon account thats why you cant see the verified purchase logo (or something)*
I purchased this LAptop, and I can access only 100gb instead of 1TB. how do I make use of the 1TB, that is if it exists at all
Features that wow:Price vs value equation due to discrete Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics processorUpgraded i7 Kaby Lake with less heat, lower power consumptionFast boot with 128 G SSD hard driveGood screen with low light leakageRed backlit full size keyboard with number padUnderstated styling (low bling), but enough to be happyBright TN screenRelatively solid build, soft touch plasticsLow fan noise even under loadRelatively low weight at 5 lbsFeatures that are less impressive:Plastic everywhereSound is averageDell is not known for making its own Dell branded computer gaming powerhousesâfor that you have to jump up in price and bling to Alienware. With Dellâs dedicated Alienware brand you get lots of bells and whistles, including molded style metal cases, very solid builds, full lighting controls, generally nice specs and higher prices. Why change near mid cost perfection with the same case and essentially same innards as the prior i7559 build? This current computer is almost the same with the better Kaby Lake chip set and mostly the same Nvidia GTX1050 (vs GTX 960m). Styling wise the Inspiron is not Alienware, but with some nice red accents on the rear facing under screen grill and a red Dell logo on the lid, the Inspiron distinguishes itself as not your fatherâs Dell. [Full disclosure, having owned and upgraded from the prior Alienware M11X R3 laptop along with an i7559, I do love Alienware laptops.]First, Kaby Lake intel i7 chipset represents one of the best solutions to lower heat, lower power consumption with higher performance than the prior generation. Same for the Nvidia GTX1050âwhich performance wise during gaming, produces less heat and uses less power for similar performance (if not slightly higher in actual use!) than the prior equivalent graphics processer GTX960. This means that a gaming laptop can be built without it being a vacuum cleaner or jet engine for heat control at load. The current Kaby Lake i7 chip is highly acceptable and powerful enough to run just about anything you can toss.The 128 G SSD comes loaded with Windows 10 and it is suggested to jump immediately to updates at Microsoft and Dell for the latest drivers. [I moved immediately to W10-Creators and had no issues.] I was hoping that under the rear screw panel there might be room for removal of the 1T disc based 5200 RPM HD for replacement with an SSD, but no such luck. I suppose it could be done but it was not turnkey like a couple of prior iterations of this same laptop case. Startup is quick with the main operating system on the 128G SSD, at less than 30 seconds under normal circumstances. The 1T hard drive operates acceptably with Steam game files and other data in place.So Kaby Lake i7 and Nvidia GTX1050 is a perfect lower cost, lower heat alternative and partner with improvements over prior Skylake â?GTX960 combo? Yes it is. No, it is not a GTX1060-70-80, each with progressively faster game frame rates, and higher quality settings during gaming, but most will find the 1050 a good alternative to higher prices. Gamers should and would question if the GTX1050 will play the games they want to playâand the 1050 may have limits depending on the game. For the games I play the most, I can report full functionality with high settings and Physix running on high settings for all the Borderlands series games, Fallout 4, and DOOM on this capable Dell Inspiron. While I cannot report on actual FPS, there is no obvious slowdowns in full action movement for these games. This laptop does like to be plugged in for game play at these levels, which I am used to from prior laptops. If you are not plugged in, you may have some movement and frame rate stutters in more demanding games at higher settings. The Nvidia 1050 provides low heat output at load. This Dell runs quiet with no audible fan noise at normal loads and tasks. When pushed during gaming the fan is audible but is very quiet so you would not necessarily need headphones during game play.The keyboard itself is good with a bit of play and solid feeling but no noticeable flex. Not mechanical but adequate. It is friendly to gaming and touch typing with full size keys and a nice number pad. Red LED lighting can be turned off or dimmed.The 15.6-Inch FHD TN screen has wide viewing angles, is very bright, and good color representation. As an improvement over the prior 7559 version, this sample does not have any border light leakage.Mouse pads are a sore point with many. The use of single surface pads is happening more and more, and often a source of issues. Having a work based ThinkPad, with a mostly unusable integrated pad, I always jump to a dedicated mouse. The Dell Inspironâs pad is a bit better with mostly positive and separated sections for âright/leftâ?buttonsâalthough the offset may not appeal to all. Of course, if you are buying this laptop for gaming, you are already going to use a dedicated mouse.Sound quality is acceptable with good stereo separation, although the subwoofer is certainly not earthshaking. Strangely enough, out of the box, some diagnostic work was required and drivers had to be reinstalled due to no sound. Admirably, Windows made this simple with a quick restart.So, should you buy this laptop? Personally, for the games I play and the tasks I do, this is a great laptop for the price, albeit not âperfectâ?. You should consider what games you may play and read additional reviews regarding the suitability of the Nvidia GTX1050 for your own uses prior to jumping to any system that has similar specs. Great value and recommended.
The power cord came apart on this computer, finally to the point that it will no longer charge the battery. It is not covered by Dell warranty even though the computer is less than a year old. In short, the warranty on this computer is absolutely worthless. Apparently, you have to buy a separate policy to cover the adapter, which is good for Dell, since the adapter, made in China, is of very pull quality if it loosens apart after a month to expose wires. It is probably also dangerous. If you don't care about worthless warranties, go ahead and buy this computer, but not that Dell does not stand behind its products. Then when I was told I would buy the adapter from Amazon and not give Dell any more of my money, I have been subjected to constant harassment from Dell people to explain to me how unreasonable I am to have expected that the warranty included the adapter.
Less than a year old, very lightly used, and the case is falling apart. By lightly used, I mean that it stays in one room, and we use it for netflix, and of course, amazon prime, etc. The power cord wires are separating, and the lid is ready to fall apart. Bought another one just like it, for my son for school, and it has not fared as well.Read all the reviews of how this is just a bad design, so we are not the only people with this problem.Really, this is what happens when a brand is going down. Start building junk, and then blame the customer that they are not opening the lid in the right way, so the screws are falling out. (forgetting to mention that the screws are very small, few, with no loctite.)For me, not a big problem. I have HP laptops that are a few years old and still work great. I just feel sorry about all the people who saved up to buy this machine and are not stuck with a lemon.SHAME.
It has been less than a year when I ordered this laptop. Its such a bad design. The hinge is all broken, the screen is just falling.I ordered two laptops, and I am facing same issue with other one too. I had to glue in to get it work.Go for some other model.
So far i'm impressed with this laptop. I have not run a game on it yet but all web pages only take about 4 seconds to load tops. The fan for this is also dead quiet. one thing that is disappointing, my wireless mouse does not work on the very smooth surface of this laptop. My old dell was textured and it worked fine. The only surface it will work on is the built in mouse itself. Also when i'm on YouTube and I start a video it does a 5 second glitch fest when starting and ending a video. I think its just starting computer hiccups. One thing that I really like is the back-lit keyboard. Iv'e never had one and now that I do it's super cool. I do hope dell looks at this review about the wireless mouse not working. that was a bummer because now ill have to cut out a mouse pad to it's shape and if I leave it in the laptop wont close and it's gonna be really annoying to carry a round. I hope I find more amazing things about this laptop as I explore.========================================UPDATE============================================================I am becoming displeased with this laptop. I was trying to play a game called Stardew Valley (AMAZING GAME by the way) and whenever I had to shut it to do something else the screen would freeze and I would have to restart it, losing all my progress since last save. and sadly in stardew valley there isn't any save button. I'm in limbo If I should return it And get a new one or what.
This is one sleek laptop. It has some good specs for a gaming laptop at a price more affordable than most in its category.The laptop boots up quickly and the design and build are top quality. I love the backlit keyboard and this gets decent battery life even when gaming.The one thing that really stands out to me though is just how loud it is. Unless I wear a headset, the fan can get very distracting. I will note that I rarely have music or TV on when I am on my laptop so if you tend to have Spotify or Pandora playing in the background you may not notice it as much.But I love the power and looks of it and it is a good value for a gaming laptop.
It's a good gaming laptop,I have been using this for a month,It's gaming performance is amazing and I've played battlefield 1 (High settings: 45 to 55 FPS ;Medium settings: Solid 60 FPS) and NFS: Rivals and Batman Arkham knight works smooth and I'm sure it can handle current games at medium to high graphics settings very wellPros:* It's boot time takes around 8 to 10 seconds*It's Touch pad is excellent*Black lit keyboard with red print is good* Stereo speakers and subwoofer audio is perfect compare to my old dell laptop*laptop fan is so quiteCons:* Over heating during gaming* TN FHD panel
lags while using chrome and video editing worst laptop.
This laptop is goood ! The processor is quite fast, it just takes a few seconds to load when the laptop is turned on. It has quite good storage space and the battery is enough for people who play games as well as work. It has a battery better than most of the gaming laptops. Keys are good. Don't expect the speakers to be excellent. The speakers create an echo. The display is good. Since it's a TN panel, you need to set the correct angle first, but once you're done with it, it's quite good. And for people who have lots of work on Skype or any other video calling app, the front camera is also good. Don't expect it to be as good as your phone's front cam, but in comparison to other webcams I've seen, you can call this one great. And yes the charging speed of this laptop is superb. People say it's too heavy and it's not slim, but does it really matter ?! The main thing is the performance, if the performance and processor is good, then your laptop can function well for years. I've done a lot of survey before buying this laptop (as it is my first laptop) and trust me you cant get a better laptop at this price (800$).
Worst screen ever. Cant believe that dell is shipping with these panels in 2017, they look like they are from old tv sets from the 80s with false colors. With a warm tint that cant be changed at all, gives you a headache if you stare for few minutes. Im planning to replace it with my 5 years old xps laptop 720p screen. Regret the purchase.
Would be a great laptop, if it had come out of the box right. I ordered this item directly from dell, and when it arrived I was less than happy with the condition of my over $1,000 config of the device. First off I noticed that the hinge that holds the display onto the rest of the body of the machine was off-center, which caused there to be an overhang on the right side of the display. Then when I went to plug it in to boot it up - just to see if the display worked properly - I noticed the power brick's rubber belt for cable management was broken.Fortunately, Dell has pretty good customer service and a new one is on it's way. I'll update this review when I get the new one in about 8 days. I'm just glad I didn't need the thing now, otherwise I'd be a lot angrier right now...I didn't order this product from amazon, nor is this my config, but I'm posting this review here because these hardware and accessories issues could happen to any model of the 7000 series gaming.
Pros:- Excellent givens its price- Good performance and nice appearance for a budget gaming laptop- Long battery lifeCons:- When playing intensive games the fan can get very loud and it can get hot enough to where you can feel the heat on parts of the keyboard- The HDD where you will keep your games is kinda slowNote: The screen looks good only at certain angles.
I bought this laptop brand new. After the first week, the charger came apart where the clear plastic blue light connects. Now, the wires are sticking out of the charger and have a potential for causing an electrical fire. I called customer service and they say it is not covered by the warranty that it comes with and I would need to have to buy a new one. This company does not stand behind their products and apparently have no regards for fire safety. This is not a simple wear an tear issue for a computer I have owned for less than a year.
Boots fast and plays the games I've tested on it with relative ease. Overall decent laptop but the speakers and screen leave a bit more to be desired
Case is coming apart like everyone else's. Currently using duct tape as it 's not worth truly fixing it. Kind of sad because it's a very sleek laptop, but very poor build quality with cheap plastic.
So I bought this thing about a year ago and forgot to review it but I hope this helps. It's a great laptop all around great performance for gaming and all around use. I play games on it to this day and it runs better than some of my friend's desktops. And I know this is cheaper than their setups. So yeah if you're thinking about buying if highly recommend.
The laptop came with hardware and software issues and the replacement sent back also had the same issues. The system stutters and lags every time, i stream or play videos!!
This laptop has run wonderfully so far! I would rate it higher, except when I first received this laptop the graphics card quit working after the first week. Luckily Dell support was very helpful and replaced the whole graphics card/motherboard combo. Haven't had a problem since, and I have tested a few current video games on it just to be sure.
I bought this computer a few months ago, and I've had many problems with it. First thing is that the fan turns on way to frequently, even when I'm browsing the internet; to top it off, it's very loud. Secondly, the display is pretty bad. Don't even talk about the frame rate. Also, physically, the parts are so brittle, I dropped it on my couch and half of the plastic things in front of the fan fell off. I had to spend a lot of money repairing that. Overall, if you are looking for a new computer, I don't recommend this one.
This laptop is really loud. The fans are so loud that my classmates were looking at me crazy.
I want to buy this.
DO NOT BUY. Dell was great back in 2010. they have gone down hill since. DO NOT BUY. I loved dell and they always did me great until recently. I spent $900 on a touch taptop and it stopped working after a year and 2 days. They were the worst customer service after the 1 year warrenty. Wouldnt do a thing. Had so much faith in dell until now. they set their computers to fail when the warranties are up. DO NOT BUY.
Bought mine in mid-2015, and after 1.5 years of gentle use, the hinge got too stiff and broke the interior plastic. Now evertime I dare open my laptop, the metal base of the hinge pops up and literally pulls part of the laptop apart.This was a $800 investment in Dell's quality, wasted. DO. NOT. BUY. DELL. LAPTOPS!!!
The computer was a lemon. It was sent back and forth by Dell for weeks on end, never once resolving the issues. The warranty that comes with Amazon purchases is mail-in only, with 12 day wait times each go, and you pay out of pocket for shipping. They simply swapped the hard drive each time because it passed the cut-rate self diagnostic tool that Dell puts on your BIOS as bloatware. This machine was amazing when it ran for the first few weeks. But once it died, it got stuck ina fial to boot cycle, and I got stuck in a fail to fix cycle with Dell Support. Will never buy another Dell again. This was a terribly unreliable product, and the only thing worse is how terrible Dell support was.
Windows 10 is crap. You would think that Microsoft Windows would work seamlessly with Microsoft Office. Nope. This is my 2nd computer with Windows 10 that I have returned. I use another Microsoft product - Office. Windows 10 will not work with my Microsoft Office 2010 Outlook. I can't connect to my email server. On the positive side, Amazon let me return this with complete understanding about my frustration.
I've received this laptop with problems! It was really a bad buy...
Bought this laptop for work. Runs great so far, had it for about a month. Really wanted this because of the SSD and the quick startup capabilities. I regularly run quite a few windows at the same time and havenât had any problems yet. Only thing negative I can say is that the touchpad is a little finicky and I wish it had a backlit keyboard (my fault for not researching it enough). I use this with a docking station so the touchpad is not really an issue though.
Jeez, where to start. Of the 12-13 laptops I've had over the last 30 or so years this one is by far the most annoying. It is virtually unusable with Windows 10. As soon as you try to move the cursor in any direction either a dialog box pops up, or a pull down menu or the text size changes or the most annoying thing I've ever had the displeasure of having thrust on me, Windows personal annoyance, Cortana. Click on a button or hyperlink and it launches Cortana. Hit a pulldown menu, it launches Cortana. I've tried multiple times to change the sensitivity of the touch pad to no avail. There is no way to completely turn Cortana off, either. There's no way I'm fighting that crap for the duration of the lifetime of this machine.The keyboard is cheesy and types horribly, even for a laptop. Very disappointed, Dell. This one is a swing and a miss. Returning this garbage today
excellent product
These are not new dell computers! they have removed the 500 gig hard drive and replaced with a 256gig ssd drive and loaded win 10 pro
So far so good, this is a great little computer. I use it mostly for work, I'm a remote implementer for a software company.
This computer for the money is real fast and the colors are so bright
GENERALLY GOOD - BUT DID NOT WANT TO CONNECT TO OFFICE WIFI
Computer is very fast with the SSD it comes with. Not a fan of the touchpad. Very nice display and having Bluetooth is a big plus. Overall a very nice computer for the price.
I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. She has put Sims, and the expansion packs on the laptop and it works great!
This computer was FULL of bloatware. EBAY, Netflix, Priceline and other obnoxious applications. After going through and deleting all the crap, I am happy with this laptop. It is still running a bit slower than I imagine it should, but I'm going to have my brother-in-law check my apps again and help me with it.
Setup took some hours, but thats Microsoft, not Acer. Runs fine. Not lightning fast but definitely an affordable upgrade from where I was. Task manager took 3 seconds to open...not sure what that other reviewer is talking about. Laptop construction feels a little cheap, but you get what you pay for. Fan is audible but not loud. Will have to remove bloatware tonight though there doesnt seem to be a lot. If youre buying this for gaming you should also look for an external graphics card cause the built in one wont handle much if you want newer games.
I bought this laptop for my husbands birthday. He had issues with the update which took FOREVER. He complained about it being extremely slow (please note our WIFI speed is 110 MBPS) heâs had to do a hard reboot several times and still is not working properly.Heâs not wanting to send it back but we may have to.
For Home and lite work related tasks this Acer exceeds expectations. At 4.6 lbs it easily moves around the most common workspaces at home and we are satisfied with build quality out of the box. 5 to 6 hour battery life is about right at this point. This is the Acer 3 with specs as advertised.
Bear in mind that the windows 10 does not come installed.you have to install it and it took me a solid 3 hours.but this laptop is perfect for basic needs.
I had to return mine as defective. Very long boot-up time, and it would frequently get hung up on different web pages with no rhyme or reason. Screen frequently froze up and was not responsive to mouse pad or standard mouse. Overall, a big disappointment.
Do not buy this product. I bought it despite the negative reviews and based solely on the price and what I thought was decent performance. This computer is slow, unresponsive and seems to have been infected with malware and recommissioned and sold as new. Do yourself a favor and if you're going to invest in a laptop don't invest solely on price. I have been trying to download an app from the windows store (Windows Scan) so I can scan tax forms to complete my taxes. Its been 25 minutes and the download has not even moved from 1%. It takes 2 minutes to open Google chrome to the homepage of Google. I have 100 mb/s internet speed so it's definitely not my internet. My tablet, phones, Xbox and firestick work great on the internet. This computer simply can't do basic functions in a halfway timely manner. I am completely disappointed with it. Do not buy.
Insanely Slow, i was doing work on my phone faster then this. Returned it right away. Constant crashing while installing programs, and they took forever to install. Just spend a lil more for a better laptop and save your self the trouble
It has a nice look and started up well. I had to take it in to a tech guy to clean up though, it comes with a ton of bloatware and was hardly usable. The very first time I tried to use it, I was just paying bills. It took me about 30 minutes to pay 3 bills and I gave up. It was ridiculous. My tech friend was able to remove the bloatware by taking it back to factory settings and not allowing certain things to run on start-up. Works fine now.
This laptop was a great purchase. It has all of the features that we needed for our employee and was very easy to setup. I would highly recommend buying from this company. The employee that received the computer was very happy with the sleekness as well as the speed of the laptop.
Bang for your buck, it's a great little basic computer. Was never a big AMD processor fan in comparison to Intel, but this A9 is decent.Have to admit my son uses it for gaming and SIMPLE animation, but for mild tasking it's been solid.
This is a huge step up from the small Lenovo I was using. Plenty of power for my needs, and plenty of storage.There were quite a few unnecessary programs that I deleted, but I haven't had a problem yet.
Dead on arrival and Iâm very displeased that perhaps shipping carrier mishandled it as this is fully integrated system and any banging of it would cause issues. I attempted to call acer and itâs nothing to do with power cord. Itâs internals. So I cannot say if the computer is fast or slow since itâs dead. Iâll update in few days.
I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, but she told me that she was having problems opening up âmy computerâ? It would freeze when she tried to access it and she would have to restart the computer every time. Not to mention the slow boot up as well. Sent it back the next day and my money was returned to me the next following day.
Good value for price. Took a while for updates. Unfortunately, had to return as machine gave BSOD before I could gift.
It seems to be a nice laptop but it is somewhat slower than my other Acer, which is a few years old.
This works straight out of the box with an easy to use set up. I don't what some of these other people are talking about, I've had no issues yet.
I hate to give bad reviews but this laptop was not a great find. Hopefully, ours was just a fluke but when we opened it up and turned it on it began 'updating' and took forever. Then when I turned it back on it did not want to boot up, again took forever. It was slow and bogged down. We sent it back. I'm thinking there was something seriously wrong with this unit.
The one thing I DO NOT LIKE is that it shuts itself down to update and then restarts without warning. I have yet to figure out how to control that, as I have done in the settings what I am supposed to do. For all I know, it could be Windows doing that. With previous computers, I would get asked about installing updates, whether to do it then OR do it later. Not with this -- at least at the present time.
This laptop is much slower than my previous acer. I thought I was buying a newer version of the one I had. If you spend some time tweaking this laptop and make sure it is updated, it is not a total disappointment.
I bought this laptop as like new, and I received a good as new. It has not DVD or CD. The proccesor is amazing AMD A9. It has bluetooth, wifi, etc. The webcam has a very low resolution. Is very light weight. The screen is real good and video card is pretty decent. The ac adapter cable is very thin, need to be careful with it. The price was amazing $276. I would recommend this if you are looking for a low price/great specs laptop
I hate that the cord is on the right side. Every other cord has always been on the left. It has to go over my legs when it's on my lap. Also, there are no lights to show that the CAP locks is on or the Num Lock. What computer doesn't have lights for that??
I got this computer for college school work and very basic computer programming related to school. I havenât used it for games yet, but I anticipate it should run well. If you buy this, let it have a day to fully install all updates. Trust me. It will take a while. There is a way to skip this process, but I donât remember the steps right now.
Bought this as a used but good condition item and it was truly in good condition. My daughter loves it!
Even though I was aware when I purchased it, the lack of a built in DVD player has been a pain. Other than that I'm happy with it.
I of course read all the reviews. Most tell you about the updates out f the box. It is true. BUT afterwards a little while you have an awesome laptop ! no problems and works great.
Great buy....speed, memory and style. I ended up on the right side of a purchase with this. Highly recommend.
Son suggested this. Works just like it says and I need.
Excellent laptop, this is my fourth ACER I've purchased and I'm pleased with their products. Windows 10 is awful though.
Item is as described
First the main board went out (in less than 3 months), Acer took care of it...I had to pay the $40 shipping.Now there is another issue (we have had laptop since Christmas) and Acer is giving me the run around.
For such a high spec computer, very disappointed. Locks up regularly, cannot handle more than 1 function without locking. Gives the reason as "driver error" every time. You would think that the drivers would be have been checked out for compatibility with the rest of the machine.
great laptop , fast as a hiccup
Works fine at the office with documents, spreadsheets and more
Everything seems to be running right. Took TWO days to download and install all updates, but it's best to do it in the beginning.
I brought two of the for my two 10 year old kids for Christmas. They like to play some online games that cant be accessed with a phone or tablet so I brought them each one. They do not like these as they are too slow. They do access the internet and have Microsoft 10 which takes about 7 hours to load, so if you are giving it as a gift to your kid I suggest opening it and downloading it so they dont have to wait. They dont use them much because of its performance. I will be looking to a way to speed them up or just get a completely different computer. Also note: the price dropped ove $50 when I checked the price in February compared to when I brought. I was very unhappy I could have saved over $100 by waiting a few weeks but how can you tell kids to wait on the main item they asked for Christmas. Acer is also discontinuing its portal very soon as well.
Constantly restarts even when all the drivers are updated.
Service was good. Received fast. But had to return. The keyboard stopped working. But until then was a good computer
Horrible experience...the laptop took forever to load up...sometimes it didnât load at all!Iâm very disappointed!!!
Product could barely run basic functions i.e. internet explorer, download applications, etc. customer service was as poor as the product.
This is really slow and Is such a pain, my 5 year old computer this was supposed to replace works better ð£
Excellent and really fast... Gooe choice
Very good product. Happy so far with everything...speed, sound, performance. Good laptop.
I miss the free games, And I am not really fond of Windows ten. It is slower than my ten yer old computer.
It seems to be a great computer for the price!
It does the job but it takes many hours to up load it.
I was very pleased when it arrived one of the laptops I have had in a while ...
Has a screen flicker every now and then.
This is a crummy computer. As soon as I started it up and began setting it up, it said it needed to do a major update for windows 10, and it would take hours. Three hours later it said it couldn't load the updates because there were corrupted files. I get my internet through satellite and pay $95 month, and this piece of crap used 1/4 my monthly allowance. Then it tried again and failed, another $25 worth of download time wasted. This was all happening in the background, and suddenly I realized I had been throttled back by my satellite company and had to buy additional time just to stay online. That cost me another $50, and this crap machine kept burning it up. So I went in and disabled the Win10 update app. Next time I turned it off and back on it went into a loop, you guessed it, trying to install updates, failed shutting down, then trying to install updates, failed, then shutting down. Non stop never booted up again. Try calling the ACER help line and you will get someone who can barely speak English. I called 4 times and had to hang up because there was no one capable of speaking clearly. Horrible computer from a crummy company that hires idiots who can't even speak the language, DONT BUY I returned mine and will never buy an ACER product again.
A bit slow of a processor
This seems to be a really good computer, download and updates took about a hr. to set up. My sonlikes to play the online game roblox and he said it worked awesome.
Though I bought this in November, 2017 I only opened the box yesterday. It took about 7 hours to download everything, but maybe that is normal. I don't really know. So far it works OK.What I really want to point out is that there is NO DISC DRIVE on this model. I had assumed (silly me) that all computers came with one.
Sadly i bought this item for myself and my sister for Christmas, we thought these laptops would be an excellent offer. Unfortunately they're not, as many other users will agree as well it takes many hours in order to boot up and several hours to actually function properly. The response time in order to open up applications and programs, even a web browser, let alone Youtube videos too take more than an actual minute.I am very disappointed
This computer is garbage and slow as molasses. Not worth the money or headache.
I had purchased this computer for my husbands birthday and it took forever to arrive. When the box was finally delivered it had been tore open on one side. There was no packaging inside the box to buffer the computer so it was banging around inside the shipping box.Just like other reviewers, the computer took forever to download the required programs, and once downloaded the computer ran extremely slow and all the applications took forever to open. It had to reconfigure the C drive twice, TWICE, for a brand new computer!Do not purchase, this is the worst computer I have ever purchased.Also, buyer has to pay for return shipping!Not at all happy with this purchase.
so far so good, I don't like the drive one program, to many of the same upgrades
Purchased this as a bday gift for my daughter. Update took hours,, then it worked great for about 4 hours, but then locked up multiple times and had to hard restart several times. Very disappointing. Amazon customer service was very helpful and gave me a refund the next day with free return shipping.
I have had it for a week. Initial updates took an entire night but no big deal. The fan running constantly is annoying. I worry about it breaking because it seems to be working so hard. The computer has restarted mid-use on me twice for no reason. I'm considering returning it based on the first week.
love it
Fantastic quality. Was "Used-Like New" but looks and runs like it's brand new.
Might be the slowest laptop ever made.
This computer crashed and reboot every 4-5 hours for no reason. Works great when in use. I really don't know what cause the crash.
Never seen a laptop so slow, it's the worst computer I've ever had. This product is garbage.
Unusable out of the box. Incredibly slow, took 15 minutes to open Task Manager. Had to hard boot several times. Returned.
Can't be beat for the price.
Purchased as gift to replace older laptop. Wife loves it!
So far so good. New i7-8550u process with 16GB of ram and SSD make a noticeable difference in my day to day work. Build quality is solid. Microsoft software updates and intrusions get more and more annoying but that isn't Dell's fault... I was hesitant to go with the 13.3" screen but the 1920 resolution at this screen size is actually fine.
Awesome deal. For this price, you get a lot. It has a nice keyboard with decent travel on the keys, powerful specs, a nice working active pen and touch screen, and an overall nice build quality. I wish the casing was aluminum, but for this price, hard plastic is tolerable.
Wrong Description - it is Dell Inspiron - 5000 series. 8 gb ram. another 8gb was added by seller not by Dell. It looks nothing like Dell Inspiron -7000. It looks fake. I wouldn't recommend.
I'm in love with it. I wanted a very portable laptop but was afraid of it being too small. With this model, I barely feel that it is an 13" screen. Its build is pretty solid and has a very affordable price tag since it comes with 16GB ram and intel core i7 8550u. In my country, a laptop with these and other specs cost like 300 to 400 bucks more or less. Is ironic that buying it at amazon and even paying a delivery company internatinal shipping fee, is way cheaper than buying it at home.The tablet option comes pretty handy when using media. I can only complain about storage capacity but I can survive with a portable hard disk and cloud storage services.
Great laptop, keyboard is reponsive and no issues with having to press the keys harder, backlit keyboard is nice, screen is sharp and makes it easy on the eyes, love to feature where it goes yellow at night. Only annoyance is the placement of the power button where a few times well I turned it off/on by mistake. But wonderful laptop overall.
I was about to return because it was heating up really bad. I decided to update windows and after that itâs perfect. No heating and no noise. I love it!!!
Computer does all it claimed but I would recommend getting a pro to set it up initially. I used my face (photo) as the password and it locked up and I had to have my IT specialist reload the entire set of programs due to the nature of the security pack. Key boad small but I use a mouse. The computer is a little heavier but its a workhorse
The battery is horrible and its been just 4 months. It barely lasts an hour. I believe the seller may have custom fit a different battery, not the usual Dell Battery. If it is Dell's battery, then it's even worse. DUPED with this product.
Very serious overheat problem,came out of the box and when first used the cpu almost reached 100 degrees.needed to update bios in order to try to solve the problem,but not solved it entirely the computer still overheats during charging.turns out that the problem is common for this model after a short google search.also the battery life is like 6 hours and not 12 as reviewed. I was very disappointed from this computer,not worth the money.
Mine was properly sealed and a new one. and it was dell inspiron 13- 5000 having a touch pad i think it was an upgraded one from dell.since everything was at the right place and nothing wrong. mine had a nice case and the keyboard was backlitting. but as you can see in other reviews as well it has a bit of heating up problem so please be aware of it when you purchase it.Actually im useing it now and it heat ups quite a lot and has a quite big noise.
It might be only bad luck that's why I gave it 3/5... after a couple of days, the computer suddenly crashed! It has an amazing technology features but, at the moment, the unit that I got was defected and I am sending it back!
Good laptop, all works fine. The only issue is Dell's approach. Small notebook 2 in 1 shouldn't be so heavy in 2018. Many minor things doing it less competitive to Asus and Mac than it could be. Weight, look, buttons...
HDMI is unreliable. This may be a Windows pc issue more so than a specific defect to the product. The only reason I purchased this product was for the hdmi port, which ultimately did not communicat with the device I was trying to connect to. I'm sure everything else functions fine, but my needs were pretty specific.
Very happy with this laptop
Had to send product into dell after failing one week after return date due cheap 3rd party components.
I really like how fast this computer is! I dabble in a few computer games. Mostly SC2. I can easily run it on high settings without a dedicated graphics card. I love using the tablet mode at work! The only down side is the battery life. I usually average about 5 hours with regular use.
Great value.
So far it's a paper weight, it says OS may be corrupt. Not happy, you have made my first Amazon purchase probably my last order.
I bought this small laptop for travel, but fell in love with how fast it works. The drive is so fast at boot up. I use it as my primary laptop now. Will most likely try to switch out 256 drive for a 512 in the future for more space.
Lightening speed. Love it. Wish I had got the 15â?but anazing speed.
Very good
I like the computer. The system specifications are accurate and performance is good. I am disappointed with the quality of the workmanship. The case was clearly taken apart and then reassembled improperly. The bottom access panel wasn't inserted back into the case and there is an obvious gap. I considered returning it but realized I could fix it myself. I unscrewed the access panel and reinserted it properly. For the price the system is sold I expected better.
I've had this laptop for a month and aside from one bothersome issue--I'm happy (not ecstatic) with the purchase. First the good stuff--I'm a novelist so the keyboard is extremely important to me. The size of the keys, the distance between them, and the sound, need to be spot-on. I like the keyboard on this Dell in every way (except the touchpad is a bit flaky and launches my cursor into the document). The speed is very good for what I do (90% word processing with some browsing and occasional streamed movie). The color and clarity of the screen is also very good and the speakers are surprisingly good. No problems there. The weight is not what I would call "light" but it is an improvement from my old Dell laptop from 8 years ago. And the battery--very good, again relative to what I do.My problem is with the fan. It turns on after about 30 minutes of word processing--and won't go off. And it is loud compared to some laptops I have used with SSDs that are so quiet for so long you wonder if they are even on. Not this machine. That is a problem for me since the distraction is, well, distracting. I thought with the quadcore and 16GB of RAM is would stay relatively cool and quiet. Nope. It is whizzing now after twenty minutes of use and shows no sign of letting up. If not for the fan, I would gladly give this otherwise fine performer a solid five stars. I was hoping for a quiet machine. This one is a talker!
see summary below
It was everything I expected. It works quickly and efficiently. Definitely happy with this purchase.
have a noise
It can meet my requirement
Laptop arrived on time and it performs well as expected.
So far preforming quite well!!!
battery life is not great maybe four hours if your lucky..
Very nice
Good price, great product
very good
It will not always boot up.
Researched, and this laptop got good reviews. Took a chance to order it online with Amazon, but wife said that she uses Lenovo computers at work, and they are fine.Pros:Came in 2 days with PrimeBoxed in a box. Then had soft styrofoam corner protectors.Works well and is quiet. It's a laptop with Windows 10, Can barely hear the hard drive. Fan is a fan, not loudTouch screen, which I likeCons:2 minutes of watching the flash Lenovo on the screen15 minutes of downloading updates ( I have DSL, which sucks)During setup, the keys pressed did not always type, which s weird. I was typing, but nothing was showing up, so had to touch the screen to retype it. Maybe it's user error, but it was when typing in my logins for emails and passwords. Didn't happen just once, but probably 5 or 6 times.Annoying: well, it's windows 10, and Cortana comes alive and starts talking you through the setup. She didn't get my wifi right, and had to enter that manually. No big deal. Also, I told it United States on setup, but it didn't ask time zone, and for some reason it was in Belgium. Another hassle, but not too bad.Overall, I would buy again, but I have only used it for a couple of hours. Seems faster than my old laptop, and it should. If something else goes wrong, or comes up as a cool thing, I will update this review.
I needed a quick replacement for my recently-dead laptop and decided on the Lenovo Ideadpad 320. This is a good budget laptop for someone who needs a cheap laptop, be it for school or work. It is pretty fast with an 8th generation i5 and 12GB of memory, but I quickly replaced the hard drive with a much fast SSDâup to 40x faster which is a recommended upgrade for whomever is tired of slow loading of windows and applications. Also, the ports are acceptable, with 2x USB type A and 1 type C, HDMI, card reader, and headphone jack, as well as a DVD drive.Now onto the less positive aspects. The battery life is mediocre, achieving a maximum of 5 hours with regular cases of 2:30 to 3 hours. That is one star deduction for me. The second deduction is from the screen. In 2018, all laptops should have a 1080p display; however, this laptop contains a 720p display, making everything appear huge. The tiny resolution packed into a large display is unacceptable, but it is what it is. The final star comes away from the keyboard, which is abhorrent. Cheap plastic and poor layout design combine to make a miserable typing experience.Ultimately, the Ideapad 320 is good for whomever wants the best laptop for his or her money, as long as they are willing to make many compromises. Just remember you get only what you pay forânothing more and nothing less.
Nice laptop with minimal bloatware out of the box. High speed, good power for multitasking - doesn't skip a beat with multiple applications running. Lenovo has been a solid choice for my last three laptops, and this one seems to be up to the same quality standards as its predecessors after a month of use. This is worlds above HP and Toshiba, which I fought with forever before finding Lenovo. All in all, great laptop at a decent price.
The computer has worked splendidly. Like other reviewers, I was a little surprised how long it took to get the operating system downloaded, but it has worked flawlessly since purchase. I even bought a second Lenovo for my husband.
I think this is a great laptop for what you pay. It isn't fair to try to compare this to a Mac because it clearly isn't one. It is super fast, lightweight and portable, and features a great touchscreen. I don't notice the battery life being poor, but to be honest unless you are lugging it all around, you usually have access to an outlet. I am using mine mainly to write papers for my master's program and the keyboard is very responsive. Is the resolution good? Well, Netflix looks great to me...I'm not a techie, it works great for what I need it for.
Just what I wanted. No troubles at all.
I'm a bit frustrated because this laptop runs soooooo slow. I suspect since it came loaded with Windows 10, and there's all this crap loaded that you don't want is why it's as slow as a turtle. I don't know how to go in and get rid of the useless stuff. I will probably have to take it to the Microsoft store and have them look at it. I do like the design and look of the laptop itself and it's pretty light weight.
Real good buy, it is fast and so far no issues, I also purchased a cannon printer which works very well
I really liked but touch pad broke on its one the when I call there if I go get it fix they may or may not reimbursement do I sent it back
Plastic chassis really brings down the that premium feel.as well as the keys could have a more premium look
I purchased 2 of these laptops less than 60 days ago and the battery life is absolutely horrible! On a full charge it runs down in about 20 minutes. Do not purchase this computer you will not be able to travel with it and you will be disappointed!
More than I expected.. So classy and sleek...loveee eeet
Itâs a great laptop. I am very happy with it.
Less than 2 months old, my new LenovoIdeaPad320 laptop has vital failures.Tech support had me ship it to the service center on my cost. The HDD was running at a 100% usage while no foreground applications were running.I got it back 10 days later with the same problems after new HDD and a fresh installation of windows.Now I have to ship it back again for another 10 days.I need my computer. I canât just be without it. I even told the customer service rep that I will be giving them a bad review on social media With NO appeasements from them whatsoever. Itâs like they donât even care, all she said was âOKâ? what???What kind of technicians donât check their work to see if the problem is fixed??? Really not impressed.Â A little background about myself.I have a college degree in software engineering. I know the ins and outs of computers. So when tech support advised me that the HDD is running at 100% because the Windows system is not updated on freshly installed OS, they canât be anymore-wrong. NOT on fresh installation of windows that is absolutely the idiotic.I have installed enough OSs in my life. The only reason Iâm not doing it myself is because I donât want to void the warranty.
The battery life is terrible^10. The computer is already slowing down. I would not recommend.
For the price and quality of the brand name (Lenovo) at my time of purchase. I am pleased, for the great delivery and how for a month now that everything has been working for my needs.
Bought this machine for my son. He likes it. No problems so far. I'm not computer savey, so I don't know all the ins and outs about the speed, etc., but he has not complained about any problems
Computer power supply failed after 30 minutes. Did not even complete the windows software update.
I bought it for a present and she is delighted.
I bought this as a gift. The receiver really liked it.
My last lenovo lasted seven years so I have high hopes for this one.
Good for the price.
Cheap materials
Just as it's decribed! Speedy delivery. Received it as guaranteed.
This laptop was a massive disappointment. Iâve had a MacBook for the past 10 years and this was like trying to use a flip phone again. The trackpad is useless, it lags, the screen is subpar, and it managed to find and download a virus within the first 30 mins of me using it. Thank you windows. On top of all that it apparently belonged to a Miss Mcloed before me because it had a bunch of stuff saved on there and after I closed it for the first time it kicked me out because I donât actually have Miss Mcloeds password. Youâd think if these people were going to send me a used computer they would atleast give me the password to it. Oh well I had to send it back. And I am relieved to say the least to get my money back.
Love it! I wanted a Laptop that had the core i5 8250U. This processor will beat some the older gen i7 processors or pace with them. You can throw a lot @ this computer. 12 GB of ram well needed with win 10.
Advertised as a "Business Flagship" but comes with Windows 10 Home edition. This is not a business computer.
This thing was extremely slow and noisy. I got another model Lenovo that works much better and am returning this one.
I am very disappointed in the battery life. It runs down very easy!!
got it on 1-9-18, today, so far so good system is very fast (i installed extra 8gb ddr4) but with 8gb is very fast, I'll use it mainly for VMs and 1 or 2 games, but is very nice setup for someone with $699 that wants a powerful & upgradeable pc to play games or work. I've had 3 acer laptops over the years but the keyboard on this one is great.PS: bought from coldriver20 (thanks guys)PS2: I hate win10 but nothing to do, best to do is dual boot with linux.PS3: other memory i got: Patriot Memory Performance Viper DDR4 8GB SODIMM PC4-19200 (2400MHZ) PV48G240C5S Red
Bought this as a back up for my desk top, to create CAD drawings away from home and the most important thing, to run my Oculus Rift Touch I just bought. The specs are great for what I needed. It booted right up, easy set up, took the programs I needed to use. I believe the red keyboard is too bright but can live with it. The only downfall is Windows 10. Wish we had another choice. Started to do some updates and it took 3 days to get them loaded. Not Acers fault but need more options. Great buy for the money!
So far I have had this laptop for a few days and I have to say that for the price, this is a great buy if you wanna start getting into PC gaming. It looks good, feels good, runs most games that I've thrown at it at great frame rates. PUBG and Fortnite play very smooth. Skyrim plays with no issues, I haven't tried any larger more intensive games but I'm guessing you can get some pretty good frame rates at medium to high-ish settings. I like the specs a lot, but I do plan on upgrading the ram to 16Gb and the 1Tb HDD to a faster SDD. The screen looks really nice, gets fairly bright and good viewing angles. The speakers sound pretty good, a bit better than average. The only downsides I've noticed is battery life and noise. When your playing any games its "CoolBoost" technology kicks in and its quite loud. BUT it does keep this laptop really cool on a desk. It could be a different story when its sitting on a bed. The battery life does really suck since its a gaming computer but it doesn't really bother me. One problem is the strength of the lower screen. When you push inward or outward on the bottom middle of the trim around the screen it flexes really bad. So much so that I fear I could accidentally break it when carrying this thing around the house with it open.Other than that I highly recommend this to someone who cant spend the extra 400 for a gaming laptop. At 750, this is a pretty good deal.Fix the screen flex problem though Acer, haha.
I purchased this laptop for out of town use to play World of Warcraft. But to my surprise it can handle games like Witcher 3 on high detail with absolutely no issue. If you are looking for a budget friendly mid ranged gaming laptop, then Acer has done a wonderful job with this laptop.
I bought this computer last month as a replacement for my Dell, and so far it's been great. It runs my games perfectly, and the speed is incredible. My only complaints involve the fan. When I run most of my games on it (primarily WoW, D3,), the fan gets really loud and the computer gets very hot. I'm a little concerned about it overheating, but after a few minutes it starts to cool down. Otherwise, a great computer for a great price.
super fast and very economical!I 'm not a gamer but were looking for something fast ...I am blessed
This thing is so slow, even with no extraneous programs installed on it. I spent several hours trying to clean it up and using other tricks involving disabling various windows features to try to fix it, and it's still slow. As I'm sitting here typing this on my main computer, it's shooting up to 100% disk usage while I'm not running anything except task manager.It looks really cool; the graphics card is pretty nice, but we can't play anything because it has heavy stutter and programs take too long to load.Also, the laptop box wasn't sealed, so that has me concerned that someone had already returned this before.I wanted to like this, but I am profoundly disappointed by it.
This laptop works great, the only issue I have is the the screen is pretty flexible other than that it works great. Also a heads up on future buyers it will not read the Nvidia out of the box you must configure it to load off of it or it will use the intigrated Intel graphics (and we all know what that's like) but once it's configured it can run just pretty much anything fluctuating between 45-60fps but because it is a 1050 I recommend getting a laptop docking fan because it will get hot over long term use. Otherwise great product Acer
Being new into computer gaming reviews are accurate. Runs smooth, and haven't had any issues with games. Battery life sucks, and the fan gets loud, but with my setup it doesn't hinder anything and if I needed something mobile i'll pick up my Switch. Very good buy for the price!
Lags a LOT. Like.. a lot. Online gaming, loading webpages, even just booting up takes FOREVER and sometimes the screen glitches out and causes odd black squares to appear. Mind you, this is a NEW machine. Trackpad is VERY VERY bad, you'd need an external mouse. If not plugged into the charger, keyboard lights go off way too often. and if played on a lap, the speakers are muted because they're in an odd place. Not worth the price!
I dont have alot of experiences with laptop, but my 10 year old laptop is better than this one. I only had this laptop for somewhere around 4 months and it crashed. The only thing i use this laptop for is just games, thats it. I dont even play any heavy or expensive games on this laptop. If i cann give negativve stars on amazon i would.
I've had this for a while now. Still runs fast. It can run all of the games i want like Overwatch and rocket league. My VR headset works really well with it too.
Great for the Oculus, runs pretty well. Once and a while it does freeze up for a moment, but itâs hardly noticeable and itâs stopping after a while.
Bought this for gaming. As soon was able to download games quickly hasnât given me any issues.
Great laptop. Have had no issues with it.
I bought a referbed one from another site and have been using for over a month now... holy cow it is awesome. Best laptop Iâve ever used hands down. Plays Wow, Fortnite no problems at all. Liked it enough I bought this brand new one for full price for my wife. She hasnât had a chance to use it but I can assume itâs obviosuly just as good. 100% recommend
Bought this for my Son, I am not computer savvy, buy according to my son, this is the best!
Came to me with the seal broken very dissatisfied.
Win10 starts fast from the 256GB SSD and the display, although less resolution than my iPad and my desktop, is good enough for my applications. I use all three USB ports: USB3s for two HDDs and USB2 for wireless mouse receiver. All the ports work except for the headphone port. It only works if I firmly press and hold the jack in the port. As a remedy, I'll look into buying a Bluetooth headphone. I am using the DVD drive to install some of my programs and it is working well. Overall. I'm pleased with the laptop hdwe and sfwe at the price ($549) and with Prime delivery.June 10, 2018 Update: I added 8GB memory (total now 16GB) and a 2.5" 7mm 5400rpm 1TB HDD (installed in a 9.5mm high caddy which replaces the DVDRW drive). HP Maintenance Guide and HP Laptop YouTube videos provided the necessary DIY instructions.
I bought this because I was starting a business. It booted up right away and I didn't have any problems going through the Microsoft Windows setup process with Cortana. A little annoying that Cortana wants to yap at you and I'd rather just go through the process quietly. Once started, I found it to be fast.My biggest concerns for this were the 256 GB SSD and the only 8 GB of RAM. So far I've seen no problem with the RAM. And the SSD operates with good speed as the system boots up from a dead shutdown in probably 20s or less. It wakes from a state of shutdown to the Windows security screen in about 10 seconds,which is faster than a Dell laptop I use for my day job.Overall I'm pretty happy with this. One issue: it had Office installed on it, and I was pleased with that, but then it expired avfter 30 days and I realized I still had to buy it. I couldn't get around the necessity to create an account with Microsoft, which is very annoying. I don't want an account with Microsoft and I have no desire to be owned by them any more than I have to. It was irritating to have to buy a downloadable $130 license to Microsoft Office after I already spent nearly $600 on this. I wish they were more transparent about it.Lastly, HP has a pesky background "assistant" that they install on all their computers. I also have an older home "all in one" PC that is an HP product and the assistant software really bogs it down. I uninstalled all of the unnecessary HP nanny-ware and the computer seems no worse for the wear as a result.
Great computer. Super lightweight. lots of power.
Very unhappy with this computer. I thought that by buying a Windows10 Pro, that I would be all set! Wrong! You have to pay for and add programs like a DVD player and others.
Fast and easy to navigate
Had to return this. I love Dell computers so I was very sad when I had to return this product. When it arrived I was a little disappointed in how inexpensive it felt. The texture feels very plasticy. I had problems right from the beginning. The sound worked sometimes, but not other times. The computer would freeze when loading websites and it would freeze when I would type on Word - not something that takes a lot of memory, so I have no idea why it was so glitchy. I contacted Dell and there was a very nice tech who helped me. I let him take control of the computer and he ran all of the diagnostics and couldn't get it working correctly either. He said he was going to do an exchange for me. I told him it was important that I have a working computer quickly for a project I was working on. He said he understood. For two weeks I checked the status of my request and it said open. Then one day I checked it and it said "closed" and when I checked the computer part of it it said computer "unavailable". I checked with Amazon and they allowed me to return the computer right away, thankfully. I went to restore the system back to factory settings before sending the computer back to Amazon and it asked me if I wanted to restore back to Windows 7. Then I was really frustrated because I purposely bought a Windows 10 O.S. This meant that they sent me a computer with a Windows 10 O.S. built on top of a Windows 7 O.S. I could have purchased a nicer computer for a lot less with a Windows 7 O.S. and installed the Windows 10 platform on top myself if that is what I had wanted!!!Anyway, this was just a big disappointed for me all the way around.
Windows 10 updates out of the Box. Took 90 minutes for all the updates to install. The speakers and HDMI output looks great and it does the job. Plays 1080 MPEG videos to a large screen for demos. Its also super light, feels like a solid college rulled notebook.Absolutely have to upgrade the RAM to 8 GM Minimum because the memory is shared between to OS and the Intel 620 Graphics. Get is now its very inexpensive and easy to upgrade.Pro Tip it shares the same 45W power supply as larger HP 17.3" laptops. So switching it from desknti desk is easy is an open office plan.
8/31/2017 . . . I had to reset this HP to to factory settings today. Since this laptop was delivered July 19, 2017, I have encountered more and more slow responses, freezes, and blue screens of death. For Windows 10, it's a much lighter shade of blue than it used to be. Very frustrating. Wasted lots of time dealing with what the HP analysis tools reported as Windows 10 failures and problems with the partitions it created. Equipment checked out according to the HP analysis program, but it has been behaving suspiciously like the hard drive failure on the Dell this one replaced, I' beginning to discover there are no reliable hard drives or virtual drives. They WILL fail. HP seems to have problems accommodating Windows 10, as do ALL anti-virus programs. Nothing good for my computers on which I installed Windows 10.ORIGINAL REVIEW:My observations after 3 days:RUNS COOL! No overheating problems so far.Nice screen resolution with responsive touch screen.Camera seemed grainy, could have been lighting.Keyboard is OK (After all, it is a laptop)Touch pad is weird. Will require retraining your finger/thumb muscles. Although it does have left click and right click buttons, they are UNDERNEATH the touch pad, so at first, you'll occasionally click on the wrong thing. The cursor will move if you don't hit the buttons dead on. Not that bad, just different. I got used to it fairly quickly.Updates didn't take long . . . maybe an hour or two.6 GB RAM is adequate, but seemed odd to me. Why not build evenly? Max 16GB. Holds 2 X 8 GB memory sticks.DDR4 Memory. Description lists DDR4, but additional Information shows DDR3. It really is DDR4..The 2.4 GHz CPU speed is good, especially for a computer under $500.00; it is NOT slow.Haven't put much stress on the processor yet, so can't tell how it will perform in the long run.Used laptop without the charger for about 6 hours (mostly online w/ minimal disk use) before warning appeared that only 20% battery life remained.It runs Windows 10, and to create a recovery drive you must use a USB flash drive. It took up 8.6 GB on a 32 GB USB 2.0 drive. Probably need at least 16 GB drive to be safe. I used USB 2.0 rather than 3.0. It was cheap and took minutes, not hours. (May encounter errors first few attempts, but keep trying. Third time was a charm for me.) I still miss Windows 7 and computers that came with manuals & system CDs.The hard drive storage capacity of 1 TB is probably more than you can use before it eventually fails. The life of a USB drive is not that predictable either, but if only used for the recovery drive and written to only occasionally, it should outlast the hard drive by years.If computer develops problems, I'll revise this review.So far, I have been pleased with this purchase.
I absolutely love this laptop! It is so much faster than the Toshiba I was using. It was really simple to set up as well. Works well with my existing printer. By the way, it is a touch screen which I love as well.
this computer had everything we wanted & needed. I have had NO problems with this computer since day one!
VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.
Do not buy this laptop. I have had it for a month and a half and it does not work. Now I am out of the return period so I'm just out the money. Runs very very slow. I guess you get what you pay for and I should have spent more money.
blue screen several times.I use the laptop a little, and three times I've used it, I've gone blue screen twice.
This last 2 months biggest piece of crap!!! It sat on my desk most of the time and I needed it for a weekend trip so I unplugged it and took it with me. After unplugging it 4 or 5 times the inside adapter for the battery charging broke. When I contacted Dell they said it wasn't covered in warranty it was wear and tear.... and I would have to pay to replace it. What?!? It was two months old it should have lasted a lot longer then that. Never again I am going back to Gateway or HP both have better warranties on their products.
This was the worst Dell laptop I ever bought. Within 3 months, I had the keyboard stop working. I had their tech people work on it for hours and it hasn't been right ever since. They claim it's the software which is not their problem. I think the girl took off things that weren't supposed to be removed. I have hardly used it. It blacks out after an hour or so. I have to take it to a repair shop soon. Wasted my money here.I have always had Dell and never had trouble with them. got to be this model
This computer is so slow I have given up on using it. It can't even keep up with the speed of my typing. Also, the pop-up endorsements for other products like McAfee are so frequent... They showed up every 10 minutes or so. Could not run the older version of Office that I own only because Dell updates would reset my defaults over and over to the newer version I would have to subscribe to. Sadly, Dell products have become a marketing vehicle for other products. I gave this laptop away and have gone back to my 10-year-old Dell which is much faster. How could they go so far downhill?
This is my first laptop in 10 years. The last one ran on Windows Vista. I won't attribute my inadequacies to the troubles I was having, but it was a bit hard to transition. Not helped by the constant updating and the fact that after you turn it on from sleep mode, nothing works. Nothing works for almost 5 minutes, then does without any indication or explanation. The touchscreen is fine, unnecessary for me. The box on the charger gets crazy hot. The battery life percentages are way off. And the touch pad doesn't work right, but as a promotion it come with a wireless mouse. All these little things made for a big headache, but I stuck with it.
Disappointed in the product. It didn't live up to its expectations. Since having other dell products, I thought it was a name I can trust, since I've had great success with them, until this purchase. And their technical support is not helpful at all. Haven't even had this for a year, and it is already defective. Still under warranty for a couple more months, and they will take care of this, or I will be contacting the BBB and other agencies. This was purchased because I have a limited budget, otherwise I would have gotten a MAC.
This laptop has turned out to be better than I imagined! I'm usually a Mac person, but since buying this Dell touchscreen (which I love), I don't see myself switching back anytime soon! It runs smoothly, and quietly and has an amazing display! I wish it had a keyboard light, but other than that, it's been wonderful so far!
This laptop stopped working in the first month of use. Either the seller provided us a bad product or the laptop itself is of poor quality. Regardless, the seller is not willing to take the laptop back because we do not have the original box the laptop came in. My purchase was a total loss.
Wife loves this laptop. Allows her to watch movies on-line, surf the web, shop and do all the modern things one does on a laptop. Much faster than her 2 year old Dell it replaced. Wouldn't want to play any high graphic games on it but for everyday use, email, word etc it is great.
Only had a very short time and half the screen went black... not happy
I bought this laptop as a birthday gift for my mother July 2017 of this year and here in December 2017 the hard drive goes bad in it. And my mother is not an extensive user. She uses it mostly to check her email. I never would have figure. I wonder if this was a refurbished item sold for brand new.
Pretty good for the price.Bought it to edit videos mainly. Works well with video editor software. (video pad). (lightworks, however, did not want to run. could just be me, though, as that editor is complicated compared to Movie Maker etc).Can game moderately, but don't expect HQ graphics. Most of my games --Skyrim, Divinity Original Sin 2, Saints Row 3-- all have to run on the lowest graphics setting.Touch screen is a nice feature. Webcam is alright, too.
Arrived on time beautiful laptop all set to go online love it no problems
To my greatest surprise the first day after receiving this laptop keys from the keyboard started popping off. Additionally, the wires in the charger is broken after 6 weeks and i do not mishandle my laptop. I am a very dissatisfied customer because i have this laptop for less than 3 month and already it is showing signs of not last a long time. I had acer laptops before and i never encountered this, i regret my purchase.
I read reviews saying this computer was very slow. It is not. Maybe at the beginning, when you first start it, it may take a bit longer to run, but soon it is smooth riding. Very good computer.
Product is great until it fails the ne week after amazon return timed out. Then you go to Dellâs service and get to rebuild software multiple time and reboot even more often. The service is from a foreign land which will run you around until you give up!Bad Dell,bad Dell
Really slow laptop it keep shutting down I hate it quality is so cheap I'm so disappointed
Great product! It was slow at first but once you clean out the laptop from all the bloatware it becomes really fast. It has great specs on it and I'm using the laptop right now to write this review.Definitely recommend to any student going to school!
I really love this laptop it works great no problems runs well glad I got this thank you very much
Shipped on time and good buy
Bought this laptop and immediately after updating the machine it developed the 'Blue Screen of Death' problem. Contacted Microsoft support and they advised me to contact the manufacturer and return the laptop. This machine kept on having frozen screen moments and it was hell of slow before it developed the BSOD stop code error. Sucks big time. Very dissappointed.
I am using this computer and loving it. This computer works faster and better then my old one.
love this laptop am writing review on it what I needed
I absolutely love my new Dell. It is my preferred brand of computer. My son accidentally spelled his drink on my last one, so he gave me a new Toshiba. It never did meet the expectations of my Dell, so I purchased this one. I have had a few problems, but it is usually operator error. I really love it. Thank you!
Couldn't handle the windows 10 update. Got the blue screen of death every 20 minutes.... Had to return it. Nice laptop, but useless if it doesn't work properly. Super frustrating experience...
This item is very slow and it's touch screen does not perform well. As a new computer , I thought it's operating system would perform with less delay.
Awful computer, crashes constantly doing simple tasks like browsing or watching Netflix. I've had it 2 weeks and I'm looking for options to return it.
Slow as hell and defective. Buy an I5 with ssd for $200 more. It is worth the money.
Dell never disappoints.
Great computer!!
Five Stars
Bad product. Had it 2 months, then suddenly failed to charge. Now unusable. Evidently no return accepted.
Works well but the volume is to low
I bought this laptop for University. I loved it for the first week. However after the first month it stopped charging. I bought new charger from Dell and that doesn't charge it either. I'm lost at what to do now.
Brother loves this for his college laptop
I bought this in September. The power cord has never worked properly. It doesnât charge so the laptop has to be plugged in the whole time.
To many apps, some very hard to understand. Would like to see less stuff. Very fast but some of the apps take control and slow it down a lot.
It came with a faulty motherboard. Had to send it to dell to fix.
There is a problem with the keyboard. Whenever I press the buttons to get '@' , I get " and when I try to get " I get '@'
I am sending it back after less than a day of owning it. This is the slowest machine I have ever worked with. I guess you get what you paid for. It is fine for home use. I don't like windows 10 :(
Overall happy with this laptop. Very slow for a new computer, will be upgraded Ram.
Major problem. Kept shutting off. Message said Microsoft windows didn't load properly and to get help from a qualified technician. Turned it off for 2 days and when I turned it back on, it worked fine.
Works great for our needs
Not sure if I just got a bad unit, but once I finish d the 6+ hours it took to install all the software and then finally got to the point of entering my wifi code, the moment I got past the online bit to open the Microsoft Edge or Internet explorer whatever's called the sound of an alarm or whistle went off saying "Stop! You have a virus in your software and you need to call this 800 number" well, I hit the roof! I thought I bought a new laptop, not one that had a virus from the moment GO! I'm not sure if this is typical of this product or the software but I've not experienced this before not even with my 4 yr old toshiba, it was returned needless to say. I can only say this, I hope that I was given a used Dell by mistake, this would be the only way I can understand the problem that occurred. This has placed a very bad taste in my mouth towards Dell products.
Not perfect but very solid and can serve multiple purposes
Seems to be working great !! A little heavy !
Great laptop for the price !
Every Dell I have bought has been an excellent computer except this one. This refurbished piece of junk keeps crashing. Apparently I'm stuck with it as Amazon's return window is only sixty days.
It's a DELL that all I need to say
I am very please with my Dell. I am still learning about it.
CD ROM has issues playing some dvds
does not load apps correctly..Face Book disappears at will Bad decision on my part A lot of money for a bad product
Got this for my 15 year old and it is working out perfect
Granddaughter loves
Product stopped working as soon as the replacement and support window closed. Company is not good, product is crap
Super slow processer.
A new computer that super slow. Returning this because itâs driving me nuts. Only had it for less than a week.
Runs Very poorlyOften have to reboot several times before able to useRuns very slowly
Not happy with some of the pre-installed programs. They are difficult to work with without some instructions
Very disappointed sitting thru my 3rd 3-4 hr restart. My tablet and phone work just fine. I think I'm returning it.
Works great first time out of the box.
Can not usethe browser without going off line with a message 'can't connect."
This is an awsome computer
A little complicaded for me at 89yr. but it works!
It is all i expected n more!! GREAT!!!
Very nice laptop. Great deal. Shipped right away.
Great computer just runs a bit slow somtimes
Bought this to replace a Dell i3542-6003BK I bought about 2 years ago that inexplicably died one day. Likely motherboard failure. While the same price, this model is superior in just about every way. Speakers are much louder, screen much brighter, Bluetooth actually works properly, WiFi more reliable, build-quality feels much more robust. Just a really great piece of equipment for the money.
Everything as expected
Poor! Blue screen! So badToo many problems since the purchase. Please do not buy this product. To finish the guarantee is not international!!!-5 stars
We had lots of problems with this laptop, it kept freezing up so we had to take the battery out to re set it. It just never worked well so we ended up sending it back.
This laptop sounded like such an awesome help for my last year in graduate school. It might still be, but I think I got a lemon. This is going back and will be exchanged for a like model. Without even wanting it to, I will be writing or revising a paper and the font will shrink to 25%. This happens over and over again. The charger cable, a Dell Charger cable, does not read properly so I am consistently getting messages saying that it is not charging my battery. Things like this might not be such a problem if I were not having to move at such warp speed like I do. I just do not have the time or patience to mess with issues like that.
Um, the computer performs well.My disadvantages noted:1. The mouse: For gaming purposes think twice. You can't right click and left click at the same time. Opt: Buy a game controller.2. It overheats.3. The power lasts about 3 hours under extreme.The first computer delivered was dead on arrival.The second so far is performing.I advise to take out insurance just in case.Thanks.
Very disappointed. The laptop's hard drive failed already. Just a few days after the return period expired. I contacted the seller but am not sure whether I will get a response. I have never had such a failure with a Dell product.
Daughter used it one month at college and screen glitched only half of screen works other half is black
Super cool
The product itself is great, just wish it came with all the software disks.
Works very well. Easy to setup and I love the keyboard.
good product
wifes says it fine
slower than slow.very disappointed.return.
The touch was not as good as expected
Do not listen to other reviews overrating this laptop because they do not have that much computer knowledge. This laptop came in ahead of time and the system specifications such as the processor, ram, etc. were as stated, but the laptop comes with lots of bloatware. It will take you about 3 hours to do the initial necessary Windows 10 updates and then another 2 or more hours to remove all the additional bloatware (not to mention that Windows 10 also has it's own bloatware). Basically, it is not a clean laptop to begin with and will take TIME to clean up (If you are knowledgeable enough to even clean all of it up without messing up the system.) Furthermore, the version of Windows 10 that is installed in this laptop is Windows 10 Home, which is not as good as Windows 10 Pro. I had to update to Windows 10 Pro by myself. If you know what you are doing, then this laptop has good system specs for it's price, but if you are not, I recommend you stay away.
This is a Christmas gift so hopefully it's going to be great
So far device works fine
My old Asus bit the dust from too many falls (the screen popped off) so I had to get a new laptop. I decided to give Dell a try and since this had a touchscreen, which I've come to love and cherish. I swear on my life the listing said this has a backlit keyboard because that was the other "bell and whistle" I was looking for. When the Dell laptop came, it did NOT have a backlit keyboard, the screen was sucky from poor graphics. Basically, if you want a low model basic laptop, maybe this is for you. If you want something that goes above and beyond, get something else (hint hint very happy with my new Asus Q504UA). I returned this Dell laptop....it was like going back to using rocks and sticks.
I am using around 3 week... speed of window is terrible.... I never recommend this product..Maybe.. this computer was made in secondition world wAR not 2017
Very nice lap top
Don't rely on this computer for anything. It is only about 3 months old and freezes or goes to blue screen almost half the time I use it. I have had it looked at by 2 techs not including the Dell tech team. The Dell tech was very nice and she connected to my computer to try to find the problem or problems. She told me to keep a log to document any more anomalies. Here are the results from 10-25-17 to 11-15-17: 4 blue screens in 2 days, 7 more blue screens after that for a total of 11, and 1 freeze. That's 12 anomalies in 22 days. It was protected by Norton, In short, No more Dells for me. But if your favorite color is blue and you have all the time in the world to waste on a very poor lap top, then go for it .But remember you get what you pay for and with Dell, a lot less. 0 stars would be more accurate. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to shop for a new HP... Mike
I have two days with this laptop and it's super slow, at first I thought it was because the programs were running for the "first" time but it's all set up and keeps slow, I don't have photos, music or any program installed so I can't imagine if I start installing something. My phone is faster than this laptop. I keep getting "no response" using internet explorer and I am just using two tabs with nothing else open. Super slow, no keyboard light. I will return this tomorrow morning.
okay, should probably spend more if you're looking for more than very mediocre. Looks clunky, feels clunky, no lit up keyboard (though that wasn't promised) the headphone jack is very sensitive and often takes several tries to connect which is frustrating, has started updating with no warning. Does work fine for basic things and has an okay picture. Serves basic needs but doesnt excel at anything. Does not have a good warranty offered by dell or amazon. If you only need the internet and a few apps and don't mind these things should be okay. The screenshot tool is also pretty annoying.
Couldn't be happier with this product. I wasn't expecting much for the price but I was totally wrong. The touchscreen is a awesome when playing certain games, it's got enough storage to upload all of my old laptops onto one hard drive too. I've been using is about a month, I've had no errors, no lag, no problems! I paid almost 3 times this for my last laptop and it barely lasted two years. I see this one lasting a long time!
After reading mixed reviews, I decided to wait a few months before posting a review. I use this laptop almost every single day. It has been great. There haven't been any problems. I have always had Dell PCs. Rarely have I had any problems with them. Dell is usually pretty good at helping customers resolve any PC issues.The bottom line is that I am very happy with this laptop.
I've had mine for just over a year now. I hate it. It's so slow. I just use it for social sites and occasionally for work. The mouse is dreadful. It's so noisy and you have to try so many times to get it to right click. Also the charging port broke out and is loose in the computer, so now I can't charge it. I have to get it repaired. I would not recommend this...
for some reason the computer screen flickers when I turn it on??? after about 10 seconds it stops. computer itself functions great. i'm not sure why this is happening?? it's kinda annoying
Good price.
I got this on last March, today I tried to log in and found my key board dose not work. I called their customer service and was told my laptop warranty just expirated, I have to pay 150 to replace the key board. So you just get what you paid for. If you don't want spend 100 per year for warranty, DO NOT expect the quality. Just one year, throw it out! Also, they have worst customer services, you want to abuse yourself, you ahead to buy one!
I like my notebook, but occationally something comes up missing even though I had saved it. I like it, its light and easy to use.
first notebook I've owned . love the touch screen . big hard drive. Don't know much about computers but it fullfills my needs. Price was good . Arived promptly.
Significant connectivity issues. SLOW restart. But an overall decent product ... the 62% Of the time it works.
I really like the touch screen and have yet to find something I didn't like.
Love this computer. It's light weight and very fast. Simple, yet practical.
Great Laptop for it's price, fast and effective, really silent and sleek.
Muy buen producto!!
So far, so good!!
Great I'm glad I purchased it.
Amazing computer!
Superfast and beautiful! Works great so far!
i hate this computer with a passion ! its the slowest thing ever and there isn't even anything on it, just from the factory slow!! i have an HP printer too and i can't even get the computer to see that printer is online unless i physically turn the wi-fi off and then on again and that defeats the purpose of a wireless printer, don't you think??? We have a Dell that we were hoping to replace with the HP, the Dell doesn't have any issues talking to the printer and printing!AND i have to have a password to even uses the darn thing, WHY??? i should have to choice of adding a password or not!
This is a very nice laptop. I am really happy with my purchase.
It meets my expectations
It was nce
Terific product, easy to use. Nothing to dislike!!!!
Out of the box screen was black. I had to plug it in to an external monitor just to use it.
I'm not sure that it would be a good buy at $999.00 but if you watch out for specials it is a great deal. I got mine for $799.00 and at that price I think it is excellent. I bought the 128GB/4GB Ram version and it works great. One of the tasks I wanted this for was for photography editing on affinity photo. I was worried that the 4gb of ram would not be enough. I figured that if it wasn't enough i could always return it. but fortunately the laptop is holding its own. However I wouldn't recommend for video editing. Other features I really like on this are the Windows Hello feature. It works insanely well. Also, the track pad is amazing! The best I've ever seen on a PC. I didn't give windows 10 S a chance so I can't review that. The first thing I did was upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. This upgrade is available until 3/30/18 so don't wait too long if you're interested in this. After that date I read it will be a $50 upgrade.
I am an intense user and the Surface Laptop is the best laptop I owned so far. Upgraded it to Win 10 Pro since I need a wide variety of software on the machine for professional use (Image processing, CAD, etc.). The upgrade was free and easy. The keyboard is very precise and comfortable, allowing for fast typing. Mouse and touch screen very accurate. The display is crisp with natural colors. Processor and SSD performance is ample. Beautiful detail solutions like the power supply plug and the additional USB charging port in the power supply add to the appeal. And the design is clean, minimalist, beautiful.I hope I will have this laptop for a very long time!
I work in IT so I get to see/touch and go through a lot of Windows PC's, Chromebooks and tablets.This is, by far, the best computer of any sort, Mac or otherwise, that I have ever touched, seen, owned or used. It's just perfect in every way.The hardware design is beautiful. It has a solidness to it that feels Apple or Mercedes quality. The screen is beautiful, touch, and it's fast.Battery life is great, performance is great, the keyboard has a perfect travel distance and click for those of us that are rapid typists-- you won't be disappointed.It has "real" usb connectivity which is so uncommon these days. The touchpad is glass and sensitive enough that I will use it. Previously Mac was the only computer with a good enough touchpad that I was willing/able to give up a wireless mouse.I could not be more pleased with this computer, I love it to the end of the world and back. I never thought I'd be considered a fanboy of any product, but here I am.
Not my first time buying a surface product and wont be the last. Perfect for a person who primarily needs email, internet, music and media organization. I also do light picture editing from raw format and this handles that very well.
This is a great Windows laptop. I wish it had come with a little documentation (especially for how to take advantage of the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro), but Microsoft support was able to take care of that for me. It feels and performs great. I had ordered a Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 with an i7 processor, and that got too hot to comfortably use in my lap on the sofa. The Surface laptop is perfect for me.
Very nice piece of hardware. I few minor complaints: Not nuts about how the charge cable interfaces with the laptop.. not as good as the maglock system but macs use but better than the typical connector. It is short on ports. Display Port, USB3 and a headphone jack... and thats it. I wish for a built card reader when I forget to bring my USB card reader.Aside from those complaints, its great. Great keyboard, great track pad and HOLYSHITAWESOME SCREEN. Looks great and 3:2 aspect ratio is so great for actual productivity.Great battery life and highly portable size and weight.Tight integration between OS and hardware shows.. everthing just works.
Amazing product, the materials are great. Feels that it is a premium quality.The battery may disappoint you because in tech specs you can see that it will work 14.5 hours. As for me I couldn't get from it more than 8 hours.It may heat if you will play games, then you need some additional cooling.Also the screen ratio is 2x3 that is great for work. But for movies it may be not as wide as you would like.Touch screen is great, very responsible. To keyboard and touch pad there is no complaints.
Excellent build quality. I have absolutely no reservations about the Surface Laptop. I think its better than the Surface Book I own. Microsoft got it right on this one.Positives: Fabric on top of the keyboard, quiet, all metal build, small and thin, fast.Note: I would suggest upgrading it to Windows 10 Pro from Windows 10 S. Its currently free to this at this time.
I bought this for my wife to replace her older, bulky, HP laptop. It was a few years old and replacement was due. She picked this one out at a retail store and we found it on Amazon for a reduced price. She LOVES it!! So light, fast, and cute because it's her favorite color. The palm rests have a cloth feeling but they are made of some plastic stuff that's easily cleaned, the screen looks great, and the keyboard feels right... partly due to the palm rests allowing a person to rest palms on them while typing. It has a fast hard drive, it's quiet and light. I really don't have negatives to say about it except that it only has a couple of USB 3 ports. That's OK... I bought a tiny USB 3 hub and we're all good now. Definitely recommend this device though it's not cheap.
I have a very big an powerful desk computer required for my research. But for a personal on-the-road computer mostly for light duty stuff this $999 machine is perfect for me. I hope Microsoft does not destroy it with add-on's, unfortunately their past record suggests otherwise.
I've wanted a Surface computer for awhile and I'm so glad I bought it. I shopped around before deciding on Amazon. The free 2 day shipping sealed the deal for me. BB had it for around the same price but with shipping this came out less. This laptop has a very fast boot time, and the fact that Cortana really simplified the setup was very cool.
The wifi reception is crap and slower than by 5 year old laptop. Everything has been tried, including changing the router but nothing work. The download speed varies from single digits to about half the model/server rate. Microsoft support has been no help.
I've had this laptop for about three months, and this is the second laptop (after the Rose Gold MacBook), that I have looked forward to using day in and day out. It is a weird feeling, being in love with your laptop. Most of us have probably own at least 6 laptops in our lifetimes, so you can understand where I'm coming from when I say most of us use our laptops in a utilitarian sort of way: We use it because we need to, and when we don't, we just put it away without any thought. If you want a big screen, or to play games, you would use your desktop. When you want something portable, you would most likely use your tablet. When you want something on the go, we have all used our smartphone as our main day-to-day gadget. So that leaves our laptop, as more of a business machine for doing something that requires typing on the go, whether it be to reply to an important email you can't just use your phone for, or to type out something on Word or Google Docs. For many of us, browsing the Net just isn't as satisfying on our small phones, even if it is some 6.2" monster. There is something tactile, yet intangibly indescribable, about using our laptopYet, this is the first Windows laptop that makes me look forward to using it each day. The main culprit: Oh that gorgeous piece of metal and color. To be honest, if it just came in silver like its Surface Book counterpart, I would have never given it a second thought (by the way, I have that too, but its novelty has since worn off). I got the Burgundy version, which is just so unique - where else can you get a wine red laptop?? Each time I open its laptop sleeve and pull it out, I have to pause a moment to admire its chiseled look first, before propping it open and using it. Not only does it look great, it feels great too. As you run your fingers through it, you will appreciate that you have one of the most luxurious laptops ever. No that is not a hyperbole.Another thing that make it stands out: The stereo speakers underneath the keyboard is the best I have ever heard in a laptop (I am overseas right now, and my Huawei Matebook X awaits at home with its Dolby Atmos Harmon Kardon speakers, so I'll do an update soon). It is loud and immersive - it can't get too loud where it would create aural distortions, so at its peak it is just awesomely loud and clear enough. I have a keyboard protector over it, but I always take it off when I have some audio playing - yes, the sound is that good.Touchscreen laptops might be a gimmick, but having it is never a negative. It is perfect for scrolling web sites. Once you use it that way, you'll never go back to scrolling with your mouse or trackpad again.Speaking of the trackpad, it's supposed to have the Windows Precision software aspect, but it still is goofy most of the time. Scrolling, switching, zooming, etc., still isn't as good as any MacBooks.And speaking of the keyboard and keyboard cover, key travel and sponginess are excellent. However, the keys are a bit more slippery than I would like, so I definitely recommend one of those gel keyboard covers to help you type more precisely.The screen is bright and excellent - one of the best screens I have used. The resolution isn't as crisp and nice as my Surface Book and Macbook, but definitely better than most.About that whole Alcantara-layered interior - yes it is beautiful, yes it feels great (no more cold palms in the winter). Just keep it clean (no eating potato chips while using it).Finally, the i5 and 8GB of RAM are good enough to avoid any hiccups in performance of your every usage of a normal laptop. This is not for gaming or video rendering, so if you are not expecting that, then this laptop's performance will not disappoint.The bottom line is you will buy this laptop for its looks, period. There is no value for this laptop - it is targeted as a premium-level laptop, not a value-level laptop. Any other normal laptop with these specs would be about $200 less. So you just have to ask yourself if the burgundy or slate blue color, and the style of design/craftsmanship are worth it for you.
Sexy, hot, fast, thin, solid, beautiful, functional and ready to go whenever and wherever. Not used to the heat though but keep the computer on a solid source..desk etc help to keep it Kool :)
Love it so far. I've only had it for about two weeks - but it works well. I'm pleased with the laptop - boots FAST - pretty easy setup. Light weight is nice and I purchased a docking station and hooked it up to my specialty keyboard and mouse. Added a 34" monitor and all works great so far!
On time, as promised, in a sealed manufacturer's box. Well done. The laptop is nice, although you need to do the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro in order to be able to run normal (non-app store) apps.
Allows me to wander about the house and keep up with email, investments, and searches. Very lightweight, no noisy fan, runs cool, looks cool, and has a great display.
It's a truly awesome laptop both in design and in performance. I love using it. Highly recommend this over its closest rival XPS 13. If only the screen could flip over so that Surface Pen could be used to full potential, the usability would have magnified. Nonetheless, I recommend it to everyone who want quality and performance.
After installing all of the updates and semi-configuring the laptop. I have an issue. The touchpad is terrible. It decides when it wants to allow you to right click or click anything. I don't always want to touch my screen to start an action. This is the WORST touchpad I've ever used on a laptop and I work in IT. My Huawei Matebook X touchpad responds when I decide to use it which is every time I'm using the computer. Changing the sensitivity doesn't help. I should never have to click on the touchpad more than once to bring up the right dialog menu or to launch a program. This is a disaster. I'm returning it.
Amazing feel and fast to operate. Definitely worth getting the i7 extra RAM. Only drawback would be the lack of ports. One usb and one display. Likely need a surface dock to be completely satisfied with this laptop. Other than that, amazing.
The worst laptop I have ever purchased: while functionally it is light and holds a charge, the Windows10S operating system is awful. From the get-go, simple things like attempting to download antivirus software (Norton) get repeatedly blocked by Windows Defender. If you decide you want to get Chrome, try again because it will redirect you to the Microsoft App store. Historically I have enjoyed using Windows, but this new PC and OS have all the overzealous proprietary turnoffs that I avoided Apple for. Do not buy this product.
Just started using it. I like it. Good ergonomics, well-laid out. Very happy.
This is the best laptop ive ever owned and im very picky. I highly recommend this laptop!
Handles all my needs, fast lightweight and plenty of battery power. Had the first version Andre turned it. They have done a great job
Exceeded my expectations! Not too big and not too small. It is perfect. I found a great case for it on amazon. Highly satisfied customer.
Amazing product - fast, light, great battery life. What's not to like?
Got this for my lady for Christmas. She loves it: easier to use than a laptop, and easier to carry around. It's fast, lightweight, and helps her organize her busy schedule.
Ideal netbook. Lightweight, fast and very portable.
Great laptop. Beautiful to look at. Light. As a business user, the keyboard travel is fantastic and the Alacantra skin makes it very comfortable to use. It's May 2018 and you can still upgrade free to Windows 10 Pro (thank heavens!). Very glad I did not buy another laptop.
Really enjoy this laptopâs blend of features: itâs beautifully designed without being fragile, the touchscreen is a useful option, and itâs quite thin and lightweight. Immediately used the free upgrade to Windows pro 10. No complaints!
I got this for Christmas and couldn't wait to set everything up! I did my research before buying this laptop so I knew what to expect. The set up was quick as usual and I got all my programs installed. Great laptop!
I really love this laptop so far. I have bad luck w/ technology so figures cross. But so far. No problem. I did upgrade to the Windows 10 instead of leaving it for 10s, which gave me more options to utilize. I recommend doing that! This laptop is smooth and fast!
Incredible disappointed. After 5 phone calls to Microsoft Support the keyboard still didnt work. One day wasted on a computer is ridiculous. The only reason for paying for the Microsoft bran is to avoid bad quality, like this.
I made a mistake when I ordered this. I meant to order the Surface Pro with detachable keyboard cover, and instead ordered the laptop. I have little experience with laptops, but this one seems satisfactory in all respects.
light and fast. looks great. screen is vivid and bright. battery is long. price is reasonable. very good buy
Great thin surface laptop. Great for its price. Say bye to macbooks.
Between the fabric lightness, speed, convenience. I love it all!!!!
This laptop is awesome! I am amazed at the ease of use, lightweight and speed! I am super happy with my choice.
Sleek machine, the fastest-booting computer I ever owned and good looking too. Downside is that there's just one usb slot and none for sd cards.
UPDATE: May 30, 2018: Do Not Buy This Laptop! The screen on mine broke for no apparent reason that I can think of. I did not drop the laptop, sit on the laptop, bend the laptop, hit the laptop on the edge of a desk or anything else that I am aware of. I handle this laptop with the utmost of care and this morning when I opened it I noticed some "streaks" on the screen that I attributed to cleaning with my microfiber cloth the previous day. But to my horror, it was not streaks but cracks in the screen. When I called the Microsoft Support Line, the first option was for broken screens. So do you think there is a problem with these Surface Laptops developing cracked screens? Duh. Well yeah. Unless you purchased the optional extended warranty, you are going to have to pay $450 for an out of warranty replacement. Sorry Microsoft, Not going to happen. You've lost a customer. UPDATE:July 3, 2017 - I visited a Microsoft Store today. I spent about an hour with a tech who ran the battery test again on my Surface Laptop. The results were basically the same as the results gotten when the Microsoft Support online tech ran the same test. The Surface Laptop battery has a design capacity of 45,200mWh but my battery has a full charge capacity of 48,500mWh. In other words, my battery has more capacity than the design capacity. That will diminish with time of course because Li-ion batteries lose capacity slowly over time. In fact the first time I ran the battery test my battery showed a full charge capacity of 50,000mWh so it has already lost some of that capacity just in the short time I've had the laptop.The most recent run of the Battery Test indicated an estimated battery life based on my usage pattern of 7:13:43 which is essentially what I mentioned I get in my review. The estimated battery life based on the design capacity of the battery is only 6:44:12. The tech basically admitted that the touted 14.5 hour video loop statistic that Microsoft touts is something that no one will get in real life usage. The takeaway is that there is nothing wrong with my battery or with my laptop. The laptop simply does not get anywhere near the advertised 14.5 runtime. So if you are expecting 11, 12 or 13 hours of runtime, you will be disappointed. As for the laptop magazines that run tests that indicate exaggerated runtimes, be very wary. Even Wired magazine agrees that 9-10 hours is a more realistic expectation although I've never gotten close to 10 hours.UPDATE: July 1, 2017 - My review states my overall impressions of the laptop. What I want to update is my great disappointment in the battery life. Microsoft is marketing this as having up to 14.5 hours of video playback (tested using Windows 10 Pro so you would assume that Windows 10s would have slightly better battery life.) The reality after using this for nearly 2 weeks is that I am only getting 7-7.5 hours of battery life. My use of the laptop is mostly word processing, email, Browsing Amazon, Spotify and occasional YouTube video streaming. I contacted Microsoft Technical Support and had a 1 hour chat session where the technician actually ran a screen sharing session on my laptop to check and change settings to help optimize battery life (such as turning off Hey Cortana setting.) He even ran a comprehensive battery usage report which indicated detailed battery use statistics for the previous 3 day period of time. What was gleaned from that was that my battery is discharging at an average rate of 12-15% per hour. Well, do the math. At that rate of discharge, there is no way you'll ever get 14.5 hours of battery life. I feel the whole 14.5 hour of battery life is a misleading metric that is only remotely possible under unlikely circumstances. I purchased this laptop primarily because of the touted long battery life. Now that I've had the Surface Laptop long enough I am able to conclude I will never see anywhere close to the 14.5 hours battery life claimed in the marketing hype. I am very disappointed, I routinely get no more than 7.5 hours of use before needing to recharge, and in some cases only 6.5 hours on a full charge. While I am very happy with the speed of the laptop and gorgeous design, the battery life is not at all meeting my expectations. That is why I am reducing my rating to 3 stars.---- This is a review of the Microsoft Surface Laptop (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB) - Platinum.I'm having a real love-hate relationship with this laptop. First let me give it some love...What a gorgeous laptop. It is thin, lightweight and has excellent build quality. There are no seams on the shell of this laptop. It looks like it was machined out of a solid hunk of aluminum. The laptop is rigid and does not flex. I can hold the front corner of the laptop and it feels totally solid in my hand.The display has touchscreen capabilities and has a 3 x 2 aspect ratio, like the good ol days. The touchscreen is very responsive with no perceptible lag. You can use a stylus with the touchscreen if you wish but the screen only goes back so far and can not be folded underneath the laptop as a would be able to do with a convertible laptop. Pixel density is 201ppi with the screen resolution of 2256 x 1504. That makes it great for working on documents and writing. But with a 3x2 aspect ratio, you may be bothered by the black bars that will be visible on the top and bottom areas of the screen. The display has gorilla glass to give it added strength. The display does have significant glare if used outside or light from windows or lights. I find that I sometimes have to choose my work position carefully to avoid glare. The screen is bright and sharp with excellent color.The only ports are a USB 3 port, a Mini Display Port and an audio output jack, all of those on the left side. The right side has the Surface Connect Docking & Power Port. The AC adapter is small and has a USB output for charging (it is not a data port.)I really like the Windows Hello face recognition feature for unlocking the laptop. It works quite well generally speaking but low light and strong backlighting can render it useless in which case you'll have to unlock the laptop using your PIN. Not a big deal.The trackpad is excellent. One of the best trackpads I've used. I also like the feel and look of the somewhat controversial Alcantara fabric that surrounds the keyboard and trackpad. It feels good when you rest your hand on it, but I do wonder whether in time oils from my skin will cause it to get shiny, collect dirt and who knows what. I'm on the fence about the Alcantara fabric.The laptop has plenty of cons. First and foremost is the fact that there is nothing upgradeable on this laptop. What you get is what you get. This concerns me greatly. It basically means you have a $1200 throwaway computer once the battery loses it's ability to hold a charge, a fate common to all Li-ion batteries. Unless Microsoft has some magical way that nobody knows about to open the laptop up and replace the battery this is a huge consideration. I'm also not happy that there is no SD Card slot. Since there is a USB 3 port, you can certainly use an external USB hard drive or external SSD drive but still, I'd like to have an SD card slot.The lack of USB-C is also something I don't understand. This is the future of USB and the lack of USB-C seems like a big omission to me.Now let me address my thoughts about the Windows 10s operating system. I'm really conflicted about this. Windows 10s limits your ability to download apps outside of the Store. Microsoft didn't even have Spotify in their Store until recently. I'm encouraged that more and more apps will be added to the Store but am dismayed that some apps that I used to use regularly on my other Windows laptop, iPad and Chromebook, like iTunes, Chrome Browser and YouTube are not available in the Store.Another peculiar obstacle is that you cannot change the default search engine (Bing) that the Microsoft Edge Browser uses. A workaround is to navigate to the search engine of your preference then save that page in a tab and access it from the tab bar when you want to use it.Otherwise there is not that much in Windows 10s that hobbles the laptop. If you want you can upgrade (and later downgrade back to 10s) to the Windows 10 Pro version and have the full windows experience. Also keep in mind that in theory 10s should give you slightly better battery life. The reason given to me by Microsoft Tech is that 10s eliminates certain background processes from occurring which would normally occur with Windows 10 Pro. I've not noticed a measurable difference in my use of the laptop, but I assume that it will depend on what you've installed and how you use your Surface Laptop.Battery life for me is nowhere near the claimed 13.5 hours. Not even close. My previous Windows laptop got only about 3.5 hours so what I'm getting from the Surface Laptop exceeds that greatly. But still, it's not even close to 13.5 hours. On a good day I can eek out maybe 7.5 hours of use before I need to plug into power.UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 10 PRO: After a lengthy debate with myself I took the plunge and upgraded to 10 Pro. It took only 2 minutes. What prompted me to upgrade was another dumbed down feature of 10s that I simply could not live with. 10s does not allow you to access the Command Line. So you are not able to even run the battery test function unless you upgrade to 10 Pro. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Now that I have 10 Pro installed I will be able to definitively report back in a week or so whether it has degraded, improved or has no influence on my battery life.I found an awesome sleeve that I could recommend. It is the Lacdo 11-12" sleeve and is quite nice, well padded and fits the Surface Laptop absolutely perfectly.Â Lacdo 11-12 Inch Water Repellent Laptop Sleeve Case for MacBook Air 11.6" New Macbook 12" Surface Pro 4 3 Asus Dell HP Ultrabook Notebook Bag, Black
I know most people cringe when thinking about Microsoft hardware. There have been some massive failures over the years. Remember around the time of the first iphone, the Windows Phones on AT&T? What a mess. Remember trying to update them? The Surface line of tablets have actually been pretty good, but in the end most people either just want a really good tablet or a good laptop. The surface laptops have filled a nice need which is a speedy laptop that is super slim and can act like a tablet as well. As long as you get the model with at least a core i5, 8 gigs of RAM and 256 SSD, the surface laptop performs great. You can hold it with 2 or 3 fingers and fits in a tablet sleeve. I have one of these myself and we have sold about 20 of them for our employees and clients and have had very few issues so far. The finish on the laptop looks nice, but it can show some fingerprints or new to be wiped off after a lot of use. The reason I am taking off a star is because of the confusion and frustration of having these laptops ship with Windows 10 S. I won't bore you with what Windows 10 S is, suffice to say that it is a stripped down version meant for large rollouts and not suitable for most people. It's true that you can switch to Windows 10 Pro for free, but it's super confusing for people that don't know how or why they need to do that. Overall while not perfect, for the price the surface laptop is a great choice.
This really is an excellent product from Microsoft, proud owner of this machine since August 2017, never lets me down, incredible battery lifetime, totally silent and really thin! I've owned loads of laptops and this one tops them all. I also own the latest Microsoft Surface Pro (not the laptop) because I couldn't decide between these beasts. I really like them both, a really good hardware and overall goods products by Microsoft. They hit the sweet spot with these machines. Highly recommended!
Been debating for so long whether I should get this big ticket item and I have not regretted it a single time!
best choose in my life I love you Mr Bill
Wonderful laptop
Fast and light, but donât buy if you expect the touch screen to work all the time. It stopped working a few months in no matter how much troubleshooting I do it will only work for like 5 seconds after restart. Get used to using a mouse and buy a usb hub.
Excellent unit
Upgraded to the windows 10pro. Loved the laptop, good display, light, fast, perfect to bring around for work use.
Great product and great turnaround time.
It's been two days now using my new surface laptop and I have to admit it, it is a very nice laptop. It was shipped in time and I got what I expected. I recommend this seller.
Did not expect this level of performance and quality. One word i can think of to describe this item is âsleekâ?
Amazing laptop, no issues with it so far.
Great Notebook. Very happy with it.
Very nice product!
Occasional blue screens
nice experience
Best computer I've ever owned.
Super slick. Lightweight. Very stylish.
By far the best laptop I've ever had the pleasure of using. speed, weight and power are perfect.
I think the screen is easy to leave the fingerprint.
The device is great but there is a problem with the touchpad
My wife loves it! Using it 8 hours a day and not one problem. Super fast and the display is as sharp as our ipad retina display
Excellent ProductThanks
Great Product
looks great and is very fast for what i need it to do.
Love it.
Very Satasified!
Great computer. I got it for work and it is so nice. Good battery life, very light and easy to take places, good quality.
I Love this Surface Laptop but I only use it in tablet mode. I'm sure there are lots of things it does but I mostly use it to read news and surf the web.As I get more comfortable with it I'll find other uses for it. I highly recommend Microsoft Surface Laptop/Tablet.
Overall it's a very nice laptop -- light, thin, with a very nice screen and a great keyboard. I'll just mention one downside: the i7 version gets HOT, uncomfortably hot to leave it on your lap (especially if you're wearing shorts!). I'll look for an option to slow the processor while I'm running it on battery, which might reduce the heat a bit without killing performance. All thin laptops have this issue, but just wanted to point it out.
First one I received fully crashed within 4 months, Microsoft has the worst customer service I've ever dealt with. Amazon was great to deal with and sent a replacement, love the computer when its working, hopefully the second one lasts longer than 4 months
To start off, I was supposed to get a $200 gift card for the purchase of this item, which I didn't, and Amazon would not work with me regarding the promotion (which is the only reason I considered buying this laptop). I will not judge the actual item based on my poor experience with Amazon.This laptop is great. I took naturally to the touchscreen, but you can function on the laptop without the touchscreen (I realize some people do not like to "ruin" the screen). Some things may bother you though.NO CD ROM. I lucked out in that I could download all the previous apps I had, but if you require a CD, you will need to buy an external CD ROM drive to run the apps, and to burn CD's.ONLY 1 USB PORT. So I had to buy a splitter. Personally bought it to be able to use a mouse and keyboard, although I find it comfortable typing on the laptop's keyboard.Overall, I've had it for over a month and I love it. No major problems, very fast so long has you have a decent internet condition. I have a lot of apps and files that I transferred with no problem and the computer is still running great.
First off, let me share my wife's testimony, "This is the laptop of my dreams." She's the one using it most these days, and has had a few clunkers over the years, so is thrilled by how well this works. I use it on occasion too, and I'm also the one who set it up, and deals with tech issues in our house. First, the two (literally just these two) complaints: the vent near the bottom back can get pretty hot if it's on your lap and if it's on your lap and you open it up, the screen might pinch your thighs. Other than those, this is really flawless for its purpose. Some have critiqued it for not allowing upgrades or personal fixing, which I get as I've repaired more than a few laptop hardware issues. But, very few people have an interest or capability for doing that, and the tradeoff is how thin and light this is.It's not a gaming laptop, it's a productivity laptop and for that, it's wonderful. My personal main laptop is aÂ Dell XPS9350-10673SLV 13.3" 3200x1800 Laptop (Intel Core i7-6560U 2.2GHz Processor, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SDD, Windows 10 Microsoft Signature Image) Silver, and that's what I'm comparing this Surface laptop to. I have pictures which show the relative size. The Surface is more square, providing a larger overall screen, it's also thinner and lighter, not surprising given that it doesn't have near the same specs as the Dell. That said, my Dell is mostly overkill as I tend to keep the resolution on it from max because it's too much for too small of a space for most things (except watching movies) and it has a mediocre battery. The Surface keeps up with almost every task, and if it can't match the Dell 13 on heavy demands, that's not a problem most of the time. The reality of the Surface is that it works, it worked great out of the box, with easy set-up, and continues to be an entirely problem free experience. I would echo the recommendation of others to do the free upgrade from the Windows 10S that this comes with to get it to the regular Windows 10. A few minutes of extra setup time can save some bother and allow more freedom later on. Painless to do, as was the whole process. My wife uses this for browsing, netflix, and also her work-from-home job of captioning, which requires good video and audio. The audio on this is strong and the video is spectactular. The touch screen works fluidly as does the touchpad. This laptop allows us to use it for what we need it for, in ways that are much more user-friendly than anything else I've used. I still personally prefer my Dell 13 for its larger hard drive and more memory. I also like the Dell for having a USB-C, and am surprised Microsoft decided against that. Battery life is really strong, going all day really. This is a perfect work or school laptop, really allowing to maximize productivity without sacrificing anything. It's not the best for hardcore gaming, but that's not it's purpose. If you need a capable, trustworthy, easy to use laptop, this is a very good choice.
Definitely received a used Surface Laptop. Box had been opened and the laptop was dirty from use. Doesn't seem to have any scratches and seems to work fine. It would be beneficial to list this as a used item or a refurbished item in the description.
Love this laptop. Very thin and lightweight and the system works very fast. I would purchase this brand again in the near future.
EDIT 12/02/17-- I have returned this item to purchase the next model up (i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and a 256 GB SSD). While the base model was fast and was fine with my normal tasks, I couldn't get over the 4GB of ram at this price range. I returned the laptop because I'm afraid that a few years down the road, this won't be enough memory to last. I purchased the next model up from microsoft's website as it was on sale. For an extra $200 I get the better, mid-tier, model and peace-of-mind with the 8GB of RAM and the bigger hard drive. I highly recommend that if you're going to spend this much money, save up a little more and get the mid-level surface laptop.To preface, I bought this computer at my local best buy for $900, and it came with a microsoft Arc bluetooth mouse (it's awesome). I purchased the base model with an i5 processor, 4 gb of RAM, and a 128 gb SSD. I bought this laptop because the look of the computer really struck me. As for the internals, at $900 you could probably get a better laptop. The processor so far appears to be good, and the SSD is blazing fast.The only thing that concerns me, is the 4 GB of RAM. Only having chrome open, with two chrome tabs the memory is already at 50% usage in task manager. I didn't buy this laptop to be a work house and do crazy video editing or gaming, I bought this to do simple things like browse the internet.The screen is insanely clear, I compared this to my macbook pro retina early 2015 and I actually prefer this screen over my mac. The keyboard is nice to type on, and the audio/sound of the laptop is more than adequate. The laptop itself is very light and easy to move, it reminds me of a macbook air.I'd say that, if you are considering this laptop, do your research and know what you're getting into. It's an expensive computer, but it looks DAMN good. If you only plan to use this laptop to use chrome and do other basic tasks, I would recommend the base model.P.S. None of these computers have scalabilty. Meaning you can't purchase more RAM or a bigger hard drive and install it.
I love it, so far! Quite easy to convert to Office 10 Pro if you already have it on another machine. Thanks Microsoft! Thanks to a quick internet search, I didn't even have to call my brother-in-law to help!
Exceptional laptop. Very light weight, fast and just works great.
just as advertised
So far, one of the most beautiful computing devices I have owned so far. That's a real statement considering I have owned more than 15 laptops in the past decade.The screen is a stunner, touchpad and keyboard are simply fantastic and the sound is surprisingly loud and clear. The ports leave a lot to be desired but isn't a deal breaker. Although I have yet to confirm true daily performance and battery life, so far it has been overwhelmingly positive. I only felt this when I had ordered the Dell XPS ultrathin but was quickly reminded of its deal breaking limitations.You'll want to show this off and will equally enjoy using it as your daily driver. Definitely remember to use the free upgrade to Windows 10 pro until the S version has a store that is well populated with the most critical windows apps for power users and general users alike.
Disappointed to find that this product was used, box had been open and it had scuff marks on it. Understand that itâs a good price but it doesnât say anything in the description about the item being a return or used. BUYER BEWARE
workhorse little laptop
Guys this computer died on me 3 months after I bought it and is no longer eligible to be returned or have free product support. For real????? I guess I'll take it in to a Microsoft store and see if they can do any better for me. A HUGE DRAG.
Love the laptop, it looks great!
The color on the device is fading. Need to return to the manufacture for a replacement.
Gift, he loves it
Great laptop. Even though it's only got one usb. It blew my LENOVO out of the water with the features and software included. Great stylish machine.
Love this laptop.I had a Surface Pro, but hated it due to the small screen size, small battery, and substandard keyboard. This laptop takes all the best features of the Surface Pro and adds to it. Sleek and slim form factor. Spectacular screen. Good battery life. The only slight knock is a lack of ports, but this isn't an important factor for me.
Great little laptop, nice screen resolution and fast processor. My only issue is it only has one USB plug and no SD card slot
****UPDATE AFTER 5 MONTHS OF USE****I still really like this laptop, but a few issues have arisen that I wanted to mention. First, the laptop shuts off at 6% battery, not when it gets down to 0%, and then once it shuts off, I have to wait about 2-3 minutes after plugging it in for it to boot up. So that's really annoying, especially if I'm in the middle of something. Also, inexplicably, the brightness keys stopped working. These are not huge issues, but little annoyances on a laptop that's still quite new.*****Original Review Follows****I have been using this laptop for about a month now and I absolutely LOVE it. Itâs my first Windows laptop in a long time---Iâve been using Macs for quite a while---and this is really fantastic and feels like a big upgrade over my Macbook Pro.There are so many things I love about it, so Iâm just going to go through them. The battery life is excellent. Itâs very thin and light and sleek; basically itâs visually beautiful. I adore the touchscreen---I thought it was going to be kind of gimmicky but itâs super responsive and a nice feature. The speakers are amazing, and thatâs probably where I see the most notable difference between this computer and my Macbook---the speakers and sound is just ridiculously good. Oh, and the facial recognition for login is a neat feature.The ports are decent; I personally find the lack of an HDMI port a little annoying but that might not be an issue for most people. Thatâs actually the only real negative for me, so if thatâs not an issue for you, you might not have any negatives.I have to admit that having used a Mac for so long, I was a little worried about how I would find the Windows OS, but I found it really easy to pick up, and in just a few weeks I feel totally used to it. This computer is fast, responsive, and instinctive.I absolutely love this laptop and have no regrets for giving up my Macbook for it. Love, love, love it.
I've been a devoted Windows user since the early 90s. In parallel, and in counterpoint, I've also cycled through countless Windows laptops over the years, including Compaq, HP and Dell, and often been disappointed with the longevity of the machines. I nevertheless retained my affinity for the Windows operating system---so much so that when I purchased a MacBook Pro last year, I partitioned the disk and continued operating under Windows 10. I therefore greeted news of the Surface Laptop this spring---with its sleek and unitary design, and integration with other Microsoft products---with great enthusiasm. At last, I thought, the hardware would rise to the level of the software. The Surface Laptop would be Microsoft's answer to Apple.Alas, upon buying the machine (indeed, the highest-end model), I found myself severely disappointed.First of all, it ran noisy and hot right out of the box. Second, I could not even obtain a full-screen display on a standard Samsung external monitor (a defect which could not be resolved through a lengthy call to Microsoft Tech Support). How could Microsoft overlook such a basic requirement?After several hours of struggling I put the machine back in the box and returned it for a full refund. From Microsoft, I expected much better.
BitLocker recovery error on the very first boot. Had to return it.
I purchased this computer a little over a month ago and I absolutely loved it. But then a week ago I turn it on and the screen doesn't show a picture. The Microsoft icon comes on and then nothing. The keyboard still lights up but the screen is completely blank. I have my personal information on it so I can't even send it in under the warranty unless I want that information to be exposed potentially. Very upset at the quality of this product.
My 48 hours review of the New Microsoft Surface Laptop with my Pros and Cons...I originally planned on ordering my PC from Amazon but I ended up placing my order directly through the Microsoft Store and doing an in-store pick up. I was able to receive a 10% student discount so it made the price lower than anywhere else.I went with the Graphite Gold i5, 8gb, 256 - this configuration meets all of my needs since I don't do any gaming or do I run any heavy programs. My use will be web browsing, school and business use with Office 365, some light photoshop or camtasia every now and again, and streaming video so this compute meets all of my needs. I upgraded it to 10 Pro right out of the box since I don't want to be limited to Windows Store Apps only.The Alcantara wrapping is OK, I can see it getting very dirty and showing wear and aging at the 6 month mark, Microsoft says to just keep it clean by regularly wiping it downs using a damp lint free cloth. I personally will have this laptop connected to a docking station while at home and use a wireless keyboard and mouse along with a bigger monitor connected via hdmi from the mini display port so I am not that concern with it the Alcantara getting dirty and faded. I will only type on it directly when I am at school and I usually take hand written notes on legal pads so I'll make sure to keep it clean. Also with the Microsoft Complete for Surface Laptop you can get 2 yrs of coverage from damage and issues.Pros ++ The touch screen is excellent! The touch screen is really great and has works flawlessly so far.+ The screen and the resolution is excellent, the picture quality and brightness is the best of any computer I have owned and it should be as this has the highest resolution screen.+ The built quality feels premium and heavy with the aluminum casing.+ The Windows Hello Facial Recognition was a big selling point for me, it works great and you will have hands free sign-in.+ The speeds seems faster than the 15" laptop I replaced which also had an i5 from an early generation at 3.2. That PC is still working perfectly I just wanted a new laptop.+ The keyboard is nice with 4 adjustable black light settings (off, low, med, high) and feel while typing is so quality and smooth.Cons -- The color could have been more vibrant with a bit more pop, I think I would have like the cobalt blue color better. But it is still a nice color.- The touch track pad sucks! Maybe I have to make some adjustments to it but so far it's too sensitive and responsive doing other things on its own I did not want.- Cost, it's a bit on the higher end. It is a premium product without a doubt so I guess you have to pay a little extra for that Microsoft quality. It's the same price as the 13" Macbook Pro which I considered but ruled out because I prefer Windows.Another beautiful option to consider and the one I had to think about for a few weeks is the new HP SPECTER x360. That is a gorgeous computer with higher specifications for the same price. You can get a i7 a better graphics card and the same premium look and feel of quality with an aluminum body. The main reasons I decided on the Surface Laptop was the Windows Hello Face Recognition.
The fact that this product was Microsoft 10S was the reason I declined to keep it. I would have preferred Microsoft Home or business.
Slim, light, easy to navigate
For incorrect description. Office does not come with 1 year subscription.
nice laptop
Beautifuly crafted product.
I ordered my model from Best Buy, as I will start university and wanted a reliable, convenient, and dependable laptop for college years.And I love this thing, it's light, powerful, and with the large update and upgrade to Windows 10 Pro I haven't had a problem with this computer. I purchased the Surface Dock for this which truly transforms it to a desktop computer you can rely on, so this will come in handy when I come to work at home and could use the extra ports and power.The battery is great however the 14 hours part is misleading! After lightly browsing Fire Fox, upgrading to Windows 10 Pro, and setting the option to best battery life, low brightness, etc. The battery only lasted about 5 hours before getting to 30%. I notice depending on what you are doing, battery performance will vary greatly, form streaming, running programs, having multiple browsers up, etc. But the battery still is great.This laptop has an excellent design, this is by far the best touch screen I've used on any computer, which will come handy if I ever need to draw quick notes in the future.CONS:-Other colors not available for the more powerful models-Screen wobbles when you touch the screen, so if that will bother you look to getting the Surface Pro-Price. It's rather common sense to not get 4 GB in 2017 if you're spending 1000+ on a laptop, so be prepared to cough up a to of cash for this. I myself spent 1500+ dollars at Best Buy with a 10% discount... I am not rich, I had to save money all summer, but it was worth it.-You won't be able to upgrade parts on this laptop or do home repairs, so MAKE SURE you get the specs that will last through four years (I assume most getting this laptop are fellow college students such as myself) and consider you may one day have to send this in for repairs. However the superior build quality makes me feel comfortable that the only way this could break is if it were my fault or I was really unlucky/careless.-No USB-C-Mini-USB, but no HDMI or USB-c...? Really Microsoft? I've always loved and used your products but come on. If you're gonna make us use all the extra dongles, at least include them!-One USB slot, NO memory card slots!Other than that, make sure to watch reviews from various trusted YouTube Channels such as from Dave Lee and Linus Tech Tips to make sure this is the Laptop you need and want!
What can I say? From the leather like feel of the palm rest, to the amazingly vibrant screen, to the crazy battery life, this is one darn good machine. Battery Life - I work in Word, Excel, Outlook and OneNote all day long, and using those programs (with Wi-Fi & Bluetooth on, Display at recommended, and power at recommended) I am receiving 16-18 hours of battery life. When I browse the internet in my free time I get closer to 12-14 hours, so high internet usage will drain your battery faster, but still, those are some amazing numbers.Display - Bright, vibrant colors. I have never had a problem reading anything, even outdoors.Keyboard and trackpad - there is a tiny bit of keyboard flex, but the keys are fine, and the trackpad is wow. The same glass trackpad as the Surface Book (read amazing)OS - I have yet to require an app outside of the Windows Store, but if you do, grab your free update to Windows 10 Pro.Graphics - can do basic gaming, but no powerhouse.Overall - great machine
Best laptop for looks and performance. The fan is only noticeable when I put my ear up to it, even while living in Phoenix! It feels amazing to carry, especially for a student.The battery life is the best I've seen. WAY better than my Surface Pro 3. By the time I open the lid all the way, Windows Hello has already recognized me and logged me in with no wait time at all. The laptop is lightweight, and performs snappier than my Surface Pro 3 i7. The screen looks amazing, and the touch is incredible especially for how slim the screen is. The keyboard is surrounded by amazing fabric that is light on your wrists while typing (no it doesn't stink and hasn't changed colors) and the keys with 1.5 mm travel feel like a premium keyboard. I have loved this laptop for the week of using it for my junior year in college. Great purchase and well done Microsoft.
This is a Microsoft laptop. The description says it comes with Windows and Office, two Microsoft Products. One would think that it is just a 30-day trial subscription. And, they want you on Windows 365 and Office 2016--the latest Microsoft items. As a consultant, I need a computere that is on the same platform as my client. Microsoft Customer Service tried to figure out how I could get Office 2010 versus 2016....regardless, when we were close to thinking we might be successful, I asked the representative to stay on the line to make sure it worked. They hung up. It didn't work. Relied on my former IT husband to Google his way around the issues. It is not a great sync with my dear beloved Mac. I've been using HPs/Compacts in the last three jobs. My parents have issues all the time with their Surface, I blamed it on old age. They blame it on frequent updates and having to resolve issues because of the updates. Go figure.
This little laptop is amazing. I received it at the same time I bought a Dell Ultrabook, and it will replace my wife's Lenovo laptop that is dying. Externally the laptop has a minimalist styling, lots of aluminum with a tasteful Microsoft logo. It's a little heavier than my ultrabook, which makes sense as the ultrabook is all plastic, and no touch screen. The screen on the Surface is sharp and beautiful. Setup only took a few minutes. I was disappointed when I tried to install Chrome though, and the the pre-installed OS wouldn't allow it. Luckily it did prompt me to switch to regular Windows 10, which I did. Since then I was able to install my normal software suite. The machine is incredibly fast and quiet. It doesn't heat up the way our old Lenovo did. The camera is very high quality as well, my wife's relatives have all commented that her video quality has improved alot. I really like having the touch screen, as I use a tablet daily. I found myself toughing other laptop screens out of habit, with nothing happening...My wife and I are very happy with this high quality laptop, it's a great upgrade to our older equipment.
when I get it, and update my system, then it has no response any more, the screen and keyboard still have brightness, could anybody told me what happenedï¼ï¼ï¼ï¼
TODAY, IT IS 2/22/18 AND I HAVE HAD THIS LAPTOP SINCE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER 2017, AND IT WORKED LAST NIGHT, AND THIS MORNING IT IS DEAD. WTF? what do I do now???
I switched from Windows to Mac about 5 years ago. I swore I would never go back. I've been gotten increasingly annoyed with being in the iOS/Mac operating systems. About twice a month, I get prompted to change my iCloud password on my iPhone and then when I change it and go to use my MacBook Pro, I get flooded with "login keychain" error messages that I can't make go away. And then constant reminders to change my passwords even though I already have. In one of these frustrating moments, I happened to wander into a Microsoft store and landed in front of the new Surface laptop. I was pretty blown away. Great looking machine; very comfortable to use, and FAST. After hemming and hawing, I bought one - the basic $799 i5 model w/ 4 GB RAM and 128 SSD. I am beyond thrilled. I immediately downloaded the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. I have never experienced such a smooth, effortless, fast computing experience. This thing is great. They got this one right. Now going back to my MacBook seems like a downgrade!
My favorite laptop in years. Love the facial recognition login, and love the feel of the fabric. Looks sleek, i7 feels like it was worth it. Software dev is no problem with this laptop - I have a web server, sql server, etc... all going at once, no problem.
I am going to preface this with the statement that I am not a tech nerd or even remotely tech knowledgeable. I can only really comment on the laptop as I see it and how it performs for me. Please feel free to look at other reviewers if you want more technical information. The outward appearance is absolutely stunning. The casing has a solid sturdy feel that is a major improvement from the plastic cased laptops I've had over the years. It is very sleek and the lack of screws and venting make for smooth, uninterrupted lines. There is fabric on the deck and I have to say that it's one of the best highlights of the machine. Normally I end up with sweaty or sticky palms/wrists when typing for an extended period of time, but not anymore. The laptop also generates far less heat than any I have ever used before. I don't have to put it on top of a pillow when I'm sitting on the couch and it seems to stay pretty cool to the touch. The keypad and track pad are total stunners on this machine. Both seem almost perfect in their response and tactile feeling. I like the back-lighting adjustment feature for the keypad so that I can conserve battery power when using it at night. I am also impressed with the speakers and how they are located under the keyboard, keeping the deck looking sleek and slimmed down. They do put out very good sound for laptop speakers too. I have noticed people complaining about the lack of USB-C ports.......I don't really know what that is. This machine has enough for what I need to use, and I am assuming for general day to day use it will suit people just fine. The speed and performance are also on the higher end of what I am used to for general computing/word processing and other type of functions. I have a TV and a tablet already, so I am not using this for gaming or movie watching. I think that for most people who want a computer for general day to day use, this will be perfect fit. The last bit is about the OS. I have to agree with other reviewers on this portion.....it's not very useful at all. It is really the only negative thing I have to say about this laptop, and it's easily remedied anyway. Overall, if you are looking to upgrade to something that's high end, without dealing with too high of a price or more machine than you actually need, this Surface has it all. I feel like I get the aesthetics of a Mac with the familiarity and ease of use in a PC.
This computer is very comparable to the MacBook. There are a few features that we saw as it's best.-Very light and slim, makes for easy carry.-Speakers- They work very well, especially compared to the MacBook's quiet speakers.-Touch Screen is very easy to work and manage.-The key board has a nice surface and makes it easy for typing and resting hands on.-The charger cord doesn't seem to cause any fraying at the computer connection.-At this point, it runs up fast and smooth.-The APP options makes it super easy to jump to your favorite show, check email and other items.The negatives of this computer are the following:-There are no Hard/Protecting Cases made for it yet, which could be a problem especially for my household size.-The charging cord is pretty short. (I did not review to see if a longer size was available.)-The battery seems to be a good battery, however when the computer is not on battery save mode, it tends to die quick.-While on Battery save mode, the screen seems to be darker than what would be requested of our norm. (This could be a personal preference.)Overall, I highly recommend this computer. We are a MAC family and tend to steer away from other products. This computer again seems to be the closest Microsoft computer that we have touched that can compete with MacBook. We will be curious to see how long it's life lasts.
This beautiful laptop came with a nasty surprise. Sometimes it get super hot down the keyboard and feels as if it gonna explode. Really scared of using it while hot and always have to stop my work and shut down the machine. A little search on google reveals that a lot of people are complaining about this problem and Microsoft is unable to find and fix this bug. A laptop with such an extreme heat-up issue usually has unfortunately short life span.
For my purposes, this is the best Windows laptop under $1,500 right now. I bought this laptop about three months ago and it has been my regular machine for work. I am absolutely not going back to the old work laptop (HP 820 G3) and don't think I'd take the other Surface offerings.Things I adore:The 3:2, high-resolution touchscreen is hands down the best screen for getting things done on the go. This blows the prison issue HP Elitebook 820 G3's 16:9 screen out of the water, and, to my untrained eye, is as bright and precise as my 2017 Macbook Pro (used for home use - I like separation of church and state). The 3:2 aspect ratio is magical for the usual trio of Outlook, Excel, and Word.Things I like:In terms of form factor - this reminds me a lot of an older Macbook Air. It's just about the right size, and is featherweight. I'm satisfied with battery life, speakers, and performance. Docking (with one exception, mentioned below in the "things I hate" section) is easy and works every time.Things I don't like:The keyboard (lots of pressure necessary to type - much prefer a ThinkPad up to and including T420 keyboard), and general surroundings in alcantara. One of my cars has an alcantara headliner and pillars - which is great because I never touch them. The gray alcantara is begging to get dirty and I think I'm already seeing a bit of a shadow where my right palm rests.Would love a second USB type A port, and would love to have a Windows laptop that doesn't have coil whine. There's a hint of it if the room's silent - nothing like the Dell XPS 13 tried out and ended up returning last year.Things I hate:I'm forced to run a custom Windows 10 Enterprise image and I have scaling problems. My two external monitors are connected via a Surface Dock - two Planar specials at 1440p. I run the laptop at 125% scaling, and the monitors at 100%. No matter which Surface display/dock/whatever driver update I perform, I still have issues upon docking and undocking, that requires me to log out and log back in.
The real grabber is the 13.5-inch screen resolution of 2256 X 1504;it catches yur attenion and won't let go. Your eyes will be attractedto it as if there was a magnetic pull.Then we proceed to a possible deal-breaker, the operating system.Win10S (S for Student) has security upgrades, but sprouted warts;you are limited to software packages available from MicroSoftApp store only. The corporate honchos believe this restriction willmaintain security, and to an extent, they may be correct.You will discover that Chrome will not run, while MS Edge will.Thus, you must make adjustments to Win10S; it will not accomodateall your wishes.Upgrade to Win10 Pro is an option for an additional $50, although it ispresently a free option. The Surface pen is a $99.99 extra-costaddition that was once included in earlier Surface versions. Strangely,Adobe apps can't run in Surface, so your creativity might be stuntedby this restriction.Sound reproduction is excellent, a real surprise considering Surface'sultra-thin case. Audio is really enhanced when the Surface resides ona wooden table.Another plus is the striking cosmetics of Surface - gorgeous. TheAlcantara fabric on the console is a matter of personal taste; it mightenhance your experience; it certainly won't detract from it.Surface is ideal as a portable, take anywhere laptop with functionalityof a tablet. Typical battery life is 8 hours. Wireless connectivity isautomatic, hassle-free.You are limited to a single USB3.0 port, though, which you may appreciateif you travel light. Touchpad performance has really improved the pastdecade. Tracking is precise, and clicks are positivem and no more wanderingcursors.Will Win10S become the academic operating system of choice? Theanswer is entirely dependent on cost. The Surface will set you backapproximately $1200. I cannot imagine too many school districtsbacking programs forcing parents to pony-up that much for a laptop-tablet hybrid, especially with an operating system that cannot runmany user apps. Students won't appreciate that encroachment ontheir liberties.Bottom line: Win10S has superior security features, but uers candownload and run only MicroSoft App store distros. The Surfaceplatform is a joy to admire and handle; you will likely take iteverywhere. Its cosmetics, audio, and graphics resolution arestunners.I believe MicroSoft has almost upstaged the industry, includingApple, with new generation Surface.
I got this as a gift for taking an expensive class. It looks like the replacement for last year's entry model for the i5, 4gb/128gb memory. Based on the reviews from last year's model, this notebook has improved with 8gb memory and has an Intel 7300u cpu. While the cpu upgrade is welcomed, I wish it has the 8th gen 4 core/8 thread coffee lake cpu instead. It looks like it has the same toshiba 128gb ssd as last year. I didn't run any benchmarks, but it is zippy enough. The laptop also comes with Windows 10 Pro instead of the Windows 10 S.This notebook is definitely premium looking with its aluminum chassis and the keyboard is very comfortable to type. This notebook is quiet most of the time but makes a funny but not loud noise when the fan is in full throttle. 2 major gripes of this notebook is the lack of expanandability as this notebook has 1 usb port, no sd card slot and you can forget about servicing this notebook as this notebook is not meant to be taken apart. So you can't even replace the battery without potentially damaging the notebook.
I just bought the Surface laptop in Cobalt, I wanted the Burgundy but it was out of stock. I am a 60 year old professional who is not technologically sophisticated. I have a 17" HP laptop at home that I love, but I desperately needed something light and easy to use. I travel quite a bit and I wanted to bring my laptop to work to take notes. My 17" HP was too heavy. I tried out the Surface Pro and it is adorable but screen is too small. The HP two in ones were great and I actually bought one but turned out to be too heavy for regular back and forth to office so I returned it for this laptop. This laptop is just right, very light but I can work with the screen size just fine. I absolutely love the touch screen, and the material the keyboard is made from. It's really comfortable. The touchpad with cursor is very easy to use, though I still prefer a mouse. I'll get the pen soon.The Windows 10S that it comes with is annoying but the upgrade to regular Windows wasn't too difficult. The number of USB ports is small for all the things I like to attach, but no worries, I simply bought a USB attachment in Best Buy that has 4 ports in it for my mouse, printer, and flashdrives. I got a year subscription for Word, Excel, and Power Point but this suite does not come with Outlook which is separate. Best Buy transferred all my documents easily, but transferring everything I had saved in Outlook was quite difficult and time consuming, and it wasn't perfect but it is up and running now. I am still practicing using the new Outlook. All in all, I just love the size and weight of this laptop!.
The i5 with 8gb of RAM isn't sufficient for engineers, artists, and other heavy users, but it's probably perfect for managers and others who only do email and documents. Obviously upgrade to Windows 10 Pro (I think "S" stands for "Sham"), but the process was painful for me, requiring two MS support sessions, but they eventually figured it out.It uses the Surface base station which works extremely well, better than even Apple's offering. I have it plugged into a 2256x1504 res monitor and it can handle the extra pixels just fine. The Laptop's own display is extremely sharp and gorgeous, although some apps don't yet support high density displays, but overall it's nice. The fabric feels really good, and my palms never stick to it like what usually happens with metal laptops when it heats up. The keyboard has a great feel, but that's subjective. The touchpad isn't as good as a Macbook's, but is decent enough. The touchscreen and pen support are wonderful, even though the pen lags (it isn't for artists, otherwise gets the job done well enough).Doesn't get a full 5 because the lid is difficult to open (the magnet/hinge is too string, probably so it won't shake much when touching the screen), and Windows 10 is still very buggy. I don't like including Windows in the review, but fact is, it's a part of the laptop, so here we are.
Many thanks for you rapid shipment of this wonderful item.
This is an incredible product. I owned a mac for 6 years before this and it has totally superseded the mac. I was looking for an affordable touch screen labtop that was bigger than mac's 12 inch screen. The screen is clear and vivid, the touch screen works incredibly well. The bundle deal was such an attractive offer to get one price and have it all included. It even came with a kate spade case and a mouse that is so easy to bring around when you flatten it. I got a student discount as well. It's light, durable, and the best purchase I've ever made. better than apple, so happy with it! BUY IT!
If you're looking for a Macbook alternative, the Surface line is the go to option. This laptop has incredible build quality and feels like a tank. The hinge is perfectly tuned so you can open it with one hand, but still stiff enough to not wobble when using the touchscreen.Even though it's using last years 7th generation processor, in 2018, this is still a fine laptop. It handles most everything I can throw at it with ease, only slowing down with numerous apps open and >20 chrome tabs.If you get the machine with Windows 10 S, upgrade to Pro right away. It's free.Screen quality is top notch. Colors are vibrant, and it's bright enough to see outdoors. It also gets dim enough to use at night in bed, which not all laptops can do. The keyboard is excellent, much much better than the atrocity that is the 2016+ Macbook's. Battery life is excellent as well, ranging between 7-10 hours depending on what I'm doing.All in all, a great laptop. It's pricey, but you get what you pay for.
I wanted a sleek clamshell laptop in aluminum for while because all the kids on campus have them, but have always used Windows, so I was excited to see this come out. I bought it for productivity (word processing, creating slides for classes, programming, photo editing and light graphics design) and it has proved a fun machine to use because of the portability and good looks. I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro so I could use legacy software. The laptop has enough processing power for anything I've used it for and is nice and light. The keyboard is comfortable, the trackpad is smooth and accurate and the battery life is enough to get through most of the day with the performance and screen brightness jacked up.The screen is excellent and the build is solid. The fabric on the keyboard is holding up after four months' use and feels good.I'd be happy if they made the laptop a bit thicker put a bigger battery in it and upped the storage, but I feel that way about all my electronics. My only other minor gripe is that there is a lip at the front of the keyboard that doesn't seem to have a purpose (maybe to help opening the lid), and would be more comfortable if rounded. I had no intention of gaming on this, but as a surprise bonus, it streams my Xbox nicely.I used this successfully to expand the single USB 3.0 port to three and add Ethernet:Anker 3-Port USB-C to USB 3.0 Aluminum Portable Data Hub, with 10 Mpbs, 100 Mbps, 1000 Mbps, or 1 Gigabit Network Adapter with Ethernet Port, for MacBook Pro 2016, ChromeBook, XPS and More
I bought this laptop for my son who is a college student. It worked fine for 2 months, then he encountered an issue with the screen going black. He has to connect to another monitor in order to see the screen. He tried contacting Microsoft, they were useless.
I got burned on the original Surface when it came out (I had an RT which was horrible, so I traded for a Pro with Win8). That Surface got slower and slower with its many, many updates, to where the system was so bogged down that it was unusable. On top of that, hardware challenges began to show after a few weeks and by month three I loved it a lot less than on Day One. So I waited a few months before reviewing this laptop to see if it had similar issues.Fortunately, Microsoft seems to have ironed out a lot of the issues. This laptop may not have all the cool-hip factor of a convertible tablet, but its full-sized keyboard and solid casing are eminently practical while its feather weight and ultra-slim profile still keep it in the fashionably-cool category. Mine has and i5 processor and 8GB of RAM and that seems adept at most things I do (it's only a little sluggish with some games like Forza 6 and with Access). Were I chronically trying to do either, I would splurge for the i7/16GB, but the entry set will work for most tasks.The keyboard is responsive. My only gripe is my 30-year history of right-handed Control+Enter is busted by this keyboard's layout, which replaces the right control key with a menu key and no easy way to re-map it. It is backlight, but more a hint of backlit than my VAIO or Alienware, which actually makes it more eye-friendly in the dark. The large track pad is very responsive and reads the full range of touch and swipe options (some of which are turned off my default - weird).The aluminum case is sharp looking, though my dented pretty easily while in my laptop bag with my mouse. The power cord attach is magnetic, with a bar clip that makes aligning it a snap (ba da ch!). I will say the battery default power setting lets it drain pretty quickly, so if you're like me and use yours while flying, you may consider switching to lower-power options (this gets me from about 6 hours of heavy use to 12 - a nice leap, especially considering it's not the fastest charging device).Finally, for what it's worth: I do not like Win10S any more than I liked Win8RT. I know it makes the system lighter, faster, and more Android/iOS-ish, but it also makes it impossible to run my work software, any legacy software, and just in general I reject the idea (been using Microsoft since the DOS 3.0 days, so I guess I'm stuck in the mindset of me telling my computer what it will do, not the other way around). So for my 2 cents, just upgrade to full Windows 10 when you get it. The upgrade is free for the remainder of 2017, and only $50 beginning in 2018 (purchase via the Windows Store).
I purchased this with the Surface Dock and the dock quit charging the computer after 40 days and it is not returnable after 30 days. Very disappointed.
The purchase of a Surface laptop has been the most negative customer experience of my life. And I've dealt with banks and insurance companies.I bought the Laptop in early August and was happy at first, as it seemed like a good alternative to the MacBook / Pro. After about 45 days of light to no use, the laptop failed completely and tech support was unable to resolve, so refund / replacement was the only option.I thought about it and based on the news that had recently come out re Consumer Reports and the very high failure rate, I opted for refund, as my spidey sense told me this product had been rushed to market. I asked for a refund; as I was at 45 days vice 30, the request would have to be referred up for approval, response in 24-36 hours. Fine. A week goes by, nothing heard - I call, they advise 'your request has been denied.' Fine, I'll go with replacement, sell it on Kijiji, buy a MacBook. They send me ... a refurb. A highish end laptop fails after 45 days and MS believes a refurb is a fair trade. Now I'll have difficulty selling the laptop. I call back and say no way, not acceptable. They say 'just go in person into the store, they'll give you a brand new one.' The nearest store is 4 hours by car, can't do, have to do it via courier. They say 'We can't send a new laptop via courier, if you're genuinely not happy, ask for a refund'. I advise already tried, no success. They said, no, I'm looking at your file, a refund was never requested. So I waited for a week just to find out that first agent lied outright to me.Bottom line - I'm more than 2 weeks without a laptop, have spent in excess of 7 hours on the phone they consistently refuse to refer me to head office or any other level of customer support that might be able to authorize replacement with a new computer via courier. Apparently only Bill Gates himself could authorize such a thing, and he's busy. They have have ignored queries sent over email, Facebook and Twitter. This is what you can expect when your Surface fails.My sincere recommendation is buy a MacBook; the reliability is one thing, but the arrogance and ineffectiveness of MS customer service team is what makes me certain I WILL NEVER BUY A PIECE OF MS HARDWARE FOR ME OR MY FAMILY AGAIN. I've never had a major failure of an Apple desktop or laptop, when I've had issues with peripheral devices they have replaced even out of warranty.The product is not ready for market, the company is not willing to work with the poor suckers who got on early to try to find a good outcome. I will be buying a MacBook as soon as this circus is resolved.
We have several tablets in our family, but this is actually the first laptop we have used in a few years. The Microsoft Surface Laptop combines some of the best features of a tablet, such as touch screen capability, thin and lightweight portability, and features like facial recognition software, with some of the dedicated laptop features that I have been wanting for a while, such as a permanent keyboard and touch pad. At less than three pounds, this really is a remarkable unit that boasts the power of a PC with the footprint of an iPad Pro.There are a few features here that I especially appreciate, such as the surprisingly soft textured keyboard cover that I was not at all expecting. Not only does the speckled gray color blend nicely with the laptop exterior, but it's easy on my wrist and fingers when typing or scrolling along the touch pad. Beyond the keyboard, which is much sturdier than the portable Bluetooth keyboards that I have used with my iPad over the years (that consistently fall apart after a few months), this responsive touchscreen works just as well as my iPad Air 2. It's very easy to shift from keyboard to touch pad to touchscreen depending upon what I am working on or trying to accomplish.Although I have not used many laptops in recent years, I found this unit to be very reliable and on point based on my knowledge of what is available in the market. The 8GG RAM makes this unit quite fast and responsive--in fact one of the best I have encountered on a PC. As with most modern laptops, the hard drive is solid state which allows for greater ease and reliability when travelling. The drive has 256GB which holds plenty of video, music, and document files. I use this to supplement my larger desktop computer at home, but it is perfectly functional and has the capacity to serve as someone's primary or only PC on a regular day-to-day basis.I am in a unique position in terms of brand loyalty because I have almost excessively been a Microsoft user in terms of computers while at the time only really using Apple mobile devices. There is definitely a convergence of styles here with this laptop. In fact, just looking at the white box with its minimalist, streamlined design, I could have sworn I was opening an iPad Pro or something similar from Apple. Even the charger is somewhat reminiscent of an Apple unit (although in black). If you are traditionally a MacBook user, I think you will find plenty to like with this Surface Laptop. All in all, I was very impressed and will make good use of this at home, in the office, and on the go.
I truly wanted to like this laptop. But after buying 2 (1 from Best Buy and the other from the Microsoft Store) and experiencing the same problem, I have to call it quits. I can't find anyone else talking about this problem: there is sound distortion, and it's not a defect, it's simply an effect of the design. Let me explain.The speakers in this laptop are placed somewhere under the keyboard. When the sound is turned high up (typically 70/100 or higher), and under certain music, the sound waves coming from the speakers under the keyboard cause some of the chiclet keys to vibrate a lot. These vibrations produce high pitched buzzing noises. The kind of music I have found this most noticeable on is classic piano music. At first I thought I had a busted speaker. However upon returning the laptop and getting another with the same problem, I had to do some investigating. Eventually I found that when I touch some keys to prevent them from vibrating, the distortion goes away, and when I let go it comes back.I simply can't deal with this. It is extremely noticeable to me. Otherwise this laptop is great. It has the best keyboard of all the ones I've tested which was really important to me. Such a shame...
Perfect laptop for students, especially you already own a powerful workstation. The device is light and thin. The screen ratio is different from many other laptops, but it works really fine for reading and coding. The color is amazing.The touch screen helps sometimes, but using surface pen on the laptop doesn't give good experience. The touchpad feels smooth and supports many gestures. WIndows hello is really handy and fast.One of the speaker of my device is flawed, but i got the compensation. Some people may need more USB ports.
So far a great laptop that more than exceeds what I need in a daily work computer. Plenty fast and reliable with no issues to date. Screen is great just wish that it would open to a larger angle. Keys and trackpad are among the best I have used in a windows laptop with perfect travel and response. Combined with the dock and an external monitor it really is a pleasure to work on.
Microsoft has been really impressive recentlyâfirst the Surface Studio and now this gorgeous piece of kit. Iâm a big fan of the latest tech and the Surface Laptop is a âmust-have.â?The fancy keyboard material is quite a nice touch and the screen is very clear. Plus itâs touch screen, which makes Appleâs touch bar look even more laughable. Recommended for anyone who is disillusioned with the other offerings. Or really anyone who wants a top of the line laptop.
Let me start by saying Iâve been an Apple-only user until recently. I use my MacBook Pro for work and my iPad when Iâm traveling. Iâve been traveling more and more as of late, and I find that the iPad really canât do everything I need. For the amount of time I spend on an airplane, I need a fully functional device capable of heavier lifting than the iPad. But for the amount of time I spend trekking through airports, I need a device that I can carry easily in my shoulder bag. The MacBook Pro starts to feel heavy when Iâm on the long march between concourses. So Iâve been looking for a new computer that can replace both the iPad and the Mac, and I think Microsoft might have just created it.The Surface Laptop is very sleek. The fact that you can open it with one finger is super helpful for me as Iâm often on the phone while on my computer, and now I can use one hand for each. I also like that theyâve made it with fabric rather than just all metal. Much nicer especially when it gets cold outside; no more cold fingers from the cold metal of my computer.What I like most though is that Microsoft has optimized this device for security. The Windows 10 S operating system is such a smart idea. How great to be able to go anywhereâin style!âand not have to worry about my computer being safe from viruses.I have to say, Iâm becoming a convert. I never thought Iâd leave Apple but Iâm so impressed with what Microsoft is doing. First the Surface Studio and now the Surface Laptopâ¦I guess weâre going to be a Windows household soon!
I am switch from Macbook retina, and I noticed that the surface laptop is must lighter and Windows 10 run very smoothly on this laptop.I have a gaming laptop that has much better specs but feels slower than this one.The only problem is that the plastic touchpad is not as good as mac
The best laptop we ever owned. I bought for my wife to replace macbook air, she uses it everyday, no issue and great windows experience. I sometimes uses it for a few minutes (as second user) and windows hello logs me in quickly. In general, best laptop on market.
quicker and durable.
I will keep this plain, simple, and short. Get this laptop, if you want a laptop that just works. It's expensive, yeah. But after having this for two months, it truly feels like the first Windows Laptop that I can fully trust to last 4-6 years with no issue. Stick to the core i5 with 256 gigs of storage model if you do everyday tasks. it's the best bang for you buck model. Good luck!
Love the laptop. My only complaint is the felt cover on the keyboard area I don't care for.Also, I do not like that there is not a default DVD playing software like W. Media Player used to do, so I had to DL VLC.however, the upgrade to Windows 10 pro was free and painless. I am looking to get the pen as well. Pretty good laptop overall. My use is for heavy excel use and online school.
went from mac air to this and glad i did
Packing was awesome, computer works good and came in perfect conditions.So far everything is working well. Will update if i notice something !
This is replacing my 2012 13 Inch MacBook Pro and its a great upgrade. The core i5 is a perfect performance for what Iâm using it for, and I think Anybody could like it. Itâs design is really good, and the keyboard is the best Iâve had.
Great product product
I just love using this device. I have the i5 8GB, and it feels very snappy. Great build quality as well.
Love this laptop! I just spilled half a mug of tea on the laptop and it's fine. Appears that the fabric is waterproof like Window said!
At first, everything worked well. I upgraded to regular Windows 10 so that I can install software unlike previous Windows version. Everything worked great for 3 months. The only issue I had was the face recognition sign in, which seemed to only work about a fifth of the time. It's also a pity that the monitor wasn't 360 degrees too. However, overall I really liked the laptop. It was nice and light, and could fit in my purse really well. However, after 3 months, it just stopped working without any reason. There was no physical damage to the laptop whatsoever, I simply closed it like normal one night, and it wouldn't boot up 2 hours later. Monitor went black, and only the keyboard would light up. So while it was working, it worked great despite the iffy face recognition sign in. The touch screen was sensitive enough, and it woke up from sleep reasonably well timed. I've contacted Microsoft support and thankfully there is a 1 year warrante, however, it means they will simply just probably replace it with refurbished one. It's a bit saddening that it only lasted 3 months or so and that now anything on it will be wiped. Hopefully, the next laptop will be longer lasting. Overall, in working shape, it was relatively a 4 star. My only complaints were the face sign in, it wasn't 360 degrees bendable, and the magnetic charging chord often would fall out.
Awesome computer!
I gave this laptop to my husband to replace his big, clunky, slow Dell laptop. He took a look at it and declared it "too wimpy".. then opened it up, turned it on, and completely changed his tune. He now thinks it's the best laptop he's owned. It is small - but good things, they say, come in small packages. It is lightening fast. Husband is in finance and uses Excel. He opens up so many files at once, and does huge cut and paste between files. While his Dell would bog down and churn during these situations, the Microsoft Surface performs quickly and efficiently. Husband also loves the touch screen, though he was dubious at first. He adapted to it quickly and now prefers the touch screen to his old mouse.The laptop was easy to set up, right out of the box. The Introduction Screens walk you through setting up Wi-Fi, Cortana and a few other features. Simple for anyone. The graphics on the screen are amazing - clear and extremely high quality. We were both surprised to find no SD card port and it needs a different HDMI cable (mini display cord adapter $39). Apparently, you have to order a special (and pricey) compatible mouse ($79).We're no digital wizards or techie's. We're just folks who like to use our laptops for a variety of tasks, from watching videos and playing games (me) to processing Excel files and scrolling through online auctions (him).The fabric that surrounds the keyboard is nice, but I have to wonder how difficult it will be to clean. Another feature we don't care for is the fact you can't order up a new battery replacement. I assume you have to send the entire laptop to Microsoft for replacement. Another pricey venture, I'm sure. We both wish the tablet part of the laptop disconnected to be used independently.Pro's: it's fast, it's got great graphics, it's lightweight, it's got a touch screen.Con's: The usual accessories don't fit, pricey replacement accessories, no user battery replacement, no standard HDMI port, no SD card.It's a debate whether to give this laptop 3 or 4 stars, but the speed and graphics make up for a lot.
This comes in a box that reminds one of a big box of 1950s Christmas chocolates--and the contents are even nicer! My machine is platinum, and it looks impressive. Better than the external vibe is the inside. The screen is vivid, by any standard. The keys in the keyboard are bigger than any I have ever seen in a computer or laptop. The texture of the surface of the keyboard and mouse area reminds me of Ultrasuede. Of course, best of all, it fired with ease. Compact, but full service.
The battery is awesome this laptop is perfect for students the only problem here that its not upgradeable so you need be aware of your usage
Unfortunately there have been an array of problems since purchase. I believe this may be the particular product sold by the seller.
To respond to the 1 star review complaining about the Surface Laptop being hard to repair... You can have a solid, very well constructed machine or you can have one that's easy to disassemble and repair. Pick one.ï»?,B0727VQLGM,13.5 inches,3.1 GHz Intel Core i5,8 GB,256 GB Flash Memory Solid State,Intel HD Graphics 620
1213,I had one of these and was underwhelmed (finally sent it back). It's not fast
Happy with the item.
I have this laptop for 1 week now. everything is perfect for me except the way they built this laptop.the battery certainly isn't replaceable, it will be a problem if you are planning using this laptop for more than 3 years.I guess it will be few hundreds since they claim they will have a service for replacing the "entire laptop" for users.Well, the question is, will you pay that much for the service?
I hate this damn computer. The app store is very limited. If you are a andriod user this is not for you (smartphone). YouTube, Amazon, google drive, google maps, and most other popular apps are not available to you. If Msft would create more apps then it would be ok. Now I am looking to get rid of it. It is worthless.
Great computer in many ways. But a proprietary charger instead of USB-C is beyond stupid. A second charger will cost an obscene $80.
Poor quality.Broken after a few weeks.Expert says it's not repairable.
If your Surface device goes bad after warranty you are out of luck. I have a surface 3 that started having issues after 21 months of use. It was not abused. There is no repair service just a replacement charge of $320.00! This for a device that new was 500.00. This is completely absurd. If your Surface Book goes bad after 12 months it will be $600.00 to get it replaced and no option to get it repaired.Microsoft has reliability issues as documented by Consumers Report with 25 % of users having issues by the end of the second year. According to Consumers Reports this is much higher than other manufactures. My experience with Dell was much better for an out of warranty defect. They replaced a laptop that had a motherboard issue at no cost.My Surface 3 mini displayport does not work and it also has an issue with every USB device disconnecting then connecting again 5 times a minute when connected to the dock. This means it is continuously chirping unless I turn the sound down. I wonder what is next. Evidently Microsoft thinks this is normal.Microsoft Technical Support people have been prolite but totally useless offering no troubleshooting knowledge that I didnât already know.Out-of-warranty service fees by productâ?United States (currency US-USD)Surface Pro 3 $599.00Surface 3 $310.00Surface 3 (LTE) $310.00Surface Pro 4 $450.00Surface Book $599.00Surface Studio $899.00Surface Laptop $450.00Surface Pro (latest) $450.00
DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!!!!! IT COMES WITH WINDOWS 10S, AND IT IS TERRIBLE.
You won't be disappointed. Does exactly what it's supposed to do.
There are many reviews out there that will tell you most of the intricacies of owning this computer, but there is a thing or two I did not see mentioned before so I would like to put it out for those few people who may find them important.To start politely, if you are looking for a laptop computer, you should seriously consider this one. It has all the potential you may want. It is just that it has limitations, too.First trivia about it is that the power button is located on the keyboard. It is between other buttons, not bigger and not smaller, just one of the buttons there. It is not even the one in the corner, it is the second one from the right in the top row. You will get used to it, but the choice of the position is unexpected, at least.Much more important to me is the fact that computer is practically barely usable unless you open the Microsoft Store account. It does not work straight from the box in the way computers should. Well, it will work with what comes preinstalled on it, but nothing else. A lot has been written about pros and deficiencies of Windows 10 S so I will skip those details, but you are not going to install anything on them without Microsoft Store account. Every review on every tech site will tell you that it qualifies for FREE upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and then you will be able to install programs the way you are used to with no limitations. Unfortunately, no website mentioned that Windows 10 Pro cannot be installed/upgraded to without Microsoft Store account. In case you thought that paying serious money to get a computer with operating system should be enough, you are out of your naÃ¯ve luck. You will be able to meaningfully use that same computer only if you join the Microsoft Store club from which you may not have any intention to ever buy anything. Where is the rationale for asking gender and date of birth to open an account for upgrading to the operating system you were promised you would be able to easily upgrade to after you paid for the computer is open to discussion.Aside of that Apple-esque idea, I think the computer may be good for those who have Microsoft Store accounts and do not feel fooled by not being able to upgrade without joining the club. For the rest of us, it is a machine that could, but failed to deliver due to pre-installed software limitations.Please note, reviews of the new computer are not of the feel of the buttons or softness of the Alcantra only. They involve preintalled software and ability to use the item without having to jump through the unadvertised hoops.
Initially I bought this through Amazon but cancelled quickly when I realized Microsoft offers a student discount. So far I have had this 2 days and it has not been bad but it certainly has not been great either. I don't think I had Windows 10 S for an hour before I quickly upgraded it Windows 10 Pro. As stated before Windows 10 S will NOT let you install 3rd party applications unless they are in the Microsoft store. So that means you are stuck with limited VPN options, Edge Browser, and a ton of other limitations. The trade off is real and significant. For Windows 10 Pro you can install the programs you want; however rest assured your battery life will suffer tremendously. I was at 100% about 20 minutes ago but after moderate use (no streaming videos or music) I am down to 92%. I think it is fair to say Windows 10 Pro kills the battery life Microsoft touted as being amazing. Microsoft informs users that you can downgrade back to Windows 10 S if you choose free of charge. The touch screen is nice as is the material surrounding the keyboard. The screen resolution is absolutely on point. I have the i5 8GB 256 GB model and I have to say it is much slower than I anticipated. It looks like many others are reporting the same thing. I'm not sure the more expensive i7 would make that much of a difference. In addition, the facial recognition software to unlock your computer is inconsistent at best and I could totally see myself strictly using the pin procedure to access if it keeps up its shenanigans. All and all it is a good attempt by Microsoft, does it beat it's Macbook Air counterpart? In my opinion, no. As I am deeply entrenched in both ecosystems, Apple and Microsoft (I love both) I can say with the utmost confidence that it is a good computer but not great and certainly not worth the hefty $1299 price tag.
Everything I expected. Thanks
For the price...this unit lacks an SD reader, and HTML port. (and USB ports?)...Until Microsoft improves these models...I shall not purchase one....
Got super excited about buying the new Surface laptop and the excitement pretty much ended as soon as I took it out if the box. I won't talk about the lack of USB-C ports, or the longevity of the Alacantara surface material because Tech. websites cover that in detail. I will give you my personal everyday user experience:So opening the laptop is not easy, by easy I mean i should not be struggling to open the screen when I supposedly bought the laptop with the ebst design in the market. There is no hinge, or a little gap for you to slide your thumb in to open the damn thing.The laptop moves around a lot when placed on even slightly polished surfaces. I was at a local coffee shop and it kept moving as I was typing.I could not even connect to the WiFi at the coffee shop. I clicked on the network and it kept trying to connect me for the next 5min. Finally, after looking up an article about this problem with Surface laptop on my Iphone, I had to RESET my Wifi settings on my new laptop for it to work. It's 2017, and this is not acceptable for a machine this expensive or any tech. product no matter the cost.The screen colors are not something I am familiar with. I haven't looked too much in to that but the display has a very unfamiliar shade of white that I am not used to.The laptop is not Up-gradable, meaning 2-3 years in to the future when you decide to upgrade the RAM or storage, you can't. That's a big setback because laptops slow down with time and not being able to upgrade it will cost you well A NEW LAPTOP.So it's been about 2 days since I've had this and the day I started using it, in about 3 hours I had already ordered a Refurbished Macbook Pro, 13" Oct 2016 release date(Same Price). Now, I am just waiting for that lovely piece of machinery to show up at the Apple store so I can return this sad attempt at recreating the Macbook by my neighbors in Seattle.
Every thing looks OK, but, what is the screen size?????
here are two no go's for me:1.) No replaceable battery. Battery is glued and the device is some sort of welded together. You cant not open it without damaging the device.2.) The SSD is soldered (=not removable). this means data is not recoverable if you damage the device or if something other than the SSD fails.If you can live with this it is a decent device.
To me a computer either does everything it's supposed to or it's worthless. Trying to fix the fact that you can't search for words in email in Microsoft Outlook I was told "our engineers are aware of that problem and we are working on a solution". Unacceptable.
For starters: This item isn't prime. I purchased it because it was marked as prime, then went and paid additional $$ for it to be delivered in 1 day instead of the 2 day offered with prime. Only after purchasing and shipping was i then informed that it would take a full 7 days to get here.Only after contacting amazon was i given my refund for shipping. I still had to wait 7 days, though and was told while emailing amazon that the item would only count as prime in the state of California.That's false advertising and i'm not happy about it at all.The laptop itself, on the other hand? really great. I've only had it a few hours but i love it so far. All games i've tried have played smoothly with no issues. Gorgeous screen, much prettier than the one on my old lenovo y50-70. The biggest complaint i have is the sound...it comes out underneath the laptop, which is strange and creates a rather crappy, muffled noise but with headphones it shouldn't be an issue. overall, i'm really happy with this laptop. I still haven't had the chance to download and test the big test game for me...Ark...so i'll update this with how it runs Ark at a later date, as that game my old computer couldn't run smoothly.
I am happy with this purchase and so far zero issue with it. I enjoy the red back lit keys and has the F1 through F10 keys as well. It fired up quickly. The few games I play runs great (Empyrion is one I play most). Load time was quick. The graphics very nice too. The laptop fan settings was nice to have access to set the speed. You have full control on alot of stuff from turning on or off the onboard camera, microphone, wifi, and Bluetooth. It comes with Norton Internet security although not a big fan. I will use for now. Otherwise I would buy another MSI laptop again. The company I bought it from shipped it fine and I wish they would use more packaging stuffing it it's box. I did not receive it damaged nor the boxes it was in. Updates as the weeks progress.
My first gaming laptop. Although I really bought it for the graphics, hard drive, lit keyboard, etc. Was once into gaming, maybe I'll get back into it. So far, impressed with this laptop. Hard core gamers may have different opinions.
Arrived early and as expected from EXcaliberPC. They did awesome. But, after 2 weeks the HDD failed. I meticulously took care of this, it was only used on a desk and kept in the box when not in use. I am in the process of getting the RMA done. Apparently I have to pay for shipping one way and it will leave me without a computer for 30+ days. That is a BUMMER. I did not abuse this thing, it was a defective item. Yet I have to pay for shipping and wait for them to OPEN it up, poke around and hopefully fix it. I would rather just get a new one since this had problems right out of the gate. I have always heard good things about MSI. I guess I will see how this works out for me because I feel pretty let down and may try other brands next time.
Great gaming laptop! I often see people writing "great for the price," but this machine does not need the qualifier. The price is good, but that is not what makes the machine good. It runs very smoothly, stays cool, is very quiet, and sturdy. My old laptop simply did not have the power to run a game that my friend always wanted me to play with her FF14. I tried it and just had constant stops and starts and long lags. This machine runs it at highest graphic settings without a single hiccup. I'm very pleased and would definitely purchase another MSI machine were I in the market for another new computer. By the way, although it doesn't add anything to the way the computer operates, the red backlit keyboard is very cool! If there were anything I could say in criticism it would be that the machine does not have a DVD drive, but other than that, terrific computer!!
Great gaming laptop. Play league on high quality with 100-110 FPS. Crashed on playing left 4 dead tho, not sure why. ( probably overheated haha) but worth every penny that I spent. Iâm really satisfied with this laptop âºï¸
Really good laptop, especially if you can find the sale for $150 off. Absolutely cannot beat the value.Runs Fortnite at a consistent 95 fps with shadows and anti-aliasing at lowest setting, with everything else set for the highest setting (very powerful cpu and gpu). Has more than enough storage to hold all your games and other files. Boots up super fast.Looks great, keys are smooth, display is great.Kinda heavy, but not an issue for most people.I saw reviews saying that theirs came with dead pixels, mine did not.Definitely happy with this purchase.
What a great computer! I bought this for work, because why not ;)It is super fast and has the backlit keyboard that I love. It's sturdy to the touch, steel case is a joy to behold. Runs for about 3 hours on battery.
Real pleased with the purchase of MSI GL72M 7RDX-800 17.3" Performance Gaming Laptop i7-7700HQ GTX 1050 2G 8GB 128GB SSD+1TB SteelSeries Red KB. Just bought it a few days ago for $50 more than it is today - bummer.This computer is terrific. Nice display. Responsive. QUIET! So very quiet compared to the old PC my wife. Feels lighter than expected considering the screen size.I wouldn't get too excited about thinking it will be ready out-of-the-box as the Windows 10 updates took over 10 hours to finish. After waiting and waiting at 99% for hours and deciding to restart and use the manually selected Windows Update I was able to see a little more of what it was working on and after the last couple of hours passed and all was well.Wish we had purchased it a few days later and saved $50. Good deal right now!
this is a great computer I love using it. The speed is incredible. If you don't like the red light background for the keyboards you can switch it off or lower the setting. The only thing I would say is because it is such good quality the videos that are poorer quality show a difference when watching. as a result if the quality of the film is not the greatest it may show up more pixelated. other than that it's awesome. Another great feautire is you can turn on and off your webcam feature.
I have so many different views on this laptop. The 17.2 inch monitor is just, amazing... It's almost as if I'm using playing on a portable desktop. The graphics that come with the laptop are basically what you'd expect from a gaming laptop from a $1,000 laptop, so it's pretty much a win win. The backlit steel series keyboard and cooling is pretty great and convenient. I love it!
Aside from some configuration that I had to do myself to get the full function out of that Nvidia card, this has been a dream to use. I use it both for work and gaming at home. Outstanding performance, and a fantastic bargain.
after 1 month using and install all updates this laptop working perfect with no issuehighly recommended gaming laptop with 17 inch big screen and gtx 1050 awesome for gaming.
Best laptop I've owned to date.Love the SSD for quick system boot up.The cooling system is super quiet and efficient.Audio sound is desent.
I absolutely love my laptop. I've had it a few months now and it runs games like GTA V on high graphics with no problem. It's my dream gaming laptop.
No complaints at all - I love the backlit keyboard, the 17 inch screen and due to the OS being on the SSD drive, it starts up in seconds.
good ps
Best laptop I've own by far
Got this as a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves it. Came exactly when Amazon said it would. Well worth the money. I contacted Computer Upgrade King about a question and they were very polite and prompt will definitely use their company again.
Good performance. Very satisfied with all aspects
Good for fortnite. And great price
Great computer except the lighted key board. Pushing the space key with your thumb is near impossible.
Amazing laptop! Itâs a solid choice for moderate gaming. It does not take 10 hours to boot, as other reviews have said. The only problem is that the battery fades more rapidly than Iâve seen in other laptops, even on power saving mode. Still, itâs a great laptop; Iâm very happy with the purchase.
Bought this for hubby as a gaming computer for his graduation gift from a very difficult teaching credential program. We have only had it for 1 week, but so far it seems to be perfect. Nice strong fan sound so you know it's working hard to keep the machine cool during use, and it also spells longevity for laptop life. Red keyboard is warm and comfortable to the eye, like looking at lava, or a warm salt lamp. Very soothing. Other than the initial setup of Windows 10 which took hours, the computer is fastI Would purchase again.
Best gaming computer Iâve ever had
This is not the best product for this money, quality isnât good, maybe I got not the best. Bought this laptop 3 month ago and already have a broken pixels on my screen!
in general it's fine, but it has two things: the battery lasts nothing and when it's time to play it's time to connect the charger so the fps run well
I like alot. But didn't have cd reader
I don't know what I would do without this fine piece of machinery. Best price for a name brand gaming laptop. MSI is affordable and competes and in my opinion performs better than those ROG/Alienware for a way better price.
Great computer but battery life isn't its strongest point.
This was not the laptop for me. My son suggested it for speed and processing but I needed one for work-related tasks. The red keyboard back light was irritating to my aging eyes.The space bar did not work on mine. Returned it. The company was great about the return.
Great pc so far!
The best laptop with this price!!
Good designGood qualityThe price is reasonableeffective
Item stopped charging a few weeks later. It shows online this is a common issue with the model.
great gaming computer that does all that I need and doesn't have any issues
Love it i can download all my games on it and it's still super fast. Only thing is battery lasts like 3 hours, but that's to be expected from a gaming laptop. Screen is gorgeous and great for watching movies or playing games
It's a little too big if you want to move arround, but it's amazing.
Ilove this laptop. It hass ample ammount of space to download what ever you want and still have room to spare. This machine does great for gaming and does well under heavy loads gaming wise. The software that came with it works well for optimizing games. There are overclocking softwate that came with the machine that works well. I have not experienced any crashes yet either. All in all, 10/10 would recommend to others
Amazing Product, best laptop I've ever had. Fast and most of the recent games from 2016-2017 run on max/high settings.
Great computer, a little heavy but this is expected based on the screen sizeColors on the screens can look a bit washed out but no major problems whatsoever. I use this for Steam and Video editing and some light Photoshop and fits my needs perfectly.Battery last about two hours which is fine by me since I mostly use it on my desk.Backlit keyboard works great but the only complain I have is since the keys are colored a very dim transparent red it's a bit hard to see the keys when you don't have the backlit function on, I wouldn't like to turn this on every time I use it so this is something that sticks out for me, still is not a big nuance to give less than five stars. Solid product overall.
I finally decided to buy a gaming laptop for myself.I did alot of searching and reading, cause I wanted to get a laptop that had good specs but still fitted into my budget line.The speed and performance on this laptop is amazing!I personally don't play big games, but all my games haven't given me any trouble in playing my FPS are great!
Beware,,I have been trying to contact msi customer service for 2 weeks, with NO response.. This is unacceptable to me.
Amazing, fast and reliable
It takes so long
It is a beautiful laptop, arrived in perfect (refurbished but couldn't tell) condition. it boots up very fast, and runs in perfect condition. I can play games and do all my paper work. Surprisingly, even I opened multiple tabs and browsers, it still response very fast, no delay at all, doing much better job than my desktop (though it is old, but has i5 in it).It was a great price and I would recommend doing business with these guys
As a computer, it is okay, no complains about that. But be aware that it has no space to save almost anything in the hard disk, so when buying it don't forget to buy as well an SD card of at least 2GB to store your stuff.
I am delighted with this item, my first laptop ever. I was having issues updating but after I researched and implemented solutions updates were installed and I find this device has been a great addition for my needs. I really haven't had time to explore all of it's advantages and offerings and look forward to the discoveries. Added point: The communication from the seller has been supportive, positive, and didn't feel like just a sales promo.
It's okay. That's really it. It's a cheap, basic computer that's really only good for surfing the internet. I bought it for mainly that purpose and video chat and unfortunately if I do want to use it for video chat I'll have to get an external webcam as this one is crap. I haven't thrown away the box yet because I'm not convinced I'm going to keep it.It's got no internal room so I bought a memory card to go with it so I'd be able to store things, however it's still not even enough. Windows wants to update and it can't because there's not enough room on the drive. Riddle me this, how does a computer that doesn't have anything saved on it not have enough room to do an update?Overall, not sure I'd buy it again. I had a pretty immediate need for a computer otherwise I'd probably would save the $200 and put it towards a better and more expensive computer.
Iâm not a tech savvy guy. I would have thought a 32 GB hard drive would be sufficient to run Windows. Wrong. As other reviewers have noted, itâs not even enough space to install updates. This makes no sense to me, so I did a quick search. SSD vs HDD. . This laptop has an SSD rather than an HDD. An SSD requires much more memory to operate Windows than an HDD, but it is allegedly faster. In order to run Windows AND have some storage, the minimum size SSD recommended is 128GB. Obviously, Iâm returning it.
Not impressed. The system is fast but the vast majority of hard space is filled - weâre getting storage warning after a few days and only installed chrome. Must spend a lot of time setting up and cleaning up.
It runs way too slow comes with a bunch of useless apps which take up all the space. You don't know which ones you can delete to get more space because you don't know what they're for. Plan to return if I can.
Do not buy. The computer itself is probably fine, but the 32 GB hard drive is so small that I am unable to download and install windows updates, even after deleting some of the stuff that was included. I imagine it would make a fine Linux machine, but is absolutely unsafe to use as a Windows machine since there is no room for updates.
Love it because its super light and easy to use. A little slow when browsing with multiple pages open and storage fills up pretty quickly but other than that great buy.
Like others posted, not enough memory for windows 10, I should have read up more carefully on the specifications. I'll likely just use it to serf the nest and social media etc.
Purchase this thought it was great Specially because of the price but after being in use with in an hour suddenly the volume would go out. very disappointing ended up returning it
This laptop lacks the memory to do much of anything. I had to use my thumb drives to offload enough memory so I could update Windows 10. Microsoft states they won't provide updates past April 30, 2018 for this version of Windows 10 and they suggest downloading the updates. Well, not happening. I deleted Chrome, all games, any apps not used daily and still not enough memory available. Thinking strongly of sending this laptop back.
For starts 20 minutes in and already freezing Iâm so madUPDATE when I got the laptop it was 9339 mb and now itâs 809 mb
Product stopped working properly after two weeks.
I didn't like it.it came on but that's all.it didn't Don't want a refund.just a laptop with aCD player.
The computer stopped working little after the 30 day period. DO NOT BUY
It is so slow. And so irritating because itâs connected to WiFi and wonât work wtf
I don't find any charger
Like others have said, 4GB for Windows 10 is crazy low. It is partly my fault for not doing research, but it's also the manufacturer's/seller's obligation to make sure the OS runs properly.
This laptop should not be labeled as a 2018 model!!!â?It is so slow it reminds me of the first generation laptops that came out 15-20 years agoâ?Thereâs absolutely zero processing power, constantly freezing, no storage space... worst laptop ever!!
Great product all way through is
I ordered this product and it is so far so good!
too slow not what I expected
Muy bueno gracias
Came with no charger, how do I know it works if I can't turn it on!
so fa so good
Very inexpensive in both price and quality. Not what I had hoped for but what I should have expected.
To many added programs. Takes up over half of the memory toWork. Deleted many of the programs to get enough memory.It is quick and easy to use because of its size.
I'm not sure that it would be a good buy at $999.00 but if you watch out for specials it is a great deal. I got mine for $799.00 and at that price I think it is excellent. I bought the 128GB/4GB Ram version and it works great. One of the tasks I wanted this for was for photography editing on affinity photo. I was worried that the 4gb of ram would not be enough. I figured that if it wasn't enough i could always return it. but fortunately the laptop is holding its own. However I wouldn't recommend for video editing. Other features I really like on this are the Windows Hello feature. It works insanely well. Also, the track pad is amazing! The best I've ever seen on a PC. I didn't give windows 10 S a chance so I can't review that. The first thing I did was upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. This upgrade is available until 3/30/18 so don't wait too long if you're interested in this. After that date I read it will be a $50 upgrade.
I am an intense user and the Surface Laptop is the best laptop I owned so far. Upgraded it to Win 10 Pro since I need a wide variety of software on the machine for professional use (Image processing, CAD, etc.). The upgrade was free and easy. The keyboard is very precise and comfortable, allowing for fast typing. Mouse and touch screen very accurate. The display is crisp with natural colors. Processor and SSD performance is ample. Beautiful detail solutions like the power supply plug and the additional USB charging port in the power supply add to the appeal. And the design is clean, minimalist, beautiful.I hope I will have this laptop for a very long time!
I work in IT so I get to see/touch and go through a lot of Windows PC's, Chromebooks and tablets.This is, by far, the best computer of any sort, Mac or otherwise, that I have ever touched, seen, owned or used. It's just perfect in every way.The hardware design is beautiful. It has a solidness to it that feels Apple or Mercedes quality. The screen is beautiful, touch, and it's fast.Battery life is great, performance is great, the keyboard has a perfect travel distance and click for those of us that are rapid typists-- you won't be disappointed.It has "real" usb connectivity which is so uncommon these days. The touchpad is glass and sensitive enough that I will use it. Previously Mac was the only computer with a good enough touchpad that I was willing/able to give up a wireless mouse.I could not be more pleased with this computer, I love it to the end of the world and back. I never thought I'd be considered a fanboy of any product, but here I am.
Not my first time buying a surface product and wont be the last. Perfect for a person who primarily needs email, internet, music and media organization. I also do light picture editing from raw format and this handles that very well.
This is a great Windows laptop. I wish it had come with a little documentation (especially for how to take advantage of the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro), but Microsoft support was able to take care of that for me. It feels and performs great. I had ordered a Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 with an i7 processor, and that got too hot to comfortably use in my lap on the sofa. The Surface laptop is perfect for me.
Very nice piece of hardware. I few minor complaints: Not nuts about how the charge cable interfaces with the laptop.. not as good as the maglock system but macs use but better than the typical connector. It is short on ports. Display Port, USB3 and a headphone jack... and thats it. I wish for a built card reader when I forget to bring my USB card reader.Aside from those complaints, its great. Great keyboard, great track pad and HOLYSHITAWESOME SCREEN. Looks great and 3:2 aspect ratio is so great for actual productivity.Great battery life and highly portable size and weight.Tight integration between OS and hardware shows.. everthing just works.
Amazing product, the materials are great. Feels that it is a premium quality.The battery may disappoint you because in tech specs you can see that it will work 14.5 hours. As for me I couldn't get from it more than 8 hours.It may heat if you will play games, then you need some additional cooling.Also the screen ratio is 2x3 that is great for work. But for movies it may be not as wide as you would like.Touch screen is great, very responsible. To keyboard and touch pad there is no complaints.
Excellent build quality. I have absolutely no reservations about the Surface Laptop. I think its better than the Surface Book I own. Microsoft got it right on this one.Positives: Fabric on top of the keyboard, quiet, all metal build, small and thin, fast.Note: I would suggest upgrading it to Windows 10 Pro from Windows 10 S. Its currently free to this at this time.
I bought this for my wife to replace her older, bulky, HP laptop. It was a few years old and replacement was due. She picked this one out at a retail store and we found it on Amazon for a reduced price. She LOVES it!! So light, fast, and cute because it's her favorite color. The palm rests have a cloth feeling but they are made of some plastic stuff that's easily cleaned, the screen looks great, and the keyboard feels right... partly due to the palm rests allowing a person to rest palms on them while typing. It has a fast hard drive, it's quiet and light. I really don't have negatives to say about it except that it only has a couple of USB 3 ports. That's OK... I bought a tiny USB 3 hub and we're all good now. Definitely recommend this device though it's not cheap.
I have a very big an powerful desk computer required for my research. But for a personal on-the-road computer mostly for light duty stuff this $999 machine is perfect for me. I hope Microsoft does not destroy it with add-on's, unfortunately their past record suggests otherwise.
I've wanted a Surface computer for awhile and I'm so glad I bought it. I shopped around before deciding on Amazon. The free 2 day shipping sealed the deal for me. BB had it for around the same price but with shipping this came out less. This laptop has a very fast boot time, and the fact that Cortana really simplified the setup was very cool.
The wifi reception is crap and slower than by 5 year old laptop. Everything has been tried, including changing the router but nothing work. The download speed varies from single digits to about half the model/server rate. Microsoft support has been no help.
I've had this laptop for about three months, and this is the second laptop (after the Rose Gold MacBook), that I have looked forward to using day in and day out. It is a weird feeling, being in love with your laptop. Most of us have probably own at least 6 laptops in our lifetimes, so you can understand where I'm coming from when I say most of us use our laptops in a utilitarian sort of way: We use it because we need to, and when we don't, we just put it away without any thought. If you want a big screen, or to play games, you would use your desktop. When you want something portable, you would most likely use your tablet. When you want something on the go, we have all used our smartphone as our main day-to-day gadget. So that leaves our laptop, as more of a business machine for doing something that requires typing on the go, whether it be to reply to an important email you can't just use your phone for, or to type out something on Word or Google Docs. For many of us, browsing the Net just isn't as satisfying on our small phones, even if it is some 6.2" monster. There is something tactile, yet intangibly indescribable, about using our laptopYet, this is the first Windows laptop that makes me look forward to using it each day. The main culprit: Oh that gorgeous piece of metal and color. To be honest, if it just came in silver like its Surface Book counterpart, I would have never given it a second thought (by the way, I have that too, but its novelty has since worn off). I got the Burgundy version, which is just so unique - where else can you get a wine red laptop?? Each time I open its laptop sleeve and pull it out, I have to pause a moment to admire its chiseled look first, before propping it open and using it. Not only does it look great, it feels great too. As you run your fingers through it, you will appreciate that you have one of the most luxurious laptops ever. No that is not a hyperbole.Another thing that make it stands out: The stereo speakers underneath the keyboard is the best I have ever heard in a laptop (I am overseas right now, and my Huawei Matebook X awaits at home with its Dolby Atmos Harmon Kardon speakers, so I'll do an update soon). It is loud and immersive - it can't get too loud where it would create aural distortions, so at its peak it is just awesomely loud and clear enough. I have a keyboard protector over it, but I always take it off when I have some audio playing - yes, the sound is that good.Touchscreen laptops might be a gimmick, but having it is never a negative. It is perfect for scrolling web sites. Once you use it that way, you'll never go back to scrolling with your mouse or trackpad again.Speaking of the trackpad, it's supposed to have the Windows Precision software aspect, but it still is goofy most of the time. Scrolling, switching, zooming, etc., still isn't as good as any MacBooks.And speaking of the keyboard and keyboard cover, key travel and sponginess are excellent. However, the keys are a bit more slippery than I would like, so I definitely recommend one of those gel keyboard covers to help you type more precisely.The screen is bright and excellent - one of the best screens I have used. The resolution isn't as crisp and nice as my Surface Book and Macbook, but definitely better than most.About that whole Alcantara-layered interior - yes it is beautiful, yes it feels great (no more cold palms in the winter). Just keep it clean (no eating potato chips while using it).Finally, the i5 and 8GB of RAM are good enough to avoid any hiccups in performance of your every usage of a normal laptop. This is not for gaming or video rendering, so if you are not expecting that, then this laptop's performance will not disappoint.The bottom line is you will buy this laptop for its looks, period. There is no value for this laptop - it is targeted as a premium-level laptop, not a value-level laptop. Any other normal laptop with these specs would be about $200 less. So you just have to ask yourself if the burgundy or slate blue color, and the style of design/craftsmanship are worth it for you.
Sexy, hot, fast, thin, solid, beautiful, functional and ready to go whenever and wherever. Not used to the heat though but keep the computer on a solid source..desk etc help to keep it Kool :)
Love it so far. I've only had it for about two weeks - but it works well. I'm pleased with the laptop - boots FAST - pretty easy setup. Light weight is nice and I purchased a docking station and hooked it up to my specialty keyboard and mouse. Added a 34" monitor and all works great so far!
On time, as promised, in a sealed manufacturer's box. Well done. The laptop is nice, although you need to do the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro in order to be able to run normal (non-app store) apps.
Allows me to wander about the house and keep up with email, investments, and searches. Very lightweight, no noisy fan, runs cool, looks cool, and has a great display.
It's a truly awesome laptop both in design and in performance. I love using it. Highly recommend this over its closest rival XPS 13. If only the screen could flip over so that Surface Pen could be used to full potential, the usability would have magnified. Nonetheless, I recommend it to everyone who want quality and performance.
After installing all of the updates and semi-configuring the laptop. I have an issue. The touchpad is terrible. It decides when it wants to allow you to right click or click anything. I don't always want to touch my screen to start an action. This is the WORST touchpad I've ever used on a laptop and I work in IT. My Huawei Matebook X touchpad responds when I decide to use it which is every time I'm using the computer. Changing the sensitivity doesn't help. I should never have to click on the touchpad more than once to bring up the right dialog menu or to launch a program. This is a disaster. I'm returning it.
Amazing feel and fast to operate. Definitely worth getting the i7 extra RAM. Only drawback would be the lack of ports. One usb and one display. Likely need a surface dock to be completely satisfied with this laptop. Other than that, amazing.
The worst laptop I have ever purchased: while functionally it is light and holds a charge, the Windows10S operating system is awful. From the get-go, simple things like attempting to download antivirus software (Norton) get repeatedly blocked by Windows Defender. If you decide you want to get Chrome, try again because it will redirect you to the Microsoft App store. Historically I have enjoyed using Windows, but this new PC and OS have all the overzealous proprietary turnoffs that I avoided Apple for. Do not buy this product.
Just started using it. I like it. Good ergonomics, well-laid out. Very happy.
This is the best laptop ive ever owned and im very picky. I highly recommend this laptop!
Handles all my needs, fast lightweight and plenty of battery power. Had the first version Andre turned it. They have done a great job
Exceeded my expectations! Not too big and not too small. It is perfect. I found a great case for it on amazon. Highly satisfied customer.
Amazing product - fast, light, great battery life. What's not to like?
Got this for my lady for Christmas. She loves it: easier to use than a laptop, and easier to carry around. It's fast, lightweight, and helps her organize her busy schedule.
Ideal netbook. Lightweight, fast and very portable.
Great laptop. Beautiful to look at. Light. As a business user, the keyboard travel is fantastic and the Alacantra skin makes it very comfortable to use. It's May 2018 and you can still upgrade free to Windows 10 Pro (thank heavens!). Very glad I did not buy another laptop.
Really enjoy this laptopâs blend of features: itâs beautifully designed without being fragile, the touchscreen is a useful option, and itâs quite thin and lightweight. Immediately used the free upgrade to Windows pro 10. No complaints!
I got this for Christmas and couldn't wait to set everything up! I did my research before buying this laptop so I knew what to expect. The set up was quick as usual and I got all my programs installed. Great laptop!
I really love this laptop so far. I have bad luck w/ technology so figures cross. But so far. No problem. I did upgrade to the Windows 10 instead of leaving it for 10s, which gave me more options to utilize. I recommend doing that! This laptop is smooth and fast!
Incredible disappointed. After 5 phone calls to Microsoft Support the keyboard still didnt work. One day wasted on a computer is ridiculous. The only reason for paying for the Microsoft bran is to avoid bad quality, like this.
I made a mistake when I ordered this. I meant to order the Surface Pro with detachable keyboard cover, and instead ordered the laptop. I have little experience with laptops, but this one seems satisfactory in all respects.
light and fast. looks great. screen is vivid and bright. battery is long. price is reasonable. very good buy
Great thin surface laptop. Great for its price. Say bye to macbooks.
Between the fabric lightness, speed, convenience. I love it all!!!!
This laptop is awesome! I am amazed at the ease of use, lightweight and speed! I am super happy with my choice.
Sleek machine, the fastest-booting computer I ever owned and good looking too. Downside is that there's just one usb slot and none for sd cards.
UPDATE: May 30, 2018: Do Not Buy This Laptop! The screen on mine broke for no apparent reason that I can think of. I did not drop the laptop, sit on the laptop, bend the laptop, hit the laptop on the edge of a desk or anything else that I am aware of. I handle this laptop with the utmost of care and this morning when I opened it I noticed some "streaks" on the screen that I attributed to cleaning with my microfiber cloth the previous day. But to my horror, it was not streaks but cracks in the screen. When I called the Microsoft Support Line, the first option was for broken screens. So do you think there is a problem with these Surface Laptops developing cracked screens? Duh. Well yeah. Unless you purchased the optional extended warranty, you are going to have to pay $450 for an out of warranty replacement. Sorry Microsoft, Not going to happen. You've lost a customer. UPDATE:July 3, 2017 - I visited a Microsoft Store today. I spent about an hour with a tech who ran the battery test again on my Surface Laptop. The results were basically the same as the results gotten when the Microsoft Support online tech ran the same test. The Surface Laptop battery has a design capacity of 45,200mWh but my battery has a full charge capacity of 48,500mWh. In other words, my battery has more capacity than the design capacity. That will diminish with time of course because Li-ion batteries lose capacity slowly over time. In fact the first time I ran the battery test my battery showed a full charge capacity of 50,000mWh so it has already lost some of that capacity just in the short time I've had the laptop.The most recent run of the Battery Test indicated an estimated battery life based on my usage pattern of 7:13:43 which is essentially what I mentioned I get in my review. The estimated battery life based on the design capacity of the battery is only 6:44:12. The tech basically admitted that the touted 14.5 hour video loop statistic that Microsoft touts is something that no one will get in real life usage. The takeaway is that there is nothing wrong with my battery or with my laptop. The laptop simply does not get anywhere near the advertised 14.5 runtime. So if you are expecting 11, 12 or 13 hours of runtime, you will be disappointed. As for the laptop magazines that run tests that indicate exaggerated runtimes, be very wary. Even Wired magazine agrees that 9-10 hours is a more realistic expectation although I've never gotten close to 10 hours.UPDATE: July 1, 2017 - My review states my overall impressions of the laptop. What I want to update is my great disappointment in the battery life. Microsoft is marketing this as having up to 14.5 hours of video playback (tested using Windows 10 Pro so you would assume that Windows 10s would have slightly better battery life.) The reality after using this for nearly 2 weeks is that I am only getting 7-7.5 hours of battery life. My use of the laptop is mostly word processing, email, Browsing Amazon, Spotify and occasional YouTube video streaming. I contacted Microsoft Technical Support and had a 1 hour chat session where the technician actually ran a screen sharing session on my laptop to check and change settings to help optimize battery life (such as turning off Hey Cortana setting.) He even ran a comprehensive battery usage report which indicated detailed battery use statistics for the previous 3 day period of time. What was gleaned from that was that my battery is discharging at an average rate of 12-15% per hour. Well, do the math. At that rate of discharge, there is no way you'll ever get 14.5 hours of battery life. I feel the whole 14.5 hour of battery life is a misleading metric that is only remotely possible under unlikely circumstances. I purchased this laptop primarily because of the touted long battery life. Now that I've had the Surface Laptop long enough I am able to conclude I will never see anywhere close to the 14.5 hours battery life claimed in the marketing hype. I am very disappointed, I routinely get no more than 7.5 hours of use before needing to recharge, and in some cases only 6.5 hours on a full charge. While I am very happy with the speed of the laptop and gorgeous design, the battery life is not at all meeting my expectations. That is why I am reducing my rating to 3 stars.---- This is a review of the Microsoft Surface Laptop (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB) - Platinum.I'm having a real love-hate relationship with this laptop. First let me give it some love...What a gorgeous laptop. It is thin, lightweight and has excellent build quality. There are no seams on the shell of this laptop. It looks like it was machined out of a solid hunk of aluminum. The laptop is rigid and does not flex. I can hold the front corner of the laptop and it feels totally solid in my hand.The display has touchscreen capabilities and has a 3 x 2 aspect ratio, like the good ol days. The touchscreen is very responsive with no perceptible lag. You can use a stylus with the touchscreen if you wish but the screen only goes back so far and can not be folded underneath the laptop as a would be able to do with a convertible laptop. Pixel density is 201ppi with the screen resolution of 2256 x 1504. That makes it great for working on documents and writing. But with a 3x2 aspect ratio, you may be bothered by the black bars that will be visible on the top and bottom areas of the screen. The display has gorilla glass to give it added strength. The display does have significant glare if used outside or light from windows or lights. I find that I sometimes have to choose my work position carefully to avoid glare. The screen is bright and sharp with excellent color.The only ports are a USB 3 port, a Mini Display Port and an audio output jack, all of those on the left side. The right side has the Surface Connect Docking & Power Port. The AC adapter is small and has a USB output for charging (it is not a data port.)I really like the Windows Hello face recognition feature for unlocking the laptop. It works quite well generally speaking but low light and strong backlighting can render it useless in which case you'll have to unlock the laptop using your PIN. Not a big deal.The trackpad is excellent. One of the best trackpads I've used. I also like the feel and look of the somewhat controversial Alcantara fabric that surrounds the keyboard and trackpad. It feels good when you rest your hand on it, but I do wonder whether in time oils from my skin will cause it to get shiny, collect dirt and who knows what. I'm on the fence about the Alcantara fabric.The laptop has plenty of cons. First and foremost is the fact that there is nothing upgradeable on this laptop. What you get is what you get. This concerns me greatly. It basically means you have a $1200 throwaway computer once the battery loses it's ability to hold a charge, a fate common to all Li-ion batteries. Unless Microsoft has some magical way that nobody knows about to open the laptop up and replace the battery this is a huge consideration. I'm also not happy that there is no SD Card slot. Since there is a USB 3 port, you can certainly use an external USB hard drive or external SSD drive but still, I'd like to have an SD card slot.The lack of USB-C is also something I don't understand. This is the future of USB and the lack of USB-C seems like a big omission to me.Now let me address my thoughts about the Windows 10s operating system. I'm really conflicted about this. Windows 10s limits your ability to download apps outside of the Store. Microsoft didn't even have Spotify in their Store until recently. I'm encouraged that more and more apps will be added to the Store but am dismayed that some apps that I used to use regularly on my other Windows laptop, iPad and Chromebook, like iTunes, Chrome Browser and YouTube are not available in the Store.Another peculiar obstacle is that you cannot change the default search engine (Bing) that the Microsoft Edge Browser uses. A workaround is to navigate to the search engine of your preference then save that page in a tab and access it from the tab bar when you want to use it.Otherwise there is not that much in Windows 10s that hobbles the laptop. If you want you can upgrade (and later downgrade back to 10s) to the Windows 10 Pro version and have the full windows experience. Also keep in mind that in theory 10s should give you slightly better battery life. The reason given to me by Microsoft Tech is that 10s eliminates certain background processes from occurring which would normally occur with Windows 10 Pro. I've not noticed a measurable difference in my use of the laptop, but I assume that it will depend on what you've installed and how you use your Surface Laptop.Battery life for me is nowhere near the claimed 13.5 hours. Not even close. My previous Windows laptop got only about 3.5 hours so what I'm getting from the Surface Laptop exceeds that greatly. But still, it's not even close to 13.5 hours. On a good day I can eek out maybe 7.5 hours of use before I need to plug into power.UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 10 PRO: After a lengthy debate with myself I took the plunge and upgraded to 10 Pro. It took only 2 minutes. What prompted me to upgrade was another dumbed down feature of 10s that I simply could not live with. 10s does not allow you to access the Command Line. So you are not able to even run the battery test function unless you upgrade to 10 Pro. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Now that I have 10 Pro installed I will be able to definitively report back in a week or so whether it has degraded, improved or has no influence on my battery life.I found an awesome sleeve that I could recommend. It is the Lacdo 11-12" sleeve and is quite nice, well padded and fits the Surface Laptop absolutely perfectly.Â Lacdo 11-12 Inch Water Repellent Laptop Sleeve Case for MacBook Air 11.6" New Macbook 12" Surface Pro 4 3 Asus Dell HP Ultrabook Notebook Bag, Black
I know most people cringe when thinking about Microsoft hardware. There have been some massive failures over the years. Remember around the time of the first iphone, the Windows Phones on AT&T? What a mess. Remember trying to update them? The Surface line of tablets have actually been pretty good, but in the end most people either just want a really good tablet or a good laptop. The surface laptops have filled a nice need which is a speedy laptop that is super slim and can act like a tablet as well. As long as you get the model with at least a core i5, 8 gigs of RAM and 256 SSD, the surface laptop performs great. You can hold it with 2 or 3 fingers and fits in a tablet sleeve. I have one of these myself and we have sold about 20 of them for our employees and clients and have had very few issues so far. The finish on the laptop looks nice, but it can show some fingerprints or new to be wiped off after a lot of use. The reason I am taking off a star is because of the confusion and frustration of having these laptops ship with Windows 10 S. I won't bore you with what Windows 10 S is, suffice to say that it is a stripped down version meant for large rollouts and not suitable for most people. It's true that you can switch to Windows 10 Pro for free, but it's super confusing for people that don't know how or why they need to do that. Overall while not perfect, for the price the surface laptop is a great choice.
This really is an excellent product from Microsoft, proud owner of this machine since August 2017, never lets me down, incredible battery lifetime, totally silent and really thin! I've owned loads of laptops and this one tops them all. I also own the latest Microsoft Surface Pro (not the laptop) because I couldn't decide between these beasts. I really like them both, a really good hardware and overall goods products by Microsoft. They hit the sweet spot with these machines. Highly recommended!
Been debating for so long whether I should get this big ticket item and I have not regretted it a single time!
best choose in my life I love you Mr Bill
Wonderful laptop
Fast and light, but donât buy if you expect the touch screen to work all the time. It stopped working a few months in no matter how much troubleshooting I do it will only work for like 5 seconds after restart. Get used to using a mouse and buy a usb hub.
Excellent unit
Upgraded to the windows 10pro. Loved the laptop, good display, light, fast, perfect to bring around for work use.
Great product and great turnaround time.
It's been two days now using my new surface laptop and I have to admit it, it is a very nice laptop. It was shipped in time and I got what I expected. I recommend this seller.
Did not expect this level of performance and quality. One word i can think of to describe this item is âsleekâ?
Amazing laptop, no issues with it so far.
Great Notebook. Very happy with it.
Very nice product!
Occasional blue screens
nice experience
Best computer I've ever owned.
Super slick. Lightweight. Very stylish.
By far the best laptop I've ever had the pleasure of using. speed, weight and power are perfect.
I think the screen is easy to leave the fingerprint.
The device is great but there is a problem with the touchpad
My wife loves it! Using it 8 hours a day and not one problem. Super fast and the display is as sharp as our ipad retina display
Excellent ProductThanks
Great Product
looks great and is very fast for what i need it to do.
Love it.
Very Satasified!
Great computer. I got it for work and it is so nice. Good battery life, very light and easy to take places, good quality.
I Love this Surface Laptop but I only use it in tablet mode. I'm sure there are lots of things it does but I mostly use it to read news and surf the web.As I get more comfortable with it I'll find other uses for it. I highly recommend Microsoft Surface Laptop/Tablet.
Overall it's a very nice laptop -- light, thin, with a very nice screen and a great keyboard. I'll just mention one downside: the i7 version gets HOT, uncomfortably hot to leave it on your lap (especially if you're wearing shorts!). I'll look for an option to slow the processor while I'm running it on battery, which might reduce the heat a bit without killing performance. All thin laptops have this issue, but just wanted to point it out.
First one I received fully crashed within 4 months, Microsoft has the worst customer service I've ever dealt with. Amazon was great to deal with and sent a replacement, love the computer when its working, hopefully the second one lasts longer than 4 months
To start off, I was supposed to get a $200 gift card for the purchase of this item, which I didn't, and Amazon would not work with me regarding the promotion (which is the only reason I considered buying this laptop). I will not judge the actual item based on my poor experience with Amazon.This laptop is great. I took naturally to the touchscreen, but you can function on the laptop without the touchscreen (I realize some people do not like to "ruin" the screen). Some things may bother you though.NO CD ROM. I lucked out in that I could download all the previous apps I had, but if you require a CD, you will need to buy an external CD ROM drive to run the apps, and to burn CD's.ONLY 1 USB PORT. So I had to buy a splitter. Personally bought it to be able to use a mouse and keyboard, although I find it comfortable typing on the laptop's keyboard.Overall, I've had it for over a month and I love it. No major problems, very fast so long has you have a decent internet condition. I have a lot of apps and files that I transferred with no problem and the computer is still running great.
First off, let me share my wife's testimony, "This is the laptop of my dreams." She's the one using it most these days, and has had a few clunkers over the years, so is thrilled by how well this works. I use it on occasion too, and I'm also the one who set it up, and deals with tech issues in our house. First, the two (literally just these two) complaints: the vent near the bottom back can get pretty hot if it's on your lap and if it's on your lap and you open it up, the screen might pinch your thighs. Other than those, this is really flawless for its purpose. Some have critiqued it for not allowing upgrades or personal fixing, which I get as I've repaired more than a few laptop hardware issues. But, very few people have an interest or capability for doing that, and the tradeoff is how thin and light this is.It's not a gaming laptop, it's a productivity laptop and for that, it's wonderful. My personal main laptop is aÂ Dell XPS9350-10673SLV 13.3" 3200x1800 Laptop (Intel Core i7-6560U 2.2GHz Processor, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SDD, Windows 10 Microsoft Signature Image) Silver, and that's what I'm comparing this Surface laptop to. I have pictures which show the relative size. The Surface is more square, providing a larger overall screen, it's also thinner and lighter, not surprising given that it doesn't have near the same specs as the Dell. That said, my Dell is mostly overkill as I tend to keep the resolution on it from max because it's too much for too small of a space for most things (except watching movies) and it has a mediocre battery. The Surface keeps up with almost every task, and if it can't match the Dell 13 on heavy demands, that's not a problem most of the time. The reality of the Surface is that it works, it worked great out of the box, with easy set-up, and continues to be an entirely problem free experience. I would echo the recommendation of others to do the free upgrade from the Windows 10S that this comes with to get it to the regular Windows 10. A few minutes of extra setup time can save some bother and allow more freedom later on. Painless to do, as was the whole process. My wife uses this for browsing, netflix, and also her work-from-home job of captioning, which requires good video and audio. The audio on this is strong and the video is spectactular. The touch screen works fluidly as does the touchpad. This laptop allows us to use it for what we need it for, in ways that are much more user-friendly than anything else I've used. I still personally prefer my Dell 13 for its larger hard drive and more memory. I also like the Dell for having a USB-C, and am surprised Microsoft decided against that. Battery life is really strong, going all day really. This is a perfect work or school laptop, really allowing to maximize productivity without sacrificing anything. It's not the best for hardcore gaming, but that's not it's purpose. If you need a capable, trustworthy, easy to use laptop, this is a very good choice.
Definitely received a used Surface Laptop. Box had been opened and the laptop was dirty from use. Doesn't seem to have any scratches and seems to work fine. It would be beneficial to list this as a used item or a refurbished item in the description.
Love this laptop. Very thin and lightweight and the system works very fast. I would purchase this brand again in the near future.
EDIT 12/02/17-- I have returned this item to purchase the next model up (i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and a 256 GB SSD). While the base model was fast and was fine with my normal tasks, I couldn't get over the 4GB of ram at this price range. I returned the laptop because I'm afraid that a few years down the road, this won't be enough memory to last. I purchased the next model up from microsoft's website as it was on sale. For an extra $200 I get the better, mid-tier, model and peace-of-mind with the 8GB of RAM and the bigger hard drive. I highly recommend that if you're going to spend this much money, save up a little more and get the mid-level surface laptop.To preface, I bought this computer at my local best buy for $900, and it came with a microsoft Arc bluetooth mouse (it's awesome). I purchased the base model with an i5 processor, 4 gb of RAM, and a 128 gb SSD. I bought this laptop because the look of the computer really struck me. As for the internals, at $900 you could probably get a better laptop. The processor so far appears to be good, and the SSD is blazing fast.The only thing that concerns me, is the 4 GB of RAM. Only having chrome open, with two chrome tabs the memory is already at 50% usage in task manager. I didn't buy this laptop to be a work house and do crazy video editing or gaming, I bought this to do simple things like browse the internet.The screen is insanely clear, I compared this to my macbook pro retina early 2015 and I actually prefer this screen over my mac. The keyboard is nice to type on, and the audio/sound of the laptop is more than adequate. The laptop itself is very light and easy to move, it reminds me of a macbook air.I'd say that, if you are considering this laptop, do your research and know what you're getting into. It's an expensive computer, but it looks DAMN good. If you only plan to use this laptop to use chrome and do other basic tasks, I would recommend the base model.P.S. None of these computers have scalabilty. Meaning you can't purchase more RAM or a bigger hard drive and install it.
I love it, so far! Quite easy to convert to Office 10 Pro if you already have it on another machine. Thanks Microsoft! Thanks to a quick internet search, I didn't even have to call my brother-in-law to help!
Exceptional laptop. Very light weight, fast and just works great.
just as advertised
So far, one of the most beautiful computing devices I have owned so far. That's a real statement considering I have owned more than 15 laptops in the past decade.The screen is a stunner, touchpad and keyboard are simply fantastic and the sound is surprisingly loud and clear. The ports leave a lot to be desired but isn't a deal breaker. Although I have yet to confirm true daily performance and battery life, so far it has been overwhelmingly positive. I only felt this when I had ordered the Dell XPS ultrathin but was quickly reminded of its deal breaking limitations.You'll want to show this off and will equally enjoy using it as your daily driver. Definitely remember to use the free upgrade to Windows 10 pro until the S version has a store that is well populated with the most critical windows apps for power users and general users alike.
Disappointed to find that this product was used, box had been open and it had scuff marks on it. Understand that itâs a good price but it doesnât say anything in the description about the item being a return or used. BUYER BEWARE
workhorse little laptop
Guys this computer died on me 3 months after I bought it and is no longer eligible to be returned or have free product support. For real????? I guess I'll take it in to a Microsoft store and see if they can do any better for me. A HUGE DRAG.
Love the laptop, it looks great!
The color on the device is fading. Need to return to the manufacture for a replacement.
Gift, he loves it
Great laptop. Even though it's only got one usb. It blew my LENOVO out of the water with the features and software included. Great stylish machine.
Love this laptop.I had a Surface Pro, but hated it due to the small screen size, small battery, and substandard keyboard. This laptop takes all the best features of the Surface Pro and adds to it. Sleek and slim form factor. Spectacular screen. Good battery life. The only slight knock is a lack of ports, but this isn't an important factor for me.
Great little laptop, nice screen resolution and fast processor. My only issue is it only has one USB plug and no SD card slot
****UPDATE AFTER 5 MONTHS OF USE****I still really like this laptop, but a few issues have arisen that I wanted to mention. First, the laptop shuts off at 6% battery, not when it gets down to 0%, and then once it shuts off, I have to wait about 2-3 minutes after plugging it in for it to boot up. So that's really annoying, especially if I'm in the middle of something. Also, inexplicably, the brightness keys stopped working. These are not huge issues, but little annoyances on a laptop that's still quite new.*****Original Review Follows****I have been using this laptop for about a month now and I absolutely LOVE it. Itâs my first Windows laptop in a long time---Iâve been using Macs for quite a while---and this is really fantastic and feels like a big upgrade over my Macbook Pro.There are so many things I love about it, so Iâm just going to go through them. The battery life is excellent. Itâs very thin and light and sleek; basically itâs visually beautiful. I adore the touchscreen---I thought it was going to be kind of gimmicky but itâs super responsive and a nice feature. The speakers are amazing, and thatâs probably where I see the most notable difference between this computer and my Macbook---the speakers and sound is just ridiculously good. Oh, and the facial recognition for login is a neat feature.The ports are decent; I personally find the lack of an HDMI port a little annoying but that might not be an issue for most people. Thatâs actually the only real negative for me, so if thatâs not an issue for you, you might not have any negatives.I have to admit that having used a Mac for so long, I was a little worried about how I would find the Windows OS, but I found it really easy to pick up, and in just a few weeks I feel totally used to it. This computer is fast, responsive, and instinctive.I absolutely love this laptop and have no regrets for giving up my Macbook for it. Love, love, love it.
I've been a devoted Windows user since the early 90s. In parallel, and in counterpoint, I've also cycled through countless Windows laptops over the years, including Compaq, HP and Dell, and often been disappointed with the longevity of the machines. I nevertheless retained my affinity for the Windows operating system---so much so that when I purchased a MacBook Pro last year, I partitioned the disk and continued operating under Windows 10. I therefore greeted news of the Surface Laptop this spring---with its sleek and unitary design, and integration with other Microsoft products---with great enthusiasm. At last, I thought, the hardware would rise to the level of the software. The Surface Laptop would be Microsoft's answer to Apple.Alas, upon buying the machine (indeed, the highest-end model), I found myself severely disappointed.First of all, it ran noisy and hot right out of the box. Second, I could not even obtain a full-screen display on a standard Samsung external monitor (a defect which could not be resolved through a lengthy call to Microsoft Tech Support). How could Microsoft overlook such a basic requirement?After several hours of struggling I put the machine back in the box and returned it for a full refund. From Microsoft, I expected much better.
BitLocker recovery error on the very first boot. Had to return it.
I purchased this computer a little over a month ago and I absolutely loved it. But then a week ago I turn it on and the screen doesn't show a picture. The Microsoft icon comes on and then nothing. The keyboard still lights up but the screen is completely blank. I have my personal information on it so I can't even send it in under the warranty unless I want that information to be exposed potentially. Very upset at the quality of this product.
My 48 hours review of the New Microsoft Surface Laptop with my Pros and Cons...I originally planned on ordering my PC from Amazon but I ended up placing my order directly through the Microsoft Store and doing an in-store pick up. I was able to receive a 10% student discount so it made the price lower than anywhere else.I went with the Graphite Gold i5, 8gb, 256 - this configuration meets all of my needs since I don't do any gaming or do I run any heavy programs. My use will be web browsing, school and business use with Office 365, some light photoshop or camtasia every now and again, and streaming video so this compute meets all of my needs. I upgraded it to 10 Pro right out of the box since I don't want to be limited to Windows Store Apps only.The Alcantara wrapping is OK, I can see it getting very dirty and showing wear and aging at the 6 month mark, Microsoft says to just keep it clean by regularly wiping it downs using a damp lint free cloth. I personally will have this laptop connected to a docking station while at home and use a wireless keyboard and mouse along with a bigger monitor connected via hdmi from the mini display port so I am not that concern with it the Alcantara getting dirty and faded. I will only type on it directly when I am at school and I usually take hand written notes on legal pads so I'll make sure to keep it clean. Also with the Microsoft Complete for Surface Laptop you can get 2 yrs of coverage from damage and issues.Pros ++ The touch screen is excellent! The touch screen is really great and has works flawlessly so far.+ The screen and the resolution is excellent, the picture quality and brightness is the best of any computer I have owned and it should be as this has the highest resolution screen.+ The built quality feels premium and heavy with the aluminum casing.+ The Windows Hello Facial Recognition was a big selling point for me, it works great and you will have hands free sign-in.+ The speeds seems faster than the 15" laptop I replaced which also had an i5 from an early generation at 3.2. That PC is still working perfectly I just wanted a new laptop.+ The keyboard is nice with 4 adjustable black light settings (off, low, med, high) and feel while typing is so quality and smooth.Cons -- The color could have been more vibrant with a bit more pop, I think I would have like the cobalt blue color better. But it is still a nice color.- The touch track pad sucks! Maybe I have to make some adjustments to it but so far it's too sensitive and responsive doing other things on its own I did not want.- Cost, it's a bit on the higher end. It is a premium product without a doubt so I guess you have to pay a little extra for that Microsoft quality. It's the same price as the 13" Macbook Pro which I considered but ruled out because I prefer Windows.Another beautiful option to consider and the one I had to think about for a few weeks is the new HP SPECTER x360. That is a gorgeous computer with higher specifications for the same price. You can get a i7 a better graphics card and the same premium look and feel of quality with an aluminum body. The main reasons I decided on the Surface Laptop was the Windows Hello Face Recognition.
The fact that this product was Microsoft 10S was the reason I declined to keep it. I would have preferred Microsoft Home or business.
Slim, light, easy to navigate
For incorrect description. Office does not come with 1 year subscription.
nice laptop
Beautifuly crafted product.
I ordered my model from Best Buy, as I will start university and wanted a reliable, convenient, and dependable laptop for college years.And I love this thing, it's light, powerful, and with the large update and upgrade to Windows 10 Pro I haven't had a problem with this computer. I purchased the Surface Dock for this which truly transforms it to a desktop computer you can rely on, so this will come in handy when I come to work at home and could use the extra ports and power.The battery is great however the 14 hours part is misleading! After lightly browsing Fire Fox, upgrading to Windows 10 Pro, and setting the option to best battery life, low brightness, etc. The battery only lasted about 5 hours before getting to 30%. I notice depending on what you are doing, battery performance will vary greatly, form streaming, running programs, having multiple browsers up, etc. But the battery still is great.This laptop has an excellent design, this is by far the best touch screen I've used on any computer, which will come handy if I ever need to draw quick notes in the future.CONS:-Other colors not available for the more powerful models-Screen wobbles when you touch the screen, so if that will bother you look to getting the Surface Pro-Price. It's rather common sense to not get 4 GB in 2017 if you're spending 1000+ on a laptop, so be prepared to cough up a to of cash for this. I myself spent 1500+ dollars at Best Buy with a 10% discount... I am not rich, I had to save money all summer, but it was worth it.-You won't be able to upgrade parts on this laptop or do home repairs, so MAKE SURE you get the specs that will last through four years (I assume most getting this laptop are fellow college students such as myself) and consider you may one day have to send this in for repairs. However the superior build quality makes me feel comfortable that the only way this could break is if it were my fault or I was really unlucky/careless.-No USB-C-Mini-USB, but no HDMI or USB-c...? Really Microsoft? I've always loved and used your products but come on. If you're gonna make us use all the extra dongles, at least include them!-One USB slot, NO memory card slots!Other than that, make sure to watch reviews from various trusted YouTube Channels such as from Dave Lee and Linus Tech Tips to make sure this is the Laptop you need and want!
What can I say? From the leather like feel of the palm rest, to the amazingly vibrant screen, to the crazy battery life, this is one darn good machine. Battery Life - I work in Word, Excel, Outlook and OneNote all day long, and using those programs (with Wi-Fi & Bluetooth on, Display at recommended, and power at recommended) I am receiving 16-18 hours of battery life. When I browse the internet in my free time I get closer to 12-14 hours, so high internet usage will drain your battery faster, but still, those are some amazing numbers.Display - Bright, vibrant colors. I have never had a problem reading anything, even outdoors.Keyboard and trackpad - there is a tiny bit of keyboard flex, but the keys are fine, and the trackpad is wow. The same glass trackpad as the Surface Book (read amazing)OS - I have yet to require an app outside of the Windows Store, but if you do, grab your free update to Windows 10 Pro.Graphics - can do basic gaming, but no powerhouse.Overall - great machine
Best laptop for looks and performance. The fan is only noticeable when I put my ear up to it, even while living in Phoenix! It feels amazing to carry, especially for a student.The battery life is the best I've seen. WAY better than my Surface Pro 3. By the time I open the lid all the way, Windows Hello has already recognized me and logged me in with no wait time at all. The laptop is lightweight, and performs snappier than my Surface Pro 3 i7. The screen looks amazing, and the touch is incredible especially for how slim the screen is. The keyboard is surrounded by amazing fabric that is light on your wrists while typing (no it doesn't stink and hasn't changed colors) and the keys with 1.5 mm travel feel like a premium keyboard. I have loved this laptop for the week of using it for my junior year in college. Great purchase and well done Microsoft.
This is a Microsoft laptop. The description says it comes with Windows and Office, two Microsoft Products. One would think that it is just a 30-day trial subscription. And, they want you on Windows 365 and Office 2016--the latest Microsoft items. As a consultant, I need a computere that is on the same platform as my client. Microsoft Customer Service tried to figure out how I could get Office 2010 versus 2016....regardless, when we were close to thinking we might be successful, I asked the representative to stay on the line to make sure it worked. They hung up. It didn't work. Relied on my former IT husband to Google his way around the issues. It is not a great sync with my dear beloved Mac. I've been using HPs/Compacts in the last three jobs. My parents have issues all the time with their Surface, I blamed it on old age. They blame it on frequent updates and having to resolve issues because of the updates. Go figure.
This little laptop is amazing. I received it at the same time I bought a Dell Ultrabook, and it will replace my wife's Lenovo laptop that is dying. Externally the laptop has a minimalist styling, lots of aluminum with a tasteful Microsoft logo. It's a little heavier than my ultrabook, which makes sense as the ultrabook is all plastic, and no touch screen. The screen on the Surface is sharp and beautiful. Setup only took a few minutes. I was disappointed when I tried to install Chrome though, and the the pre-installed OS wouldn't allow it. Luckily it did prompt me to switch to regular Windows 10, which I did. Since then I was able to install my normal software suite. The machine is incredibly fast and quiet. It doesn't heat up the way our old Lenovo did. The camera is very high quality as well, my wife's relatives have all commented that her video quality has improved alot. I really like having the touch screen, as I use a tablet daily. I found myself toughing other laptop screens out of habit, with nothing happening...My wife and I are very happy with this high quality laptop, it's a great upgrade to our older equipment.
when I get it, and update my system, then it has no response any more, the screen and keyboard still have brightness, could anybody told me what happenedï¼ï¼ï¼ï¼
TODAY, IT IS 2/22/18 AND I HAVE HAD THIS LAPTOP SINCE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER 2017, AND IT WORKED LAST NIGHT, AND THIS MORNING IT IS DEAD. WTF? what do I do now???
I switched from Windows to Mac about 5 years ago. I swore I would never go back. I've been gotten increasingly annoyed with being in the iOS/Mac operating systems. About twice a month, I get prompted to change my iCloud password on my iPhone and then when I change it and go to use my MacBook Pro, I get flooded with "login keychain" error messages that I can't make go away. And then constant reminders to change my passwords even though I already have. In one of these frustrating moments, I happened to wander into a Microsoft store and landed in front of the new Surface laptop. I was pretty blown away. Great looking machine; very comfortable to use, and FAST. After hemming and hawing, I bought one - the basic $799 i5 model w/ 4 GB RAM and 128 SSD. I am beyond thrilled. I immediately downloaded the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. I have never experienced such a smooth, effortless, fast computing experience. This thing is great. They got this one right. Now going back to my MacBook seems like a downgrade!
My favorite laptop in years. Love the facial recognition login, and love the feel of the fabric. Looks sleek, i7 feels like it was worth it. Software dev is no problem with this laptop - I have a web server, sql server, etc... all going at once, no problem.
I am going to preface this with the statement that I am not a tech nerd or even remotely tech knowledgeable. I can only really comment on the laptop as I see it and how it performs for me. Please feel free to look at other reviewers if you want more technical information. The outward appearance is absolutely stunning. The casing has a solid sturdy feel that is a major improvement from the plastic cased laptops I've had over the years. It is very sleek and the lack of screws and venting make for smooth, uninterrupted lines. There is fabric on the deck and I have to say that it's one of the best highlights of the machine. Normally I end up with sweaty or sticky palms/wrists when typing for an extended period of time, but not anymore. The laptop also generates far less heat than any I have ever used before. I don't have to put it on top of a pillow when I'm sitting on the couch and it seems to stay pretty cool to the touch. The keypad and track pad are total stunners on this machine. Both seem almost perfect in their response and tactile feeling. I like the back-lighting adjustment feature for the keypad so that I can conserve battery power when using it at night. I am also impressed with the speakers and how they are located under the keyboard, keeping the deck looking sleek and slimmed down. They do put out very good sound for laptop speakers too. I have noticed people complaining about the lack of USB-C ports.......I don't really know what that is. This machine has enough for what I need to use, and I am assuming for general day to day use it will suit people just fine. The speed and performance are also on the higher end of what I am used to for general computing/word processing and other type of functions. I have a TV and a tablet already, so I am not using this for gaming or movie watching. I think that for most people who want a computer for general day to day use, this will be perfect fit. The last bit is about the OS. I have to agree with other reviewers on this portion.....it's not very useful at all. It is really the only negative thing I have to say about this laptop, and it's easily remedied anyway. Overall, if you are looking to upgrade to something that's high end, without dealing with too high of a price or more machine than you actually need, this Surface has it all. I feel like I get the aesthetics of a Mac with the familiarity and ease of use in a PC.
This computer is very comparable to the MacBook. There are a few features that we saw as it's best.-Very light and slim, makes for easy carry.-Speakers- They work very well, especially compared to the MacBook's quiet speakers.-Touch Screen is very easy to work and manage.-The key board has a nice surface and makes it easy for typing and resting hands on.-The charger cord doesn't seem to cause any fraying at the computer connection.-At this point, it runs up fast and smooth.-The APP options makes it super easy to jump to your favorite show, check email and other items.The negatives of this computer are the following:-There are no Hard/Protecting Cases made for it yet, which could be a problem especially for my household size.-The charging cord is pretty short. (I did not review to see if a longer size was available.)-The battery seems to be a good battery, however when the computer is not on battery save mode, it tends to die quick.-While on Battery save mode, the screen seems to be darker than what would be requested of our norm. (This could be a personal preference.)Overall, I highly recommend this computer. We are a MAC family and tend to steer away from other products. This computer again seems to be the closest Microsoft computer that we have touched that can compete with MacBook. We will be curious to see how long it's life lasts.
This beautiful laptop came with a nasty surprise. Sometimes it get super hot down the keyboard and feels as if it gonna explode. Really scared of using it while hot and always have to stop my work and shut down the machine. A little search on google reveals that a lot of people are complaining about this problem and Microsoft is unable to find and fix this bug. A laptop with such an extreme heat-up issue usually has unfortunately short life span.
For my purposes, this is the best Windows laptop under $1,500 right now. I bought this laptop about three months ago and it has been my regular machine for work. I am absolutely not going back to the old work laptop (HP 820 G3) and don't think I'd take the other Surface offerings.Things I adore:The 3:2, high-resolution touchscreen is hands down the best screen for getting things done on the go. This blows the prison issue HP Elitebook 820 G3's 16:9 screen out of the water, and, to my untrained eye, is as bright and precise as my 2017 Macbook Pro (used for home use - I like separation of church and state). The 3:2 aspect ratio is magical for the usual trio of Outlook, Excel, and Word.Things I like:In terms of form factor - this reminds me a lot of an older Macbook Air. It's just about the right size, and is featherweight. I'm satisfied with battery life, speakers, and performance. Docking (with one exception, mentioned below in the "things I hate" section) is easy and works every time.Things I don't like:The keyboard (lots of pressure necessary to type - much prefer a ThinkPad up to and including T420 keyboard), and general surroundings in alcantara. One of my cars has an alcantara headliner and pillars - which is great because I never touch them. The gray alcantara is begging to get dirty and I think I'm already seeing a bit of a shadow where my right palm rests.Would love a second USB type A port, and would love to have a Windows laptop that doesn't have coil whine. There's a hint of it if the room's silent - nothing like the Dell XPS 13 tried out and ended up returning last year.Things I hate:I'm forced to run a custom Windows 10 Enterprise image and I have scaling problems. My two external monitors are connected via a Surface Dock - two Planar specials at 1440p. I run the laptop at 125% scaling, and the monitors at 100%. No matter which Surface display/dock/whatever driver update I perform, I still have issues upon docking and undocking, that requires me to log out and log back in.
The real grabber is the 13.5-inch screen resolution of 2256 X 1504;it catches yur attenion and won't let go. Your eyes will be attractedto it as if there was a magnetic pull.Then we proceed to a possible deal-breaker, the operating system.Win10S (S for Student) has security upgrades, but sprouted warts;you are limited to software packages available from MicroSoftApp store only. The corporate honchos believe this restriction willmaintain security, and to an extent, they may be correct.You will discover that Chrome will not run, while MS Edge will.Thus, you must make adjustments to Win10S; it will not accomodateall your wishes.Upgrade to Win10 Pro is an option for an additional $50, although it ispresently a free option. The Surface pen is a $99.99 extra-costaddition that was once included in earlier Surface versions. Strangely,Adobe apps can't run in Surface, so your creativity might be stuntedby this restriction.Sound reproduction is excellent, a real surprise considering Surface'sultra-thin case. Audio is really enhanced when the Surface resides ona wooden table.Another plus is the striking cosmetics of Surface - gorgeous. TheAlcantara fabric on the console is a matter of personal taste; it mightenhance your experience; it certainly won't detract from it.Surface is ideal as a portable, take anywhere laptop with functionalityof a tablet. Typical battery life is 8 hours. Wireless connectivity isautomatic, hassle-free.You are limited to a single USB3.0 port, though, which you may appreciateif you travel light. Touchpad performance has really improved the pastdecade. Tracking is precise, and clicks are positivem and no more wanderingcursors.Will Win10S become the academic operating system of choice? Theanswer is entirely dependent on cost. The Surface will set you backapproximately $1200. I cannot imagine too many school districtsbacking programs forcing parents to pony-up that much for a laptop-tablet hybrid, especially with an operating system that cannot runmany user apps. Students won't appreciate that encroachment ontheir liberties.Bottom line: Win10S has superior security features, but uers candownload and run only MicroSoft App store distros. The Surfaceplatform is a joy to admire and handle; you will likely take iteverywhere. Its cosmetics, audio, and graphics resolution arestunners.I believe MicroSoft has almost upstaged the industry, includingApple, with new generation Surface.
I got this as a gift for taking an expensive class. It looks like the replacement for last year's entry model for the i5, 4gb/128gb memory. Based on the reviews from last year's model, this notebook has improved with 8gb memory and has an Intel 7300u cpu. While the cpu upgrade is welcomed, I wish it has the 8th gen 4 core/8 thread coffee lake cpu instead. It looks like it has the same toshiba 128gb ssd as last year. I didn't run any benchmarks, but it is zippy enough. The laptop also comes with Windows 10 Pro instead of the Windows 10 S.This notebook is definitely premium looking with its aluminum chassis and the keyboard is very comfortable to type. This notebook is quiet most of the time but makes a funny but not loud noise when the fan is in full throttle. 2 major gripes of this notebook is the lack of expanandability as this notebook has 1 usb port, no sd card slot and you can forget about servicing this notebook as this notebook is not meant to be taken apart. So you can't even replace the battery without potentially damaging the notebook.
I just bought the Surface laptop in Cobalt, I wanted the Burgundy but it was out of stock. I am a 60 year old professional who is not technologically sophisticated. I have a 17" HP laptop at home that I love, but I desperately needed something light and easy to use. I travel quite a bit and I wanted to bring my laptop to work to take notes. My 17" HP was too heavy. I tried out the Surface Pro and it is adorable but screen is too small. The HP two in ones were great and I actually bought one but turned out to be too heavy for regular back and forth to office so I returned it for this laptop. This laptop is just right, very light but I can work with the screen size just fine. I absolutely love the touch screen, and the material the keyboard is made from. It's really comfortable. The touchpad with cursor is very easy to use, though I still prefer a mouse. I'll get the pen soon.The Windows 10S that it comes with is annoying but the upgrade to regular Windows wasn't too difficult. The number of USB ports is small for all the things I like to attach, but no worries, I simply bought a USB attachment in Best Buy that has 4 ports in it for my mouse, printer, and flashdrives. I got a year subscription for Word, Excel, and Power Point but this suite does not come with Outlook which is separate. Best Buy transferred all my documents easily, but transferring everything I had saved in Outlook was quite difficult and time consuming, and it wasn't perfect but it is up and running now. I am still practicing using the new Outlook. All in all, I just love the size and weight of this laptop!.
The i5 with 8gb of RAM isn't sufficient for engineers, artists, and other heavy users, but it's probably perfect for managers and others who only do email and documents. Obviously upgrade to Windows 10 Pro (I think "S" stands for "Sham"), but the process was painful for me, requiring two MS support sessions, but they eventually figured it out.It uses the Surface base station which works extremely well, better than even Apple's offering. I have it plugged into a 2256x1504 res monitor and it can handle the extra pixels just fine. The Laptop's own display is extremely sharp and gorgeous, although some apps don't yet support high density displays, but overall it's nice. The fabric feels really good, and my palms never stick to it like what usually happens with metal laptops when it heats up. The keyboard has a great feel, but that's subjective. The touchpad isn't as good as a Macbook's, but is decent enough. The touchscreen and pen support are wonderful, even though the pen lags (it isn't for artists, otherwise gets the job done well enough).Doesn't get a full 5 because the lid is difficult to open (the magnet/hinge is too string, probably so it won't shake much when touching the screen), and Windows 10 is still very buggy. I don't like including Windows in the review, but fact is, it's a part of the laptop, so here we are.
Many thanks for you rapid shipment of this wonderful item.
This is an incredible product. I owned a mac for 6 years before this and it has totally superseded the mac. I was looking for an affordable touch screen labtop that was bigger than mac's 12 inch screen. The screen is clear and vivid, the touch screen works incredibly well. The bundle deal was such an attractive offer to get one price and have it all included. It even came with a kate spade case and a mouse that is so easy to bring around when you flatten it. I got a student discount as well. It's light, durable, and the best purchase I've ever made. better than apple, so happy with it! BUY IT!
If you're looking for a Macbook alternative, the Surface line is the go to option. This laptop has incredible build quality and feels like a tank. The hinge is perfectly tuned so you can open it with one hand, but still stiff enough to not wobble when using the touchscreen.Even though it's using last years 7th generation processor, in 2018, this is still a fine laptop. It handles most everything I can throw at it with ease, only slowing down with numerous apps open and >20 chrome tabs.If you get the machine with Windows 10 S, upgrade to Pro right away. It's free.Screen quality is top notch. Colors are vibrant, and it's bright enough to see outdoors. It also gets dim enough to use at night in bed, which not all laptops can do. The keyboard is excellent, much much better than the atrocity that is the 2016+ Macbook's. Battery life is excellent as well, ranging between 7-10 hours depending on what I'm doing.All in all, a great laptop. It's pricey, but you get what you pay for.
I wanted a sleek clamshell laptop in aluminum for while because all the kids on campus have them, but have always used Windows, so I was excited to see this come out. I bought it for productivity (word processing, creating slides for classes, programming, photo editing and light graphics design) and it has proved a fun machine to use because of the portability and good looks. I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro so I could use legacy software. The laptop has enough processing power for anything I've used it for and is nice and light. The keyboard is comfortable, the trackpad is smooth and accurate and the battery life is enough to get through most of the day with the performance and screen brightness jacked up.The screen is excellent and the build is solid. The fabric on the keyboard is holding up after four months' use and feels good.I'd be happy if they made the laptop a bit thicker put a bigger battery in it and upped the storage, but I feel that way about all my electronics. My only other minor gripe is that there is a lip at the front of the keyboard that doesn't seem to have a purpose (maybe to help opening the lid), and would be more comfortable if rounded. I had no intention of gaming on this, but as a surprise bonus, it streams my Xbox nicely.I used this successfully to expand the single USB 3.0 port to three and add Ethernet:Anker 3-Port USB-C to USB 3.0 Aluminum Portable Data Hub, with 10 Mpbs, 100 Mbps, 1000 Mbps, or 1 Gigabit Network Adapter with Ethernet Port, for MacBook Pro 2016, ChromeBook, XPS and More
I bought this laptop for my son who is a college student. It worked fine for 2 months, then he encountered an issue with the screen going black. He has to connect to another monitor in order to see the screen. He tried contacting Microsoft, they were useless.
I got burned on the original Surface when it came out (I had an RT which was horrible, so I traded for a Pro with Win8). That Surface got slower and slower with its many, many updates, to where the system was so bogged down that it was unusable. On top of that, hardware challenges began to show after a few weeks and by month three I loved it a lot less than on Day One. So I waited a few months before reviewing this laptop to see if it had similar issues.Fortunately, Microsoft seems to have ironed out a lot of the issues. This laptop may not have all the cool-hip factor of a convertible tablet, but its full-sized keyboard and solid casing are eminently practical while its feather weight and ultra-slim profile still keep it in the fashionably-cool category. Mine has and i5 processor and 8GB of RAM and that seems adept at most things I do (it's only a little sluggish with some games like Forza 6 and with Access). Were I chronically trying to do either, I would splurge for the i7/16GB, but the entry set will work for most tasks.The keyboard is responsive. My only gripe is my 30-year history of right-handed Control+Enter is busted by this keyboard's layout, which replaces the right control key with a menu key and no easy way to re-map it. It is backlight, but more a hint of backlit than my VAIO or Alienware, which actually makes it more eye-friendly in the dark. The large track pad is very responsive and reads the full range of touch and swipe options (some of which are turned off my default - weird).The aluminum case is sharp looking, though my dented pretty easily while in my laptop bag with my mouse. The power cord attach is magnetic, with a bar clip that makes aligning it a snap (ba da ch!). I will say the battery default power setting lets it drain pretty quickly, so if you're like me and use yours while flying, you may consider switching to lower-power options (this gets me from about 6 hours of heavy use to 12 - a nice leap, especially considering it's not the fastest charging device).Finally, for what it's worth: I do not like Win10S any more than I liked Win8RT. I know it makes the system lighter, faster, and more Android/iOS-ish, but it also makes it impossible to run my work software, any legacy software, and just in general I reject the idea (been using Microsoft since the DOS 3.0 days, so I guess I'm stuck in the mindset of me telling my computer what it will do, not the other way around). So for my 2 cents, just upgrade to full Windows 10 when you get it. The upgrade is free for the remainder of 2017, and only $50 beginning in 2018 (purchase via the Windows Store).
I purchased this with the Surface Dock and the dock quit charging the computer after 40 days and it is not returnable after 30 days. Very disappointed.
The purchase of a Surface laptop has been the most negative customer experience of my life. And I've dealt with banks and insurance companies.I bought the Laptop in early August and was happy at first, as it seemed like a good alternative to the MacBook / Pro. After about 45 days of light to no use, the laptop failed completely and tech support was unable to resolve, so refund / replacement was the only option.I thought about it and based on the news that had recently come out re Consumer Reports and the very high failure rate, I opted for refund, as my spidey sense told me this product had been rushed to market. I asked for a refund; as I was at 45 days vice 30, the request would have to be referred up for approval, response in 24-36 hours. Fine. A week goes by, nothing heard - I call, they advise 'your request has been denied.' Fine, I'll go with replacement, sell it on Kijiji, buy a MacBook. They send me ... a refurb. A highish end laptop fails after 45 days and MS believes a refurb is a fair trade. Now I'll have difficulty selling the laptop. I call back and say no way, not acceptable. They say 'just go in person into the store, they'll give you a brand new one.' The nearest store is 4 hours by car, can't do, have to do it via courier. They say 'We can't send a new laptop via courier, if you're genuinely not happy, ask for a refund'. I advise already tried, no success. They said, no, I'm looking at your file, a refund was never requested. So I waited for a week just to find out that first agent lied outright to me.Bottom line - I'm more than 2 weeks without a laptop, have spent in excess of 7 hours on the phone they consistently refuse to refer me to head office or any other level of customer support that might be able to authorize replacement with a new computer via courier. Apparently only Bill Gates himself could authorize such a thing, and he's busy. They have have ignored queries sent over email, Facebook and Twitter. This is what you can expect when your Surface fails.My sincere recommendation is buy a MacBook; the reliability is one thing, but the arrogance and ineffectiveness of MS customer service team is what makes me certain I WILL NEVER BUY A PIECE OF MS HARDWARE FOR ME OR MY FAMILY AGAIN. I've never had a major failure of an Apple desktop or laptop, when I've had issues with peripheral devices they have replaced even out of warranty.The product is not ready for market, the company is not willing to work with the poor suckers who got on early to try to find a good outcome. I will be buying a MacBook as soon as this circus is resolved.
We have several tablets in our family, but this is actually the first laptop we have used in a few years. The Microsoft Surface Laptop combines some of the best features of a tablet, such as touch screen capability, thin and lightweight portability, and features like facial recognition software, with some of the dedicated laptop features that I have been wanting for a while, such as a permanent keyboard and touch pad. At less than three pounds, this really is a remarkable unit that boasts the power of a PC with the footprint of an iPad Pro.There are a few features here that I especially appreciate, such as the surprisingly soft textured keyboard cover that I was not at all expecting. Not only does the speckled gray color blend nicely with the laptop exterior, but it's easy on my wrist and fingers when typing or scrolling along the touch pad. Beyond the keyboard, which is much sturdier than the portable Bluetooth keyboards that I have used with my iPad over the years (that consistently fall apart after a few months), this responsive touchscreen works just as well as my iPad Air 2. It's very easy to shift from keyboard to touch pad to touchscreen depending upon what I am working on or trying to accomplish.Although I have not used many laptops in recent years, I found this unit to be very reliable and on point based on my knowledge of what is available in the market. The 8GG RAM makes this unit quite fast and responsive--in fact one of the best I have encountered on a PC. As with most modern laptops, the hard drive is solid state which allows for greater ease and reliability when travelling. The drive has 256GB which holds plenty of video, music, and document files. I use this to supplement my larger desktop computer at home, but it is perfectly functional and has the capacity to serve as someone's primary or only PC on a regular day-to-day basis.I am in a unique position in terms of brand loyalty because I have almost excessively been a Microsoft user in terms of computers while at the time only really using Apple mobile devices. There is definitely a convergence of styles here with this laptop. In fact, just looking at the white box with its minimalist, streamlined design, I could have sworn I was opening an iPad Pro or something similar from Apple. Even the charger is somewhat reminiscent of an Apple unit (although in black). If you are traditionally a MacBook user, I think you will find plenty to like with this Surface Laptop. All in all, I was very impressed and will make good use of this at home, in the office, and on the go.
I truly wanted to like this laptop. But after buying 2 (1 from Best Buy and the other from the Microsoft Store) and experiencing the same problem, I have to call it quits. I can't find anyone else talking about this problem: there is sound distortion, and it's not a defect, it's simply an effect of the design. Let me explain.The speakers in this laptop are placed somewhere under the keyboard. When the sound is turned high up (typically 70/100 or higher), and under certain music, the sound waves coming from the speakers under the keyboard cause some of the chiclet keys to vibrate a lot. These vibrations produce high pitched buzzing noises. The kind of music I have found this most noticeable on is classic piano music. At first I thought I had a busted speaker. However upon returning the laptop and getting another with the same problem, I had to do some investigating. Eventually I found that when I touch some keys to prevent them from vibrating, the distortion goes away, and when I let go it comes back.I simply can't deal with this. It is extremely noticeable to me. Otherwise this laptop is great. It has the best keyboard of all the ones I've tested which was really important to me. Such a shame...
Perfect laptop for students, especially you already own a powerful workstation. The device is light and thin. The screen ratio is different from many other laptops, but it works really fine for reading and coding. The color is amazing.The touch screen helps sometimes, but using surface pen on the laptop doesn't give good experience. The touchpad feels smooth and supports many gestures. WIndows hello is really handy and fast.One of the speaker of my device is flawed, but i got the compensation. Some people may need more USB ports.
So far a great laptop that more than exceeds what I need in a daily work computer. Plenty fast and reliable with no issues to date. Screen is great just wish that it would open to a larger angle. Keys and trackpad are among the best I have used in a windows laptop with perfect travel and response. Combined with the dock and an external monitor it really is a pleasure to work on.
Microsoft has been really impressive recentlyâfirst the Surface Studio and now this gorgeous piece of kit. Iâm a big fan of the latest tech and the Surface Laptop is a âmust-have.â?The fancy keyboard material is quite a nice touch and the screen is very clear. Plus itâs touch screen, which makes Appleâs touch bar look even more laughable. Recommended for anyone who is disillusioned with the other offerings. Or really anyone who wants a top of the line laptop.
Let me start by saying Iâve been an Apple-only user until recently. I use my MacBook Pro for work and my iPad when Iâm traveling. Iâve been traveling more and more as of late, and I find that the iPad really canât do everything I need. For the amount of time I spend on an airplane, I need a fully functional device capable of heavier lifting than the iPad. But for the amount of time I spend trekking through airports, I need a device that I can carry easily in my shoulder bag. The MacBook Pro starts to feel heavy when Iâm on the long march between concourses. So Iâve been looking for a new computer that can replace both the iPad and the Mac, and I think Microsoft might have just created it.The Surface Laptop is very sleek. The fact that you can open it with one finger is super helpful for me as Iâm often on the phone while on my computer, and now I can use one hand for each. I also like that theyâve made it with fabric rather than just all metal. Much nicer especially when it gets cold outside; no more cold fingers from the cold metal of my computer.What I like most though is that Microsoft has optimized this device for security. The Windows 10 S operating system is such a smart idea. How great to be able to go anywhereâin style!âand not have to worry about my computer being safe from viruses.I have to say, Iâm becoming a convert. I never thought Iâd leave Apple but Iâm so impressed with what Microsoft is doing. First the Surface Studio and now the Surface Laptopâ¦I guess weâre going to be a Windows household soon!
I am switch from Macbook retina, and I noticed that the surface laptop is must lighter and Windows 10 run very smoothly on this laptop.I have a gaming laptop that has much better specs but feels slower than this one.The only problem is that the plastic touchpad is not as good as mac
The best laptop we ever owned. I bought for my wife to replace macbook air, she uses it everyday, no issue and great windows experience. I sometimes uses it for a few minutes (as second user) and windows hello logs me in quickly. In general, best laptop on market.
quicker and durable.
I will keep this plain, simple, and short. Get this laptop, if you want a laptop that just works. It's expensive, yeah. But after having this for two months, it truly feels like the first Windows Laptop that I can fully trust to last 4-6 years with no issue. Stick to the core i5 with 256 gigs of storage model if you do everyday tasks. it's the best bang for you buck model. Good luck!
Love the laptop. My only complaint is the felt cover on the keyboard area I don't care for.Also, I do not like that there is not a default DVD playing software like W. Media Player used to do, so I had to DL VLC.however, the upgrade to Windows 10 pro was free and painless. I am looking to get the pen as well. Pretty good laptop overall. My use is for heavy excel use and online school.
went from mac air to this and glad i did
Packing was awesome, computer works good and came in perfect conditions.So far everything is working well. Will update if i notice something !
This is replacing my 2012 13 Inch MacBook Pro and its a great upgrade. The core i5 is a perfect performance for what Iâm using it for, and I think Anybody could like it. Itâs design is really good, and the keyboard is the best Iâve had.
Great product product
I just love using this device. I have the i5 8GB, and it feels very snappy. Great build quality as well.
Love this laptop! I just spilled half a mug of tea on the laptop and it's fine. Appears that the fabric is waterproof like Window said!
At first, everything worked well. I upgraded to regular Windows 10 so that I can install software unlike previous Windows version. Everything worked great for 3 months. The only issue I had was the face recognition sign in, which seemed to only work about a fifth of the time. It's also a pity that the monitor wasn't 360 degrees too. However, overall I really liked the laptop. It was nice and light, and could fit in my purse really well. However, after 3 months, it just stopped working without any reason. There was no physical damage to the laptop whatsoever, I simply closed it like normal one night, and it wouldn't boot up 2 hours later. Monitor went black, and only the keyboard would light up. So while it was working, it worked great despite the iffy face recognition sign in. The touch screen was sensitive enough, and it woke up from sleep reasonably well timed. I've contacted Microsoft support and thankfully there is a 1 year warrante, however, it means they will simply just probably replace it with refurbished one. It's a bit saddening that it only lasted 3 months or so and that now anything on it will be wiped. Hopefully, the next laptop will be longer lasting. Overall, in working shape, it was relatively a 4 star. My only complaints were the face sign in, it wasn't 360 degrees bendable, and the magnetic charging chord often would fall out.
Awesome computer!
I gave this laptop to my husband to replace his big, clunky, slow Dell laptop. He took a look at it and declared it "too wimpy".. then opened it up, turned it on, and completely changed his tune. He now thinks it's the best laptop he's owned. It is small - but good things, they say, come in small packages. It is lightening fast. Husband is in finance and uses Excel. He opens up so many files at once, and does huge cut and paste between files. While his Dell would bog down and churn during these situations, the Microsoft Surface performs quickly and efficiently. Husband also loves the touch screen, though he was dubious at first. He adapted to it quickly and now prefers the touch screen to his old mouse.The laptop was easy to set up, right out of the box. The Introduction Screens walk you through setting up Wi-Fi, Cortana and a few other features. Simple for anyone. The graphics on the screen are amazing - clear and extremely high quality. We were both surprised to find no SD card port and it needs a different HDMI cable (mini display cord adapter $39). Apparently, you have to order a special (and pricey) compatible mouse ($79).We're no digital wizards or techie's. We're just folks who like to use our laptops for a variety of tasks, from watching videos and playing games (me) to processing Excel files and scrolling through online auctions (him).The fabric that surrounds the keyboard is nice, but I have to wonder how difficult it will be to clean. Another feature we don't care for is the fact you can't order up a new battery replacement. I assume you have to send the entire laptop to Microsoft for replacement. Another pricey venture, I'm sure. We both wish the tablet part of the laptop disconnected to be used independently.Pro's: it's fast, it's got great graphics, it's lightweight, it's got a touch screen.Con's: The usual accessories don't fit, pricey replacement accessories, no user battery replacement, no standard HDMI port, no SD card.It's a debate whether to give this laptop 3 or 4 stars, but the speed and graphics make up for a lot.
This comes in a box that reminds one of a big box of 1950s Christmas chocolates--and the contents are even nicer! My machine is platinum, and it looks impressive. Better than the external vibe is the inside. The screen is vivid, by any standard. The keys in the keyboard are bigger than any I have ever seen in a computer or laptop. The texture of the surface of the keyboard and mouse area reminds me of Ultrasuede. Of course, best of all, it fired with ease. Compact, but full service.
The battery is awesome this laptop is perfect for students the only problem here that its not upgradeable so you need be aware of your usage
Unfortunately there have been an array of problems since purchase. I believe this may be the particular product sold by the seller.
Happy with the item.
I have this laptop for 1 week now. everything is perfect for me except the way they built this laptop.the battery certainly isn't replaceable, it will be a problem if you are planning using this laptop for more than 3 years.I guess it will be few hundreds since they claim they will have a service for replacing the "entire laptop" for users.Well, the question is, will you pay that much for the service?
I hate this damn computer. The app store is very limited. If you are a andriod user this is not for you (smartphone). YouTube, Amazon, google drive, google maps, and most other popular apps are not available to you. If Msft would create more apps then it would be ok. Now I am looking to get rid of it. It is worthless.
Great computer in many ways. But a proprietary charger instead of USB-C is beyond stupid. A second charger will cost an obscene $80.
Poor quality.Broken after a few weeks.Expert says it's not repairable.
If your Surface device goes bad after warranty you are out of luck. I have a surface 3 that started having issues after 21 months of use. It was not abused. There is no repair service just a replacement charge of $320.00! This for a device that new was 500.00. This is completely absurd. If your Surface Book goes bad after 12 months it will be $600.00 to get it replaced and no option to get it repaired.Microsoft has reliability issues as documented by Consumers Report with 25 % of users having issues by the end of the second year. According to Consumers Reports this is much higher than other manufactures. My experience with Dell was much better for an out of warranty defect. They replaced a laptop that had a motherboard issue at no cost.My Surface 3 mini displayport does not work and it also has an issue with every USB device disconnecting then connecting again 5 times a minute when connected to the dock. This means it is continuously chirping unless I turn the sound down. I wonder what is next. Evidently Microsoft thinks this is normal.Microsoft Technical Support people have been prolite but totally useless offering no troubleshooting knowledge that I didnât already know.Out-of-warranty service fees by productâ?United States (currency US-USD)Surface Pro 3 $599.00Surface 3 $310.00Surface 3 (LTE) $310.00Surface Pro 4 $450.00Surface Book $599.00Surface Studio $899.00Surface Laptop $450.00Surface Pro (latest) $450.00
DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!!!!! IT COMES WITH WINDOWS 10S, AND IT IS TERRIBLE.
You won't be disappointed. Does exactly what it's supposed to do.
There are many reviews out there that will tell you most of the intricacies of owning this computer, but there is a thing or two I did not see mentioned before so I would like to put it out for those few people who may find them important.To start politely, if you are looking for a laptop computer, you should seriously consider this one. It has all the potential you may want. It is just that it has limitations, too.First trivia about it is that the power button is located on the keyboard. It is between other buttons, not bigger and not smaller, just one of the buttons there. It is not even the one in the corner, it is the second one from the right in the top row. You will get used to it, but the choice of the position is unexpected, at least.Much more important to me is the fact that computer is practically barely usable unless you open the Microsoft Store account. It does not work straight from the box in the way computers should. Well, it will work with what comes preinstalled on it, but nothing else. A lot has been written about pros and deficiencies of Windows 10 S so I will skip those details, but you are not going to install anything on them without Microsoft Store account. Every review on every tech site will tell you that it qualifies for FREE upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and then you will be able to install programs the way you are used to with no limitations. Unfortunately, no website mentioned that Windows 10 Pro cannot be installed/upgraded to without Microsoft Store account. In case you thought that paying serious money to get a computer with operating system should be enough, you are out of your naÃ¯ve luck. You will be able to meaningfully use that same computer only if you join the Microsoft Store club from which you may not have any intention to ever buy anything. Where is the rationale for asking gender and date of birth to open an account for upgrading to the operating system you were promised you would be able to easily upgrade to after you paid for the computer is open to discussion.Aside of that Apple-esque idea, I think the computer may be good for those who have Microsoft Store accounts and do not feel fooled by not being able to upgrade without joining the club. For the rest of us, it is a machine that could, but failed to deliver due to pre-installed software limitations.Please note, reviews of the new computer are not of the feel of the buttons or softness of the Alcantra only. They involve preintalled software and ability to use the item without having to jump through the unadvertised hoops.
Initially I bought this through Amazon but cancelled quickly when I realized Microsoft offers a student discount. So far I have had this 2 days and it has not been bad but it certainly has not been great either. I don't think I had Windows 10 S for an hour before I quickly upgraded it Windows 10 Pro. As stated before Windows 10 S will NOT let you install 3rd party applications unless they are in the Microsoft store. So that means you are stuck with limited VPN options, Edge Browser, and a ton of other limitations. The trade off is real and significant. For Windows 10 Pro you can install the programs you want; however rest assured your battery life will suffer tremendously. I was at 100% about 20 minutes ago but after moderate use (no streaming videos or music) I am down to 92%. I think it is fair to say Windows 10 Pro kills the battery life Microsoft touted as being amazing. Microsoft informs users that you can downgrade back to Windows 10 S if you choose free of charge. The touch screen is nice as is the material surrounding the keyboard. The screen resolution is absolutely on point. I have the i5 8GB 256 GB model and I have to say it is much slower than I anticipated. It looks like many others are reporting the same thing. I'm not sure the more expensive i7 would make that much of a difference. In addition, the facial recognition software to unlock your computer is inconsistent at best and I could totally see myself strictly using the pin procedure to access if it keeps up its shenanigans. All and all it is a good attempt by Microsoft, does it beat it's Macbook Air counterpart? In my opinion, no. As I am deeply entrenched in both ecosystems, Apple and Microsoft (I love both) I can say with the utmost confidence that it is a good computer but not great and certainly not worth the hefty $1299 price tag.
Everything I expected. Thanks
For the price...this unit lacks an SD reader, and HTML port. (and USB ports?)...Until Microsoft improves these models...I shall not purchase one....
Got super excited about buying the new Surface laptop and the excitement pretty much ended as soon as I took it out if the box. I won't talk about the lack of USB-C ports, or the longevity of the Alacantara surface material because Tech. websites cover that in detail. I will give you my personal everyday user experience:So opening the laptop is not easy, by easy I mean i should not be struggling to open the screen when I supposedly bought the laptop with the ebst design in the market. There is no hinge, or a little gap for you to slide your thumb in to open the damn thing.The laptop moves around a lot when placed on even slightly polished surfaces. I was at a local coffee shop and it kept moving as I was typing.I could not even connect to the WiFi at the coffee shop. I clicked on the network and it kept trying to connect me for the next 5min. Finally, after looking up an article about this problem with Surface laptop on my Iphone, I had to RESET my Wifi settings on my new laptop for it to work. It's 2017, and this is not acceptable for a machine this expensive or any tech. product no matter the cost.The screen colors are not something I am familiar with. I haven't looked too much in to that but the display has a very unfamiliar shade of white that I am not used to.The laptop is not Up-gradable, meaning 2-3 years in to the future when you decide to upgrade the RAM or storage, you can't. That's a big setback because laptops slow down with time and not being able to upgrade it will cost you well A NEW LAPTOP.So it's been about 2 days since I've had this and the day I started using it, in about 3 hours I had already ordered a Refurbished Macbook Pro, 13" Oct 2016 release date(Same Price). Now, I am just waiting for that lovely piece of machinery to show up at the Apple store so I can return this sad attempt at recreating the Macbook by my neighbors in Seattle.
Every thing looks OK, but, what is the screen size?????
here are two no go's for me:1.) No replaceable battery. Battery is glued and the device is some sort of welded together. You cant not open it without damaging the device.2.) The SSD is soldered (=not removable). this means data is not recoverable if you damage the device or if something other than the SSD fails.If you can live with this it is a decent device.
To me a computer either does everything it's supposed to or it's worthless. Trying to fix the fact that you can't search for words in email in Microsoft Outlook I was told "our engineers are aware of that problem and we are working on a solution". Unacceptable.
This isn't a machine meant for heavy-duty server work or top-tier gaming. That aside, this tiny machine makes a great device for young adults looking for something mobile to take with them to high school or college. It comes with the essentials to be productive, as well as a full-blown and modern windows operating system. The revolving camera is a nice touch, as well as the drain holes in the bottom for accidental spills on the keyboard. It feels very sturdy and viable as a machine, with only one true flaw. The 64GB of storage flies fast when you're installing applications, writing up essays and doing powerpoints. My advice is buy a 64GB microSD card to compliment this machine or at the very least some form of external storage.
A long story on this purchase.I originally bought a different notebook as a gift for my mother. ( I know it says laptop, but I consider it more of a notebook). My son and I looked at a lot of different notebooks and finally decided on an Acer Chromebook. My son is very familiar with computers, laptops and notebooks (has a computer science degree) so he was shocked when he found out it did not allow him to install icons on the desktop. The icons all were on the bottom of the computer. My mother is ninety-years-old and wanted her notebook to look just like her computer. So we looked again and bought this one for her. Just yesterday my mother mentioned she really loves it.. She works on a lot of crossword puzzles and normally would get up and look up a clue on her computer if she was stumped. Now she has the notebook right next to her on the couch. If she is watching a show and something piques her curiosity she can look it up while still watching the show. My son set it up with the same programs as her computer with all the similar icons and she says it is very easy to use. Now I am not criticizing the Chromebook, but we were all surprised when we saw it. This Laptop (Notebook?) was a great purchase.
I wanted a machine for email, internet, and various office functions. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. IT is slow when you're use to tablets and high speed computers with "instant on". After it's on, it works very good. It is also lite and easy to carry with a good battery life and screen.
Bought this for my flight attendant. Laptops take a beating when every day is a trip through security, etc. This is light and everything she needed in a computer. My only issue is some of they keys are a bit small for my fingers, but I'm not the one using it.
Great PC, did everything I needed for school. I had to return it because it did not have the correct version of Windows. It claimed to have windows 10 pro, but in fact had a non-genuine copy of windows enterprise.
There is something really wrong with this Lenovo. Keys get stuck so you can't use keyboard. Had it for about a month before the issue started but you hit one key and get a completely different letter or other times it seems like the function key is stuck on all the time so press a key and it triggers a function. Read that a lot of others have had the same experience. That aside it wasn't very user-friendly. Spend a little more for a quality product...spending money on this is like.tossing money out the window.
The person I bought this for has so far been very happy with this laptop for several months. Battery lasts a very long time and it is nice and lightweight. Perfect for what we needed.
A bit slower than i expected.
Arrived in perfect condition and works great... just wish I used it as much as I thought I would.
Is quite capable considering the price.
It's a very sturdy laptop. Although it's a celeron processir but works fine with YouTube, Ms office. Surfing etc. Very handy for traveling.
Purchased this almost 6 weeks ago. Nice windows 10 laptop. It does everything I ask it to without hesitation. I really like it's size, but wish the keyboard was lighted. I would recommend the Lenovo brand to my friends and family.
Seems like a great little computer, unfortunately there was a printed mark inside the display. There was no way to remove the mark without opening the computer up. It looks like the one I ordered got by quality control. We will be buying another one as soon as we get refunded for the first computer.
I had to return this laptop because the screen kept fluttering. It gave me terrible eyestrain and headache. I had ordered this very enthusiastically and was really dismayed to have to return it. I discovered this the day we opened and tried to use it which was a couple of weeks after it arrived. I hope Amazon returns our full money. We hardly used it due to the screen display problem.
Nice computer for the kids school stuff. They work well so far.
It wasn't what I was looking for so in ordered my Daughter a bigger Lenovo
Small and handy. Great for my office work. Not sure if it would work with games and stuff.
Perfect size for traveling, my husband loves it.
I love it. Very good product. Thank you
This is a great little laptop, well worth the money!
I have had this for a couple months and sadly I really dislike it. It is so slow. If I type my name, my fingers will be finished typing before the first letter appears on the screen.The computer is constantly âworkingâ?- the machine is running, making all sorts of noise, when I am doing simple things like reading the news online, with no other programs open. It takes forever to scroll down on webpages, and the problem is not our internet, as we can easily browse on our tablets and phones. In fact, I am writing this review on my iPad as this Lenovo computer is just too clunky to even write an amazon review in a timely manner!
This laptop has worked great. It's used for only for work/school purposes, not gaming. For the intents it was purchased for, it has been awesome. Additionally, it lightweight and easy to move around with/handle. Solid value.
Do not buy! I sent this Computer back today. Pathetically slow. No way a 2.4 Ghz processor! Took forever to load updates.
Save your hard earn money and buy something else. I can't stress enough how hot garbage this POS laptop is. IT IS SOOOOOO SLOW! All I have on it is windows office like word, power point, excel, etc. and you would think i have 10000000GB stored on here because it is THAT SLOW! I open up a window nothing happens okay I click on it again then all a sudden 15 windows open and lord have mercy buckle in because its going to take 50 minutes to try to close that. THEN it would randomly shut it self down after 5 minutes of inactivity! I have changed all the settings I could to stop it but nothing would work and btw everyone has ben googling the fix with no help! PLEASE PLEASE save your hard earn money and get something else!
My new Lenovo laptop is Awesome , it has all the features anyone would want on a computer , super fast shipping !! I would highly recommend this product , and anyone would recognize the Lenovo name , this is one truly awesome computer !!!
Bought as a replacement for a 10 year old Lenovo T500 at work. Positives: Screen, price. Boot-up time is much better after deleting bloatware. Google "How to remove windows 10 bloatware". It's not the lightest, fastest or most power efficient laptop, but at $250 (1/4 the price of a phone) it does a great job.
Worse computer I've ever buy in my life slow like snail can't run even properly with just a couple open windows i.e like document or a music file open it freezes or takes forever to respond,should have an option where you can put no star ð
Slow as can be. Although aesthetically well designed, the parts used to manufacture it are flimsy and problematic especially the keyboard mouse (right and left clicking). Never more disappointed. I should have returned it immediately. Its become a tabletop riser for my original thinkpad. Not worth the perceived savings.
DONt know why but the sound keeps messing up. Other wise good product shipping was on point!
Decent laptop but does seem to run a little slow. Also had a hard time getting on the other day, would not accept my pin, kept having to restart the computer, haven't had it long enough for these types of issues already.
Great and good looking laptop, but there's only one problem that I assumed everyone (who brought this laptop) is facing with their Lenovo laptop.. LAGGING! This laptop keeps on lagging and I can't figure out why. I went to task manager to check the CPU, but nothing. Everytime when I watch a video on this laptop, it keeps on lagging the video or even sometimes freezes. Lenovo should figure out how to fix this issue as soon as possible. Other than that, the package came with everything (as new) and never had an issue with missing materials.
It's insanely slow ... loading, start-up, buffering ... it's literally the worst computer I've ever purchased.
very slowwwwwwww. the worst laptop i have ever.
It froze up on me from the very beginning!?? Idk if I just received a lemon or what but I had to return it and am looking for the perfect touchscreen laptop on the market and am willing to pay in the ballpark of $400-less than $600 if possible! Needed for home use and the best program for pictures?? Can anyone help me find what Iâm looking for???
This was the worst computer ever had it for 2 weeks and only used it 2 times and keyboard stopped working
The computer eas slow at first the apps didnt open quickly but if your patient with it and give it a chance it will work id say 4 out of 5 because of that
This is a great laptop for its price; powers up smoothly and is user friendly
It started getting slow after downloading Microsoft Office. Just couldn't handle school work.
This is the worst laptop I've ever had the displeasure of owning. Returned it after 2 weeks. Only boots about 50% of the time, constant boot Bios errors, hardware crashing, constqnt 99% CPU usage. LENOVO made a piece of junk here. In my 15 years of repairing computers, this is the crappiest I've seen right out of the box.
My old Lenovo Notebook finally died or at least the hard drive. Thanks to the great selection at Amazon I found an ideal replacement.Couldn't be happier with the IdeaPad. It meets my needs perfectly.
Is te Best laptop i beber hace befor i like it
This computer runs very slow for every program. Even trying to open pictures is a 5-minute process. Anyone out there that can help me?
Slow startup, freezes sometimes. Web browsing is too slow in IE as well as Chrome, jerky when watching video on Youtube etc. Won't recommend this product to anyone.
Battery life is terrible and the laptop runs a bit slow.
A nice laptop, I highly recommend. A lot of computer for a great price.
Pretty slow, but it works
So far so good, we like it and hope it gives us a few good years.
Itâs a decent computer. Great for the price, itâs just little slower that I wanted
Please note that I received the Lenovo laptop today in Barbados. I'm now about to charge it.I like it's sleek design. I provide more feedback in a few days
Product worked well and was very satisfied. However, updates indicated a Windows 10 update and after we ran the update, we had no sound. Despite hours of downloading drivers and researching the issue, still no sound. So the brand new computer will need service. Daughter started college and this is not a problem you expect after one day. Update: There is a known issue with Windows 10!!!!! Buyer beware!!!!
For the price, I paid this turned out to be a very good laptop. There were a few hiccups that occurred but otherwise, the laptop is performing as described.Thanks.
Piece of junk. Freezes and extremely slow!!!!
Proving a slow disappointment. But it will store files. No good for games.
Fast. Works great!!
This laptop has had problem after problem since I purchased it:- Speakers wouldnât work- Goes to sleep after 2 minutes even though sleep settings set at 20 minutes- Sleep issue resolved and then reappeared multiple times- Laptop slowed down to the point where it was unusable. Did some investigation and discovered it was running at 100% CPU capacity. I removed multiple programs, nothing, ran diagnostics, nothing, ran windows uninstall program which uninstalls all software and only reloads windows, nothing. It runs at 100% CPU just with Windows installed and nothing else running.Now I see that the return window is closed in Amazon so I am stuck with this thing. I am going to mess with it a little more and if I canât fix it Iâm going smash it with a baseball bat. At least that will give me a little bit of satisfaction for the money I spent on this thing. Bottom line...donât waste your time with this piece of junk. Spend a little more and get a real laptop.
Very sleek and light weight, offers everything I was looking for in a laptop. Customer service super easy and prompt to work with.
Wow- the absolute slowest computer I have ever owned. Other than that, it works OK. You just need a ton of patience.
received item, keyboard wasn't working properly and the mouse pad is inferior (shakey).
I bought this less than 3 months ago and have been using it as a secondary computer. I have literally used it for less than 20 hours in total over the last 3 months and so far- apps randomly disappear and have to be reinstalled, my touchpad mouse became inoperable (I had to reinstall the drivers twice), and now I have a blue screen and an error that says RPC server unavailable.I need to find out a way to return this asap before I toss it out the window. This is total junk
Started having issues less than 2 months of having it. It wants me to insert recovery media which I never received.
I'll be returning this laptop if it runs as soon as it starts up,it's so slow I'm highly pissed. This should have cost 50-60 bucks
Loved it, but there was a problem with the RAM, kept getting a error notice. Sent back. Refunded.
I love it. Its works well especially when I can split the screens and do 2 things at once.. worth the money..
It works great a temporary computer for me, umtil I build a gaming pc in the future
Followed the instructions out of the box through all of the tedious steps for set up, expecting that things would speed up after everything was finished...wrong! This is the slowest computer that I have used since the age of dial-up internet. Take your 10 year old laptop out of the closet and dust it off...you will probably prefer it to this pathetic excuse for a computer.
Very good quality. Am so happy with this good loptop. Thank you Lenovo.
I was surprised at the level of performance. I have had this about a month now. I bought it to replace a 6 year old laptop. I thought any purchase of a new laptop would be a little faster and it actually slower. I use it for emails, social media and checking bank and investment websites. I do have a home surveillance program with four cameras running constantly but I had this on my last laptop too.I cannot seem to view simple YouTube videos. If I do full screen, the video stops completely. All other videos just do that circling signal looking for something. Changing websites takes forever. It just blanks out for a while. It also has delayed responses if I click on a function.I didn't spend a lot which I was pleased with, but maybe I should have spent a little more.My internet speed is very fast.
It's pretty good for the price. I would recommend it if you just need it for basic browsing.
I like the capability bit it craahes a lot. I sent baxk two of them
It doesn't have backlit keys like it was advertised as having. Pretty slow also.
Like the storage
The images are great! its lightweight.
Slow, unresponsive, didnt boot up on first use
I hate this computer...it lags alot
Excellent products
Works perfect.
I was expecting faster 3X wifi speed and instead the PC CPU goes to 100% in use with almost no apps running making this PC unusable. What a Scam, next time i will pick the HP instead, Lenovo is a slow unusable model for a PC.
My prior computer had a very jumpy keyboard, perhaps because I'm left handed and that area of the computer caused jumps to earlier parts of the text. I'm relieved this one doesn't. Not pleased with Microsoft's game of charging each year for Windows.
My in laws are enjoying it!
Doesnât eve turn on after on week. Returned.
So far, I love this computer, the best computer for the price.
gift for my daughter . .. she loves it. I have a Lenovo 110 and am very happy with it.
Really happy with my purchase. No regrets
Product as described. Fast shipping.
Pretty but slow for a product boasting fast Wi-Fi .Even after I cleaned all of the junk out of it. I returned it. I also reviewed it along with other 1 and 2 star reviews on the post purchased from but that Is gone. ???
The Lenovo 320 laptop is sold with a Celeron processor and 4gb of memory for $199 at "Big Box" stores and with more powerful processors and 6gb or 8gb of memory for $300 to $500.I have the basic $199 version which does a good job for email, preparing short documents and watching Netflix. It has a nice screen, a DVD drive and its battery lasts two or three hours while streaming movies.It lacks the power needed for demanding games or graphics programs such as Photoshop. Due to flaws in the 2018 Microsoft Edge browser you must install the Chrome browser to watch Netflix or long videos.Windows 10 requires three long days of update after update to replace the factory version of Windows with the newest version. During the updates the computer runs too slowly to be useful. After the updates are fully completed the computer runs smoothly. You might need to edit BIOS to disable the "Intel PTT" feature that controls PIN code sign in to Windows. The PIN code sign in feature of Windows 10 can lock the CPU at 100% load, slowing the computer to a crawl. Sign in using your regular Microsoft password instead.The $199 version is too basic for most families. Windows 10 requires a Pentium i3 or i5 processor for $400 to $600 to run graphics games and demanding software.
It came infected from the factory. I didn't have it connected to the internet, or even set up, when it started "warning" me that all of my information was being stolen and to call a number to fix everything now. Funny, considering there wasn't any information on it. It completely locked up before set up. Before that, some of the keys didn't work. This is a case of too good to be true.
I have had this computer for several months now and absolutely love it! It's fast and much better than the Dell I bought this to replace. I'm amazed at how quiet this computer it. Very light weight too. Doesn't have a touchscreen but I found I rarely used the touchscreen on my Dell, so don't miss not having it. I would and just did recommend this computer! I'm a writer and this computer is perfect for what I need one for!
Iâve had this laptop for less than 6 months and the WiFi connectivity is absolutely terrible. It disconnects every 30-60 seconds. I tried to troubleshoot it with Lenovo and they blamed the router.... Iâm writing this on my phone connected to the same router..... Poor quality product
This laptop is amazing for the price I bought it at, I got it for $329.99 on Best Buy, however for the $449 they are offering it on here for there are many other, more cost effective options. Getting the 8gb of RAM combined with the 1 TB Hard Drive and very very nice A12-9720p processor is just unbeatable at $330. This laptop can easily play games like Minecraft, Terraria, and the Binding of Isaac. It can also play games like Borderlands 2, Bioshock, and Star Wars: The Old Republic very well at reduced settings. I got this laptop for my upcoming college semester and I know it'll handle that with ease
This laptop is a very powerful machine and a great value for all of the hardware features.Pros:powerful quad core amd 2.7 GHZ 2017 CPU with turbo boost up to 3.6 GHZ8 Gig DDR4 ram, expandable to 16 gig ddr4 ram1 TB hard driveUSB Type-C (future proof your household)2 USB 3.01 HDMIWebcamDVD-RW DriveBluetoothAC wifi (future proof your household)Thin and sturdy constructionRadeon R7 GPUCons:I have read that some folks expected a brighter screenBattery lasts a couple of hours of regular useI researched all of the specifications of this laptop, and I just was not able to get these awesome hardware specs without spending over $500. I was looking for at least a quad-core cpu, and at least 4 gigs of DDR4 ram. Usually laptops with 8 gigs of DDR4 ram are well over $500. Many budget laptops today still have DDR3 ram, and usually have 4 gigs of DDR3 ram. We might as well future proof our experience with USB Type-C, and AC wifi so our purchase isn't outdated for a couple of years at least. The 1 Terra-byte hard drive is more than enough space for a lifetime, but is also what is holding this laptop back. I went ahead and purchased an external HDD enclosure, and a Samsung evo 850 500 GB solid state hard drive. I transferred my data to the Samsung SSD, installed the SSD into the laptop, and reused the 1 terra-byte HDD which came in the laptop as an external 1 TB drive. This laptop completely starts and is all ready to be used in aproximately 2-3 seconds after pressing the ON button with the solid state drive. With the solid state drive, this machine is really comparable to other laptops which cost $800 and above. I have had my laptop only for about a month, and I love it so far! I am a student, and I primarily use my laptop for research and homework at school, but I also play some games on it too. I immediately purchased a soft neoprene case for this laptop, and put the laptop in the neoprene case, which goes into my padded backpack laptop pocket to protect my investment. This laptop is so powerful with awesome hardware that I thought about purchasing 2 of them because it's a steal. I'll report back in the future if I run into any issues, but I am extremely happy with my future proof and powerful laptop at this price!
UPDATE 1: Yes, the "R7 graphics" on this chip is indeed the 512 GCN shaders version, not the weaker 384 GCN shader version found in the "other" A12. As a quick side-note, Lenovo seems to be one of the few "built to last" brands, I still have an old i3-3110m laptop from like 2012 and it still runs like a champ despite my heavy heavy use (usually had it on 10-14 hours a day) and accidentally dropping it a few times. I've really grown to like this brand over the years (trust).UPDATE 2: 12/11/2017 - It seems to handle the new "Antorus the Burning Throne" raid just fine (with lowered settings, of course), frame-rates are comparable to Tomb of Sargeras from what I saw. I did a few Antorus LFRs last week between my various alts and didn't have any issues, A12-9720P is definitely a solid chip for the price. By the way, coming up on 4 months of regular use and still running great. Like I said the only real noticeable issue is the relatively slow 5400 RPM hard drive, which makes loading in take a little longer, but that's about it.I'll chime in here for my fellow WoW players, recently picked up this VERY solid machine over at Best Buy. One day while randomly browsing their site, I noticed the price suddenly dropped to $320 out of nowhere. Recognizing the bargain, I went and bought it same day.Anyways, it plays WoW: Legion just fine on lowered settings. Since it's Labor day weekend and I've been bored, I've really put in some hours and "put it through it's paces" the last few days. Here's some rough averages of performance at the stock resolution (1366 x 768):15-45 fps... in "new" Dalaran45-80 fps... just flying around Broken Isles/open world35-50 fps... typical average while doing WQ's14-23 fps... in "high clutter" scenarios, heavy AoE, lots of players/mobs on screen, etc25-50 fps... in most Bg's, a little lower during "high clutter" encounters obviously (ex. in AV/IoC matches)17-25 fps... typical LFR boss or raid scenario25-55 fps... typical 5-man dungeonThe only real "cons" I can think of:- runs a little hot, I ran HWMonitor in the background during my WoW sessions and the CPU did get up to around 65-67C at times, although it MOSTLY hovers around 56-60C from what I've seen (mostly playing WoW, I can't speak for other games)- USB ports are located on the left side of the machine, just a minor inconvenience (no biggie)- still uses the older/slower 5400 RPM hard drive, again not a big deal for the low priceFor only $320 I'm very satisfied with my purchase, this machine is a great value in the sub-$400 laptop segment. Most laptops in this price segment can't play games at all, or if they do play games it's a slide-show (ex. Intel graphics).
I've really enjoyed this product and would've given it a higher rating if it wasn't for a few problems.First, the battery is rather low, having around only 2 hours of active usage. Secondly, the charger is short, which is a annoying combination with the low battery. And lastly, my biggest problem is that it tends to restart from time to time for no reason when you use it for longer periods of time. But the sound system is amazing. It loads at a good speed, and it works fine besides my problems.
I'd been looking for a half way decent laptop for under $500 that I could use in my hotel room while I travel for work. I ordered a Western Digital 512GB SSD from Newegg the same day I ordered this laptop and upgaded the main hard drive with this and did a clean install of Windows 10 then downloaded and installed the drivers for this unit from the Lenovo website. I'd read reviews mentioning the factory install of Windows wasn't the greatest and had issues so I chose to upgrade main drive and start fresh right off the bat. Since I had no need for an optical drive, I bought a hard drive caddy for the optical bay so the factory 1TB hard drive is now a storage drive. My next upgrade will be to add more RAM but as it is now this is a great laptop so far.After traveling with this laptop for a little over a month it has been a great machine. It's not very heavy and it doesn't take up too much space in my backpack. The build quality seems pretty good and the keyboard is decent. I use it for web browsing, listening to music, and the occasional gaming. So far it runs SWTOR on medium-high. the Bioshock series on high, and Left4Dead2 on high without an issue. I haven't had the chance to try much past that but for what I do play it works perfect, especially when combined with a Logitech M510 wireless mouse.Pros:Good performance, especially after SSD upgradeEasy to upgrade - the bottom of the laptop is a single piece so once that's off everything is accessibleLightweight for its size - It's no Macbook Air but compared to my old Asus UL50 this thing is much lighter and makes it great for travelSpeakers - They won't blow you away but I've heard worseTouchpad - Responsive and solid. The single piece design that manufacturers are going to is hit and miss. Some are terrible, others are great. This one seems to be pretty good so far. It's not so sensitive that the cursor jumps while typing too which is great.Bluetooth - I use my Bluetooth headphones or speaker in my hotel room so the fewer cords on the desk the betterCons:Screen - My biggest gripe is the screen and its limited viewing angle but that seems to be the norm with these units.Internal battery - Not a deal breaker for me but as the unit ages and the battery starts to go, it is built-in so the laptop would have to be disassembled to replace it.Speaker location - I've got mixed feelings about this. They're on the bottom-front of the laptop which keeps the clutter down on the palmrest area, but if the unit is used on the users lap they become muffled. They sound better when the laptop is on a hard surface such as a table or desk which is nice when I'm not using my Bluetooth headphones or speaker on it.
After the screen on my HP laptop died I bought the exact same laptop. I was that happy with it. After a few years that screen died and then the keyboard died. No more HP laptops for me. Would love to have a Thinkpad, but that's to much $$$ for the likes of me.This Lenovo Ideapad meets my needs perfectly. I'm use to Windows 7 so there's been a little bit of a learning curve when it comes to doing things and finding stuff, but that was to be expected. I'm not a gamer and I wouldn't recommend it for a high end MMORPG but obviously that's not what I bought it for. I browse, shop, email, occasionally stream a movie, create documents and spread sheets. I also run the PLEX media server on this guy and have no issues using the PLEX app on my Fire Stick TV to pull movies stored on my laptop to watch on my TV. More than enough machine for me.The only issue I've had is printing. Sometimes it's unable to send printouts to the printer. Everything is setup correctly and the printer receives tests fine, but out of the blue it suddenly can't print from anything. I can still send a printer test fine. Network is fine. Default printer has current drivers and is fine. Trouble shooter can find no issues. I fix the issue by shutting down, powering off and rebooting. I suspect this is a Windows 10 issue so I didn't remove a star. Never had the issue with Windows 7.I installed the free for everyone LibreOffice rather than trialing the expensive Microsoft Office. I've used it for years and it more than meets my needs. There's not much bloatware. Some low end games and Microsoft stuff - mail, messaging, maps and such - that I don't use and uninstalled. I've been a Firefox fan for years, but I'm trying to give Microsoft Edge a chance. Final decision here will probably be based on available add-ons.I notice a lot of reviews complaining about updates taking so long. Truthfully, mine didn't seem to take that long. Besides, how is that the laptops fault? Windows needs to be immediately updated for any PC you buy and then continue to get updates periodically after that. That first update is always a big one. I live out in a rural area and on a good day my network download speed is a whopping 6MB. That is not a typo. I have no problem getting updates done or streaming movies. That said, if I'm doing some kind of big download then other things I'm doing do tend to slow down, but remember - 6MB bandwidth plus three of us in my home are using the internet at the same time. I also make sure nothing updates automatically. That includes all applications and Windows 10. Nothing more irritating than trying to do something and then some automatic update starts in the background and slows everything down or even makes your laptop seem to lock up. I just manually check for and start updates when I find it convenient to do so. I can but don't schedule auto updates to happen in the wee hours. Neither do I allow anything to send usage statistics or any other information up to its creators. Waste of bandwidth and computer resources. Something else I've noticed. Don't think I'm crazy. I don't know what it's doing, but if I leave my browser open to Amazon then my laptop - any laptop I've had - seems to run slower over time. I tended to leave it for days on end until I figured out what was going on. I resolved this by just not leaving my browser open on Amazon or at all for that matter.Sometimes products have defects. It happens. When I bought my brand new Jeep ten years ago the electronic sway bar disconnects didn't work. How did I feel spending over thirty grand (all the bells and whistles) and it didn't work right? It took three frustrating trips to the dealer to get it fixed. On my third trip I made them replace the whole system. Fixed. I still drive that Jeep today. I like this laptop. It works great for me. I can easily recommend it for the casual user. I'll resolve that minor printing issue. Just know the specifications, know what you're buying here, know what you plan on using it for, have realistic expectations and you'll be happy.
Laptop came defective. It ran slow and glitchy on the first day, the battery drained itself only after about an hour and a half, and then it couldnât even install a basic program like iTunes. After a few hours of troubleshooting whatâs wrong with the laptop, I found a corrupted directory in the system. To make matters worse, it just kept giving me more and more problems: it shut down randomly and got stuck on the âgetting readyâ?Lenovo splash screen, and when it finally got unstuck it took over an hour to boot back up! This all happened the first day out of the box, and itâs giving me a headache. So needless to say, itâs being returned.
Received the first one as a gift. The outer box came in severely damaged, the inner box (the actual laptop box) also had damage. I pulled it out, the unit itself didn't have any damage. Plugged it in so it could charge, after several hours, it still wouldn't power on. I returned it, which was a mess all in itself because it was a GIFT to me.With the credit from the return, I purchased another one of the same thing. The first one should have been my warning. I have had this since October, and in less than two months, and DEFINITELY outside of the return /exchange window, the new one has stopped working as well.1) I will never buy a laptop that I can't have in my hands immediately...no more online laptop purchases, and 2) I will NEVER purchase this brand ever again. Two bricked laptops in less than two months makes me beyond unhappy.
After reading reviews, I realized I paid way more..but I guess I still got a good deal.Cons- Large bezels & you have to upgrade the hard drive to SSD if you want a quicker laptop. (Did that the first day)Pros- It has low cons and runs my CAD programs really well
For a budget priced laptop you get a lot of bang for the buck. It wasn't loaded with tons of bloatware, either, which is a refreshing change. It's a Christmas gift so I opened it to configure it but hasn't been used on a daily basis yet. However, unless something unexpected happens it's a solid 5 stars for value (price to configuration).
Out of the box it is a dumpster fire it has 100s of start up tasks that render decent hardware useless. Prepare for a week of uninstalling, restarting, cleaning before you can load your first real program. Tech Support at Lenovo wont help you, then you have to start all over again with Bill Gates. Start up times are running over 10 to 20 min after 8 hours of updating Windows 10. WHAT A NIGHTMARE!!!!
I'm really impressed with this laptop, I got just as what was describe in the description.The built quality is so amazing, love the feel of the keyboard, wonderful display quality and resolution and most of all it runs smooth. However one of the downside about this laptop is that the battery life is not the best but for the price of this item it's worth buying it if you're on a budget! There's also other better versions of this laptop.
Does what I need it to do. Fast enough. Just web browsing, watching movies and stuff, and word processing. Don't run much stuff on it other than basic office software. Does the job for a cheap laptop. Graphics are pretty good, but I am not a gamer.
I know we all don't like to read negative reviews because we want this product to be the "one" after hours of comparing and contrasting but based on our experience with this laptop, I must give it a ONE star. Usually I don't write reviews but this is extremely disappointing because I always saw Lenovo as a budget friendly quality product. We bought this laptop for simple tasks such as browsing for products on the web and create basic excel sheets. It did not happen without any frustration. It took forever for the laptop to operate. We were actually deciding between this Lenovo and the Acer Aspire but decided on this one due to the 8GB of RAM. It was a bad decision purchasing this laptop because the computer would freeze as if it was a 5 year old laptop. Websites took MINUTES to load completely and the same goes for opening any application.I do use a Lenovo tower at home and it is magnificent, I wish I can say the same about this Laptop.
This is a nice computer. The processor is fairly fact and the set up was very easy. The only issue with the laptop is that the battery life could be better. Using it for normal browsing you get approximately 4 hours this is below the 5 hours average as stated by the Website.
For the price this is a really well equipped laptop. It is not technically a gaming laptop but it has handled several games very well such as Fallout NV and Crysis 3. It boots in a respectable amount of time and runs programs without much delay if any. If youâre wanting a laptop for word processing, web surfing, movies and occasional gaming, this truly is the best bang for your buck.Cons: Battery life is less than stellar but you can still get about 4 hours of use before worrying about finding an outlet.Screen washes out unless you are in front of it. This could also be a pro since it acts as a type of privacy screen.
I went from using an HP to this computer and this one is better by leaps and bounds! It's much faster it doesn't crash. I had no issues with start ups. It didn't come with Chrome but Chrome was super easy to download. I work from home so my laptop is very important and I am on it 12-14 hours a day, this is by far the best laptop I have owned, and it was a great price. I think the people with negative review either got a faulty product or are just way to picky. This product is great for both my business and personal needs!
Very happy with this purchase! Definitely a solid laptop for a very fair price. I'm able to run tons of programs for general professional tasks like office apps and emails at once with out any slowdown and works seamlessly. Also as far as running games - it can definitely run most Xbox 360/PS3 era games quite well. I've been playing GTA IV and Fallout 3 connected on my TV and it looks great. But any games with a lot going on and intense graphics have some slowdown, Sonic Generations for example. I wouldn't bother trying to run something like The Witcher 3 or PUBG on this though.
The laptop took a bit to turn on, but once it did it worked perfectly. It's a bit loud but the noise is manageable. The laptop is fast and I don't have any concerns at the moment. It looks great for the price you pay for it. The full keypad on the side is pretty awesome.
I was looking for something cheap but of value for someone. I was very skeptical about the laptop. When I get it, it run very slow, like really slow, snail slow. You get the idea. So I decided to open the bottom and swapped the HDD for an SSD that cost me 60 bucks. This thing becomes as fast as my $1000 laptop. I highly recommend you change the HDD for an SSD or you'll be pulling your hair ( I'm getting bald BTW)
Laptop came with a myriad of issues.TrackPad felt and looked loose. An absurd amount of pressure was needed for the left click to register.Overall performance was lacking especially for a machine with these specs (start up time >4 minutes, opening browser > 30 seconds, opening Word >1 minute, YouTube videos buffered forever even on multiple reliable WiFi connections).After troubleshooting, the following issues were found:1. When running Lenovo Vantage Health & Support hardware scan, the laptop would freeze, restart itself without warning and show the blue screen of death with the following error message: DRIVER POWER STATE FAILURE2.Started the laptop in safe mode, uninstalled and corrected the faulty drivers (Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 Wireless Network Adapter, Generic PnP monitor, System Interface Foundation Device) yet the issues still lingered.3. Windows updates would not install. Running the Windows Reapir Tool did not resolve the issue. PC reset did not fix it as well.Pretty freaking annoying; not what I expected at all.
I bought two of this as gifts. Recipients very happy with them and their performance (they are graphic designers).
I gave this laptop a shot after reading mixed reviews. I have been searching for a budget laptop under $500 for quite a while now. We use Lenovo machines at work and have enjoyed using them so I kept Lenovo in mind while shopping. I realize there is a difference between consumer and business computers. I was impressed with the quality of products and customer service from the business perspective that I thought I could expect a similar experience with a consumer model. Boy was I wrong.Out of the box the display lid was very loose. It wobbled back and forth while I was typing. The fans were loud as other reviewers have stated. The hard drive was also noisy, and occasionally made a clicking sound. I understand mechanical hard drives will make noise, but I have been around these type of hard drives long enough to know that when it starts clicking it will fail at some point very soon. The plastic was cheap and flimsy, probably not going to last past the warranty expiration.I have been using budget laptops for 10+ years, and I have never been so disgusted in the quality of the machines available today. I understand compromises are made to keep machines affordable at the budget level. I can deal with a low quality, non hd TN display, or a mechanical hard drive, or even a plastic build (solid build quality, not hollow plastic).These large companies need to stop cutting corners on entry level consumer products. I have had a similar experience with HP, Asus, & Acer. For a machine that is nearly $400 in 2018, this is unacceptable. My coworkers were even shocked to hear about my experience with a Lenovo product. I cannot recommend this product to anyone.
Terrific laptop. An an Apple fan, I was happily surprised how easy it was to navigate this device. And it is powerful and fast. We have recommended it to our friends who are looking for an upgrade, as we were, at an extremely good price. And Lenovo help desk was superb in answering any questions or concerns we had. Buy it!
Sort of a pita to replace the hard disk with ssd, but other than that this baby is nice and fast. 7th gen apu is great for us in the middle of the bell curve. If you are going to install ssd, then you will need to buy a set of the plastic laptop pry tools so you don't damage anything - they're pretty cheap though.
As stated in other reviews initial updates took unbelievably long to finish now so far so good I personally hate win 10 but the computer seems good for the money spent
I love. love this Laptop. I have been looking for a very long time for one that is suitable for my needs and also price point is the key. Purchased in US dollars and it was still cheaper to purchase through Amazon US than Amazon Canada after the exchange rate. . I saved over $300.00 dollars purchasing through Amazon US. To purchase at other stores here in Canada it is over $800.00 plus taxes. The only problem I am having with the laptop is when I view videos on Facebook and You Tube I keep getting a thick green vertical line. I have searched Google but finding nothing to help me get rid of the issue. If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated.
Overall I liked everything about this computer. My first Lenovo purchase. I would purchase this again. One negative statement. Since purchase, I did have an accident with the adapter power cord. I contacted Amazon and manufacturer and to date have still not received what is the proper code so I can send and repurchase a replacement adapter. I am still working on this issue. Hoping someone will contact me. I do not need a website with many selections. I need guidance in choosing the exact adapter. Thank you.
An excellent laptop for the price, runs well, decent for a lot of different things like a little gaming and word processing. Decent graphics, decent storage, sleek design and not too heavy to carry around for a while.Battery runs down a little fast but then, most laptops do. Works just as well on low battery though and is good about not losing anything you had in progress when it does die.
absolutely amazing. can use it for school and with the right programs can run most games so if you're researching what computer is good for gaming and school work at a low price this is definitely the laptop for it. I did tons of research before buying it and this one has a great graphics card as well as plenty of storage.
Great computer but my hard disk came defective(it was consuming a lot of the memory with the computer empty and it was making a "click" noise and whatever Lenovo was charging me for shipping the product back(around 40 dollars0, for 52, I got a new hard drive and asked my computer technician to change it for meNow it's perfect!!!
A very pleasant surprise. Seems quite snappy and a very good value for the money.
I like this laptop, no problems. But I just found this product on Lenovo's website direct for $339.00. Did I spend to much at $390? Maybe, but I like the convenience of Amazon.
This laptop straight out of the box will not work for most people as it has many problems and all related to Microsoft and not Lenovo the Laptop itself. You will need a Tech like my son to fix these problems. The Resources or CPU 85% RAM 30% HDD 100% out of the box on idle. After my son fixed it, Resources is CPU 0% Ram 22% HDD 0% on idleMicrosoft1) When first turning it on and completing the setup, Windows will want to do an update and then it get's stuck on this part. I let it run for 8 hours and it would not finish the download as the problem is with Microsoft Update Assistance. So I hard shut down the computer and performed a clean boot of Windows 10 from my USB flash drive and this fixed the update problem and it only took me about 20 minutes to complete the new install of Windows with almost all new updates. It only had about 6 updates to do but only took about 15 minutes to complete those.2) Then all drivers were installed and firmware's.3) Two more problems caused the HDD to max out at 100% is (Problem A) Windows Store kept downloading apps that I did not won't and I uninstalled a couple of times but kept redownloading. So I performed a registry tweak and fixed that problem. (Problem B) Windows Superfetch, this is a known problem that has been around for many years and most people can disable it but it prevents the computer from loading programs into memory making it faster at launching those programs. If I wait 1-2 minutes after Windows finishes booting up, Superfetch will return to normal. So I did not disable it.4) Windows Defender causes the HDD to max out at 100% so by installing a different Antivirus software fixes this problem as it will disable Windows Defender but you need an AV that isn't a resource hog too. Sophos, Malwarebytes, Comodo, Bitdefender, or Avast (random order) or all great products in protecting you and isn't a resource hog.LenovoThe structure itself seems to be good. I like how the hinges are made and hopefully they will not break like other laptops. I am surprised how light weight this laptop is. It does come with a side keypad and a CD/DVD drive which is what I wanted. The graphic card is very good and I can play games if I want to as long as it's not a high-end game. The Keyboard doesn't have backlight which I love because it causes a glare with my eyes and I can't see the keys. Huge Hard Drive which is overkill for myself as I use local and online backup storage. Lots of Ram at 8GB which I really like along with the AMD A12 processor at 2.7GHz with turbo to 3.4GHz. I am a fan of AMD verses Intel because they are cheaper but can still keep up with Intel. I didn't pay much for this laptop because it was on sale plus I used my rewards points but it was still a very good off-sale price for what it comes with.This is my first Lenovo laptop as I always bought HP in the past.
I would give zero stars if I could. I guess a quick search would have maybe shown that these have issues connecting to WiFi. Worked through all options with centurylink because lenovo is closed on saturdays. Simply the hardware itâs self doesnât recognize the WiFi unless there is a hard connection but this is a known issue and there doesnât seem to be anything being done. Had the computer 2 hours.
This computer is great. After all updates when we first received the computer. The games run fast on this computer. Very pleased with it.
I really like this laptop I got it to replace my nearly four year old 15" hp laptop which still runs really well but family uses it more, so I got this one for me. It's not a flagship or gaming laptop but it can hold its own I run my steam games on it some at high most at medium setting and have no problem, but when it comes to gaming if it can run the Sims 4 at ultra high setting it's a winner for me.
Since replacing her old laptop with this Lenovo I no longer hear my wife yelling in frustration. She is quite pleased with this one. She can enter grades online with ease now. A task that was risky at best with the previous laptop. I think this was a good buy for the money. Seems very stable, I have yet to see it lock up or crash. The keyboard is nicely arranged as well.
Had this for a few months now and it is a monster! My wife plays SIMS 4 with every expansion pack all the time and it handles it like a champ! Very quick, tons of storage, moderately thin and light, great battery life. Lenovo is a great brand period. Buy it!
so far so good. it is far faster than his old computer and meets his gaming needs (uses on-line sites for game-play).
What I like the most is the weight and look generally. What I dislike the most is the battery charge duration
Normally don't like to write negative reviews but I have had nothing but problems with this computer. Loved my older version but this one crashes on me all the time, is slow, loud, has no battery life, and I wish I had just returned it when I had the chance.
Bought for hubby who hates laptops. Hoped it would be faster than his old one, it's not.
Excellent computer! Wonderful screen and works perfectly for Sims 3 and 4. I do notice that it gets slow when you don't update Windows 10 exactly on time. Would recommend to everyone, and is excellent for the price!!
The item was left outside leaning against the front tire of my truck. Good thing there was no rain or snow and no one took it
Overall this is a good laptop. The boot up time is quite long with the mechanical HDD. I have swapped it with SSD and boot time is significantly improved. This is mainly used for Microsoft office and some light gaming and both performed well.
Great for my grand for homework and games
Laptop looks good. Not too heavy.But you get what you pay for. The processor struggles when more than 5 tabs are open in chrome and nothing else. I am trying to figure out the issue if there is any background processes going on.
Does not work as intended. Very Disappointed. HDMI display not showing through. I think it is defective. Cannot get in touch with seller to discuss
Its been a good computer for the price.
For those wonder why this laptop runs slow. Simply go serach "how to fix 100% disk usage" on youtube. After you fix Silly Win10 issue, this laptop runs fine.
Good value for the money.
Works Great
Hated the touch pad, very touchy, Horrible!
The computer itself is great but not straight out of the box.This is my 2nd laptop from Lenovo and it had all the same problems as the first one did. CPU running high, HDD staying at 100%. So when I got my 2nd laptop I plugged in my Win10 bootable flashdrive and performed a clean installing of Windows and then I installed all updates, BIOs, and drivers. I then installed my own antivirus software and that immediately fixed my HDD staying maxed out because it was due to Windows Defender. My only dislikes is that it uses Seagate HDD and Samsung memory chip. Every Seagate HDD that I've owned which is a lot has all failed and I hate all Samsung products because all have failed for me in laptops, tv's, and phones. Western Digital HDD is what I like and never had one fail. My other dislike is that I have to remove the complete back panel to gain access to the HDD or memory. I like it better when it has a small quick access panel for this. I only recommend this laptop to Tech's and not the average users due to Windows 10 problems.
This is the best computer you can get for this price!!! Ok so this computer has 8 GB of RAM and 1Tb of storage to start off, and that it amazing to find anything like that under $800, but yes of course this computer has some minor problems, but the problems were intentionally because they make the battery total garbage, and no backlit keyboard. but those features were added so then people could get a good laptop for cheap. ive been playing video games on it, and its super smooth, even when i have multiple tabs open. I am able to play music, play videogames, plus have downloads going all at the same time and its still smooth. i love this laptop.
a gift
great I use it for movies.
Works great!
the computer runs terrible on battery, it lasts about 2 hrs and the screen is dull unless plugged in
kinda loud, a little heavy to carry with - overall works well
Everything is good but I donât believe that the rams is 8gb itâs slow as ð¤¬really
Great product for a great price. I couldn't find a better deal for our needs -- web browsing, word processing, pagination software, spreadsheet work. Product arrived factory sealed.
Computer shuts down and restarts for no reason. Trying to determine why.
Slow. Glitchy. Returned.
This is the worst sales experience that I have ever had in my whole life. I received a computer that I couldn't ever get to start. Had to send it back the same day the order was delivered.
the best laptop I ever use, despite the battery drains in 2 hours, it's a very powerful laptop, recommend it
Iâve this laptop less than a year and the battery life sucks. After charging, I take it off the charger and I have an hour of use before itâs dead again.
Amazing performance for the price, it tend to get hot quickly with light gaming but it can be improved with cooling pad.
The computer worked great. Until it will no longer read that there is a hard drive. And we cannot find a place to contact anyone about it
Happy with the price to power trade off, no issues week one thus far.
My daughter loves it gave it to her for Christmas
Great starter laptop. Not the fastest computer on the market but it gets the job done.
Product lasted 4 months keyboard quit working ! Buyer Beware!
its a great laptop for the price
Not very fast and most annoying the sound of hard disk
Great laptop for the price. My wife is loving this.
Can't do anything. Slow, slow, slow. DO NOT BUY!
Pros:cost effectivebig screenno bloat waregood ram,processor,overall configurationcons:less batterynot a very bright screensound seems to be ok and one may not like front facing speakers below the keyboardbit noisy and fan is situated at the bottom.long run review will be posted after few weeks
They love them but confused havenât gotten warranty info yet
Returned unopened.
Nice sleek look
The charger is not workinG!
Laptop works great, bought as a gift for my Brother in law. Here is the deal, I installed a Samsung 850 Pro inside the computer before I gave it to him so it is super fast. You will be hard pressed to find any AMD processors with SSDs preinstalled until Ryzen mobile chips become more popular. I chose this laptop because it gave the best gaming and photoshop performance for the price and It was a high end AMD processor and Graphics unit.
Its pretty, and it arrived quick. Thats it. Its always updating or getting windows ready. Its almost a good computer....but its slow. As you can see in the pic, its doing it now. I haven't even used it in 2 days, and it already updated. Also when I first got it out of the box it updated for 3.5 hours until we finally turned it off and back on.
Excellent laptop for reasonable price
Broke in like a week
Very Very Good
Good item
Excellent computer!! For playing Minecraft or games!! A12 is a good GPU
I would have given 5 stars, but the battery is TERRIBLE! It last at the most 2 hours! Everything else is great. I dinât know if it is too late to return it?
Great laptop for budget gaming. Works well, turns on fairly quickly. I would recommend disabling windows updates, getting a different antivirus and disabling windows defender. Also very important go to your battery settings and set maximum processor speed to 85%.This will make sure the laptop doesn't get hot and throttle itself (slow down). It also saves a bit of battery.After all this, it plays fortnite at 1366Ã768 on a mix of Med-High settings at a locked 30fps. Which isnt bad for a laptop in this price range. Overall, impressed with it. Works great after changing those things, would lag before.
Slow, and I mean SLOW out of the box. It took forever just to set up the computer, and when I did the computer acted like it was 5 years old with a full hard drive. It took forever to open up any program, froze when I tried to search for a program, took minutes to shut down and restart, etc. After a google search this is apparently common for this specific Lenovo computer. I was about ready to return it, but I have a basic reset a try. That didn't work (still slow clunky), so in one final attempt I did a full reset and with a deep erase of all data on the computer, and that finally worked! It seems to be acting fine for the most part now.This computer really deserves one stall as there is no reason it should have worked that way out of the box and passed any sort of QC, but its saving grace is that with a lot of work to get it set up correctly it is actually a decent computer with great specs. Thinking that with a SSD someday it will actually be pretty snappy.
I purchase this unit on 27 August 2017 received it on the 6 September 2017 as described, however there are a few issues:1. The battery life is poor just around 2 hrs with normal use2. Treading on the screws to the bottom of the laptop is wore and the screws are falling out.3. On simple task like internet browsing and casual gaming (Asphalt 8) the unit lags and sticksIt is quite unfortunate as this unit was my first purchase in the AMD, Lenovo line up and most like my last
Really marginal customer service. The computer comes loaded with windows 10. There seems to be a problem with windows indexing so I am getting marginal results when searching through my emails. The indexing function is not working in the control panel and when I called Lenovo they told me its not their problem its windows even though they were the ones who included it with the computer. They wanted to charge me $69 dollars to fix the problem.The other thing is the web cam picture is very poor quality. I wouldn't recommend this lap top.
Hard Drive failed after a month and a half. Lenovo support Suuuuuuucks. Good laptop though, after I replaced the HD.
So far I love it. I play World of Warcraft and it handles it great. I would totally recommend this laptop to anyone.
Great laptop for the price!
Could not be happier.
VERY GOOD PRODUCT. IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND DEFINATLY STACKS UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS. AFTER DOING A LENGTHY DETAIL AND INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS TO BUY A LAPTOP ONLINE, I CAME TO THE CONLCUSION THAT THIS WAS THE BEST ONE TO GET FOR THE PRICE.NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT OTHER THAT THE CASING FEELS MORE ON THE PLASTIC SIDE THAN METAL.
My parents like this laptop
Not sure about the negative comments on this computer I got this for $300.00 and I believe it is well worth the price It came with a 1tb drive and 8gb of ram ( up gradable to 16gb ) and works a treat. It runs Fallout 4 reasonable well and runs Metro 2033 on high settings just fine. No it's not a gaming beast but for 300 it's a steal. Well satisfied customer here. Very fast shipping. Sorry a few of you had lemons.Cons. None as yet.
Great laptop for the price! I would definitely purchase this again!
Love the laptop started off slow but I'm satisfied with it.
Since day 1 around 5pm of receiving the laptop, we were not able hook the computer onto the internet. Then, my son created a password that neither of us were able to use because each time we typed it in, we were not able to log in to the computer. After speaking to Lenovo customer service, they advised us to do a factory reset which took all night long. By morning, we were able to log in, but not able to tap into wifi. I called customer service. Since everything else in our house is tapped into wifi except for this laptop, and we did the factory reset, the 2nd customer service person advised to send the laptop to on of their service centers. However, this rep would not compensate for shipping. This person said our computer was defective yet we had to pay for shipping it to a service center, even if the laptop is covered under warranty. We haven't even had it for a day. We are returning it at no expense to us and buying a new laptop under a different brand that doesn't charge us to ship or fix something defective from the beginning.
is perfect, aesthetically beautiful, I recommend it.
Showed up on time. Maybe even a day early. Seems like a nice laptop. We bought it for my mom as a Christmas present. She's very happy with it.
Internet is so slow. Opening folders is really slow...
its awesome in looks
Horrible: slow, screen freezes, bad graphics. Bought for my daughter so she could do iready not working.
It did not work had to return it.
Do not buy this. I must have received a lemon because the reviews were pretty good but this computer is horrible. Seemed okay at first, pretty slow but that was to be expected at the price point. Well after just a couple of months and not storing much on it at all, it takes an hour for it to load up and to complete a simple task. I can't get anything done with this and it was the a waste of money. I knew that I should have paid a little more to get a quality laptop but I got duped by the reviews so hopefully I can save some of you all the trouble. Also, I contacted customer support to try to resolve the issue before I wrote a bad review but no one ever answered me. Was just outside the return window or I would have definitely sent it back.
Great laptop for the price.. The wife loves it
Pretty quick processor but screen is very low quality. Plastic body feels cheap. Sending mine back.
About this product: 3 star 1Âº if you think to use to play at would be the best choice, it is poor in usb only 2 I had to buy a usb hub. second ... very poor image is not so neat is just a notebook to use in light work but could play the games: FIFA 16, PES16 - h1z1 low mode and medium - GT5 its a little slow - Naruto storme 3 - 4 good to play - Pugb very low graphics. But if you need a pc just to study its good I used software like: Photoshop, office, Illustrator and corel its work good ... But you if you want good image you need to connect this laptop with other monitor coz the display its very bad. Other thing this laptop it just has 1 slot to memory if you want to upgrade you need to but a ram with 16.
I bought it a month ago and it has begun freezing, glitching, and isn't even functional at this point. I tried to trust all the good reviews but I for sure got a bad product. It's worse than the laptop I was replacing.
After researching as much as this technically illiterate person could about the cheapest but best laptop. This is a nice laptop for the money but I was a little disappointed in the speed of internet browsing.
Bought it as a combined birthday and Christmas gift for my son to use for school. Two months later it doesn't work. Hoping the extra warranty I bought with it replaces it. If I get goofed over on it that will be the last time I buy anything from Amazon!!!
NO RECOMENDABLE.
loud-loud-loud!!!We have had use this laptop for 15 minutes to understand that it needed to be given back.
Update: If I could leave ZERO stars, I would. This is a piece of CRAP! 2 months later and it no longer recognizes the SD card from my camera. Throwing this piece of sh*t in the trash and getting a different one from a reliable company. The S-L-O-W-E-S-T computer ever, if I could leave ZERO stars, I would. I purchased this laptop as a backup for my desktop of 4 years that had been acting up. I made the mistake of getting rid of the original packaging the second day because at first, it seemed like a great laptop. The third day of use, I noticed that it was slow loading websites or when I was clicking from one item to another. The fourth day, I had to do a hard shut down because the computer locked up and even pressing control/alt/delete did absolutely nothing. When I restarted the computer after the hard shut down, it took TWO HOURS to load updates and continued to operate in slow mode. I have had this laptop for 5 weeks now and I've had to do another 2 hard shutdowns due to it locking up and now, it does this scrolling on it's own thing where the screen kind of bounces around. Really wishing I would have spent a little more for a quality machine because right now I feel like I tossed away $375.00.
For the price I think it's one of the more powerful laptop you can buy. The A12 9720 is definitely comparable to the Intel i5 in terms of processing power. However, the AMD Radeon R7 built into this laptop beats all i5 laptops out there. The R7 is a very capable graphics chip. Able to handle pretty high resolution graphics without lagging and slowing down the computer. Once the R7 gets updated to the latest drivers, I noticed I am able to set my screen resolution to 1080 instead of the standard 768. I am not a gamer but some reviewers here have tested it on some pretty high resolution intensive games and are happy about it. That's really good testimony to the R7. With 8 Gb of RAM it is more than capable of handling multiple open windows and browser tabs. A terabyte of disk storage is more than enough to save all your data. The entire laptop is plastic, for the price range I can't complain. The battery is non-removable. It is also very slim. Comes with a USB-C which is great. It allows charging of devices without even turning on your laptop. Overall construction of the laptop is OK.What I don't like about it - which is why I removed a star - the fan is extremely noisy. The disk is also noisy. I also prefer laptops to have removable batteries. And to all potential buyers ... updating the laptop to Windows 10 build 1709 takes a while. So this has nothing to do with Lenovo. Be patient while it updates; it's necessary.Overall, if you do not want to spend more than $400 on a reasonably fast and powerful laptop, anything with the AMD A12 9720 with the Radeon R7 GPU is a great buy at $300+. This Lenovo definitely fits the bill.
The only thing this laptop needs is a solid state hard-drive (SSD) and you're good to go. Boots up within 15 seconds. Lenovo will likely comment that swapping out the HD will void your warranty but consider this. You can just as easily re-install the original HD which has Windows and all of their bloatware pre-installed. Then just ship it back for any warranty issues. There is no security sticker over the screw or compartment that holds the HD and installing it takes 5 minutes. Lenovo just wants you to spend an arm and a leg using their techs to do upgrades. Don't fall for that garbage. Watch a Youtube vid if you need to and do it yourself.
Everyone that's complaining of how slow it is needs to upgrade to an SSD. I've upgraded my previous laptops and desktops with SSD's but they have never been this dramatic of a overall speed increase. This machine is lightning with one. it's real easy to upgrade just search google and youtube. The included hard drive is the slowest 5400 rpm drive you can find, it's junk. Windows now boots in under 8 seconds. Very happy with the performance after upgrading to a relatively cheap PNY SSD. The A12 9720p is snappy and 8GB of ram is a nice amount for windows 10. Do yourself a favor and upgrade to an SSD immediately with the purchase of this one or you'll hate it like some other review's i've seen.
I purchased this laptop last night from best buy, It was on sale for 309$ At this price point you can get a laptop that is touch screen but lacks good battery life or performance, You can get a laptop with bad performance and decent battery life or you can get this. Considering the price point this laptop is quit powerful. Overall the speakers don't sound terrible but they are down firing and don't get super loud, the display isn't the brightest but it is definitely not dim by any means. The colors on the display are not the best but certainly okay for the price point. when folded open the screen doesn't wobble around and overall the build quality is nice. AGAIN considering the price point. The keyboard definitely isn't the worst I've used. Overall I would recommend this laptop if you're a college student like me or if you are wanting a bigger laptop and on a budget. Overall the laptop doesn't get crazy loud under load. IF BATTERY LIFE IS A MAJOR CONCERN this might be an issue for you. While listening to music with the volume around 75% surfing the web this laptop only lasted around 3.5 hrs, battery saver is turned on about 85%. Battery life isn't a major concern for me because im usually around an outlet. overall this laptop is worth the price considering the pros and cons. the biggest con is the battery life.
I have noticed how slow the laptop may seem to be, but consider windows 10 is a big OS compared to the earlier versions. Also Hard Drives is slower than Solid State Drives. But is this bad? Not necessarily. You have enough power to game and do light video editing. This is not a workstation gaming laptop costing over $2,000. Tech guys has always been iffy on AMD APUs but after I figure out how to keep software up-to-date, it works wonderful. For me I love this purchase and it works for me. Eventually I might add in an ssd and expand to 16 gb of ram but this is enough for me.So my final verdict is for someone on a budget, this is perfect for light gaming and video editing. For better than this, either spend more for upgrades of this laptop, or go for something dedicated to 24/7 heavy use. Thank you Lenovo and AMD. I am impressed for what I got.Update November 29, 2017: My laptop froze and I know why. Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge was acting wonky. So a heads up. Download current AMD software and CCleaner or a better Cleaner. After CCleaner removes temp files from Microsoft Edge, one day of browsing internet and 1 gigabyte of hard drive space was Microsoft Edge ONLY. So lesson learned, always clean your PC the moment it gets slow. Looking at it, Microsoft Edge and Windows 10 is POWER HUNGRY. I hope Windows 10 improves better in the near future.
Overall a great, fast computer, especially for the price! I've only had it for a week, but I've loaded games, music (about 5,500 songs), and my photos/docs. It is still working fast and it's not glitchy. One thing that I do not like about it is the screen brightness when it's not plugged in. I have it on 100% brightness when it's unplugged and it's equivalent to around 50% brightness when it's plugged in. I get it's a good way to save battery, but I'd like to have the choice to have full brightness and deal with having my battery die faster. Other than that, I love it. And since I'm on this thing all day for work, maybe it's for the best that I don't have the full power brightness on my eyes all the time.Also, it looks really sleek and is so flat! And the finger pad is the perfect sensitivity and has the 2-finger scroll option which I love! It's a really great value and I would definitely recommend.
Overall a great laptop for the price. Runs well without any serious lag issues. Can run most low graphic games without issue.Only real complaints I have is the keyboard is not backlit, which is annoying when using it in lowlight. Second complaint is you cannot open laptop one handed. It is so light that you pick the whole thing up instead of only lifting screen.
I'm sure this computer would be fine for a non-technical person who only uses it for email. I know you get what you pay for with features and such, but this machine sounded a little bit like one of those awful leaf-blowers with intermittent revving if I did so much as open windows explorer. I'm not even sure if the HD vs SSD was the lowest common denominator, or if this machine was defective, but I was unimpressed.
Seeing it in physics is better than in photos, it really is very beautiful, when you turn it on you realize the power it has, the screen is very good size.One of the things I liked most was its full keyboard, with number keys on the right, the design allows you to have that keyboard without looking rustic.I recommend it...
I bought this laptop for my little brother and he loves it. It does take a while to set up because when you first turn it on it has to upgrade, but after that, it works great. The laptop is aesthetically pleasing, does not look cheap and it has good response time (meaning the time between performing an action and the computer completing it). So if you're looking for a laptop to get the job done at a resonable price this is it.
SUPER slow. If you were hoping to buy a product that comes basically ready to use right out of the box: don't buy this product. Plan to spend 2-3 waiting for it to 'update' and work slower than molasses while doing so. I've only had it 1 day and I'm already wishing I had shelled out the extra money and bought a better brand/model.
I've had this for one month. The fan is CONSTANTLY running and driving me crazy. Several times it just turned off without warning. It is too slow to handle Netflix or Amazon video without the video lagging. I'm fed up. At most, I have a few tabs open in Google chrome, iTunes, and Word, but even just Google Chrome makes this computer overheat.
This is a great laptop for its price of $379.99. However it is even greater to buy it or $279.99- which I did at Best Buy on Black Friday of 2017. It's not a gaming laptop but it's a great laptop for its price and it can handle pretty powerful video games but not top most powerful modern (2017 and later) video games.Here are the great things about it for its price:1 TB storage space8 GB Ram memoryGreat graphics card for gaming- which is over 4 GB memory2.7 GHZ processorVery fast computerOther good things about this laptop:-It also has Windows 10 which I like- except for the start menu which I have switched to the Windows 7 version. Everything (in this Windows 10 software) is organized so well-It isn't heavy so it's easier to carry-The screen is bright-The keyboard is comfortable and has the comfortable, convenient and useful Numpad at the right-With its specs it can handle all games that are not too powerfulMy previous laptop cost a bit under $400 that I've bought in 2012 and didn't have all these pros. For $279.99 and even $379.99, but especially the former, this is much better laptop for its price- including adjusted for technological differences in 2012 and 2017.I really don't see any cons... except maybe a slightly weak battery. But I have dealt with it by using power/battery saver mode. On battery at that mode lasts over 3 hours (like nearly 4 hours) which is enough for me.About what kinds of video games it can run:It can't run Ni No Kuni 2 but it can run Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst and Tales of Zestiria on minimum specs. Naruto, or both of those games, require 1 GB/1024 MBs Dedicated Video RAM for Recommended run but this computer has only 512 MBs Dedicated Video RAM.
This laptop (bought from BB) has only 1 possible Ram Card expansion slot which has only 4 Gig. BB said the other 4 Gig is permanently soldered onto the motherboard. This laptop has a prettier--more finished appeal. But I don't recommend over the HP model for future RAM expansion.When I opened and looked at the Motherboard I could not see the soldered in RAM. When I checked VRAM, it was listed as 1.8 Gig (HP was the same). Also the battery is internal to the case and is not removable (created out of flat cellphone style batteries). HP battery is removable. Keyboard buttons seemed more refined but this seems like a disposable laptop---not cool at $400.00.
slowest,most worthless piece of junk I have ever over paid for in my life. Will be smashing it with a sledgehammer tomorrow and replacing with any other laptop except one made by Lenovo.
Good computer for the price. Make sure you do all the software updates and install CC Cleaner. It ran slow at times but once the updates were installed it seemed to speed up.
Pasaron los dÃ­as y aÃºn espero que realicen el envÃ­o.
Great so far, a week and and it's working perfectly
It was more than I expected. Great for homework and entertainment. Would recommend to everyone.
I was hoping this one had lighted key board keys like my last one but other than that it is very good. I'm glad Lenovo fixed their wireless software. I had some issues getting rid of trial software I didn't want and replacing it with what i did want but that was resolved by Microsoft once I got an agent who recognized the issues. I am enjoying using it for my many computer chores.
Worked fine for exactly 2 months. Tonight I set it down for a few minutes, I come back and it won't turn on! Unfortunately I didn't buy the insurance.
Very nice laptop. Packaged well, received on time and it was just as described.
Garbage garbage garbage. uses 100% of CPU with no programs running right out of the box. Crashes a couple of times a day. A word document plus internet browser is too much for it. DO NOT BUY LENOVO. It is absolute crap.
its fine, but too slow....
Worst computer I've ever used. Garbage. Please do not buy this. Distorts images, can't handle a simple Youtube video, slow from the get go, loud, looks cheap, short wire for the charger- I had to use it for class and thought I could deal with it, so I threw the box out prematurely. I would sell my soul to get rid of this thing and never have to touch it again.
I am happy with this purchase.
Great product,
very happy
Great laptop especially for the price. Its just what I needed for now.
This is a great laptop
Bought it for my wife. Very nice computer.
Real good!
The laptop came in pegging the CPU and disk usage at 100% all the time. I had to remove McAfee, everything Lenovo, and every other crappy utility they added to it. Once all that stuff was gone I was finally able to install the application I bought this for. I'm just using it to run my golf simulator and so far so good for that but I would not recommend this for every day use.
This laptop is the absolute worst Amazon purchase Iâve ever made. It took several hours to run the program set-up process, the touchpad is not response at all, downloading files takes an extremely long time, and it has frozen about four times since I started using it about an hour ago. Also, battery life is terrible! Iâve used it for some internet browsing and and excel work and the battery percentage has gone from 100% to 82% over the course an hour. I cannot believe that Lenovo makes such a poorly crafted product. I would not recommend this product even if it meant you had to use grid paper to perform calculations and an ancient typewriter to type. Big time thumbs down.
UffDa!Not very good
its perfect and everything works correctly, amazed at the price and it looks and works like a new laptop
Laptop when powered on, went into a endless beeping loop (4 beeps) - may indicate bad memory RAM. Had to return the unit. Will try to get a replacement.After working with a tech from the supplier company SJ COMPUTERS LLC, I was going to get a replacement. He recommended trying a couple more things to see if it would fix the problem. The one that worked was to remove the RAM, clean it and then reinstall. That fix the problem and the laptop now runs great. It's a great laptop for the price.
Definitely worth buying if you need an affordable laptop thatâll work for all of your needs.
Looks and functions like brand new. If the ad hadnât said refurbished I would not have known the difference
Terrible piece of crap laptop. The description said it had an RJ-45 jack and that was the only reason I bought it. Unfortunately the description was a lie. Aside from that, keep in mind it has less drive space than your average microSD card lol.
Nice laptop!
Since it is refurbished, I'm assuming the issue before was the keyboard. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I have to restart it, which takes about 5 minutes, otherwise I like it. Runs great, good screen size and sleek.
Not what was expected at first. The laptop wouldn't charge. Contacted the seller and was sent a replacement charger. Works perfect now.
I bought this strictly for HP Tuners and TunerStudio for Megasquirt. It works very well.
Very very nice! Fast shipping, well packaged, great laptop for the price, this is simply amazing! Thank you!
it doesn't work as well as would like. VERY slow, and I had to buy a mouse because the pad didn't function well at all.
Keyboard doesnât work.
Works great. Light weight and very portable. Small charger is also light weight. It's a must have.
This was easy to set up!
had to return it
I liked it
*Update March 17, 2017*Having used the Samsung Chromebook Plus every day since I got it, and mostly ignoring my MacBook Pro with 15" Retina Display, I believe that the Plus is the first real "iPad killer" I've come across. By that I mean, it fulfills the promise to replace a laptop for almost all uses while addressing the shortcomings of tablets. The keyboard is built in, there is a track pad and touch screen with stylus, no separate case is required, and the rotating screen provides genuinely useful orientations. It's fast, battery life is good, charging is quick, the screen is fantastic, it can drive external displays, and it's reasonably light. The Chrome browser is first rate, and it can run thousands of apps! I've been using the Plus extensively at home and while traveling - for browsing, watching videos, taking handwritten notes (see update on LectureNotes below), email, photos, reading Kindle books, music, maps, games - you name it. The Plus and others like it are the portable do-it-all devices of the future.*Original Review and updates*I've had a few days to play with the Chromebook Plus and so far I love it! I've been looking to replace my Samsung Tab Pro 12.2" tablet (the Note Pro without a pen). The Chromebook Plus seemed perfect as it can be folded over to be a tablet, and can also be used like a regular laptop. Plus it runs Chrome and Android apps.Overall I really like it. It's size is just right, a bit heavier than the Tab / Note Pro and a bit squarer (see attached comparison pictures). The screen is really good and I only need to put it on 1/2 brightness. It's aspect ratio is 3:2 which is perfect for browsing and using as a tablet. The touchscreen works very well. I love that I don't need a special case to prop it up; the 360 degree hinge allows you to situate the screen at whatever angle you choose.Chrome runs very well. It's about twice as fast as the Tab / Note Pro tablet (see attached "Octane" benchmark image). Having windows is great and I have more than 20 tabs open in 4 windows with no issues. Windows are only available in laptop mode. In tablet mode it makes every app full screen. I'm expecting tablet mode to get windows when the underlying Android subsystem gets updated from Marshmallow to Nougat.Android apps generally work really well. The Kindle app is great. Google photos, Google Inbox, NY Times, all work fine although often I find no need for an Android app if there is a Chrome web version of the app. Google Maps is much better on Chrome because it shows you the 3D satellite view. Google Inbox is faster on the app version though so I use that. Sonos does not work as of this writing, as it could not find my Sonos system. I've opened a ticket with them. *Update May 25, 2017* Sonos works now.I loaded up the "Asphalt 8" road racing app and it was very responsive. I didn't see any stuttering as seen on some of the online reviews of the Chromebook Pro. Go figure!Battery life is good, I'm getting between 7 and 9 hours. Apps that uses the CPU a lot can reduce that quickly. To see which tabs / apps are using the most CPU, you can bring up the task manager by pressing the "search" and "esc" keys. I've found that tabs that aren't visible don't use as much CPU. Amazon often uses a lot of CPU when it's tab is visible, so I close it or switch to another tab when not using it. For some reason the Google Hangouts extension was eating a lot of CPU, so I disabled it.The keyboard works well, although it is somewhat mushy and the delete key is too small so I often press = by mistake. The touch pad works well for two finger scrolling and you can enable "tap and drag" in Accessibility settings. It has a slight rebound when two finger scrolling down a web page; when you lift your fingers the page scrolls goes back a tiny bit in the opposite direction that you were scrolling. I hope Google/Samsung can address this soon. *Update Feb 18, 2017* This was fixed by a recent update, there is no longer any "bounce back".The Samsung Chromebook Plus seems like a real keeper! Some here have suggested waiting for the Chromebook Pro, but I'm not sure that makes sense as the Plus is here today, is fast and reliable, and is a joy to use!*Update Feb 18, 2017*I am having Bluetooth issues. Sometimes it cuts in and out while playing music on the Google Music web site. Or it will stop playing through the Bluetooth speaker and start playing through the built in speakers, even though the Bluetooth connection is still established. Hope this can be fixed soon! *Update Mar 4, 2017* This is supposed to be fixed soon in ChromeOS 57. *Update May 25, 2017* Bluetooth is working fine now.I found a very nice note taking app that responds to pressure from the stylus, called Squid. There is a toolkit add-on for $2.99 that gives more features like geometric shapes.*Update Feb 21, 2017*I'm finding that I can have many Chrome windows and tabs open, many more than suggested in reviews. Right now for instance, I have 41 tabs in 13 windows open.*Update Feb 22, 2017*For those of you who like to keep lots of tabs and windows open (tab hoarding), I found this great Chrome extension called The Great Discarder. It automatically suspends idle tabs to reduce Chrome memory usage using Chrome's native tab discarding. When you do visit a suspended tab it automatically reloads. With this extension you can have as many tabs open as you want! Get it at the Chrome web store.*Update Feb 28, 2017*I installed the Android version of Skype for Business to attend work meetings. I found that clicking web links to Skype meetings did not work. The link is opened in the Chromebook's Chrome browser, which doesn't know how to send it to Skype, since Chromebook's Chrome is not an Android app. I found a work-around, which is to install Chrome for Android. Now when I click on a Skype web link from an Android app, I can choose whether to open it in the Chromebook's Chrome or in Android's Chrome. Opening it in Android's Chrome, it then gets passed properly to the Skype Android app.*Update Mar 4, 2017*I looked at some of the note taking apps on the Play store, including Squid, INKredible, SketchBook, HandWrite Pro Note and Draw, and LectureNotes. LectureNotes isn't as flashy as some of the others, and the interface is not as pretty, but it is very comprehensive in how you set it up and use it. Pressure sensitive stylus, custom pencils and eraser, draw with stylus / erase with finger, basic geometric shapes, very good selection tools, layers... about the only thing it fell down on was it doesn't go full screen in the tablet portrait mode.LectureNotes was the only one that let me import a PDF and then select, copy, cut, and paste from the PDF itself as opposed to just drawing over it. To get PDF import functionality you have to download the developer's PDFView app.
The kind of user I am: I live in the cloud, use almost all Google services, have been using a Chromebook Pixel as my primary work computer for about 3 years now. I have an Apple imac at home and a Windows laptop too, although I dont remember when last I turned on my windows laptop. Oh, and I know a thing or 2 about consumer electronics from a past job.For a user like me, this chromebook is *almost* perfect. If I could, I would give it 4.6 stars. You'll find from the other reviews the pros and cons described more comprehensively, I'll just focus on a few things:*** The cons I kind of disagree with ***- hardware "bugs" (e.g. speaker cracking, etc): I haven't personally experienced any of them. I do have one (super minor) issue with the sealing of the bottom aluminum sheet, so I just ordered a replacement, but honestly, at this stage I think I would rate the HW as top notch (given the price point)- Software "bugs" (e.g. android apps not always working perfectly...): I did experience a number of them... but I do not see that as an issue for 3 reasons. (1) the availability of (almost all) the Android apps I care about on this makes it effectively a wonderful tablet+laptop replacement, so in the grand scheme of things... I can live with a few bugs here and there (2) I trust that these bugs will disappear over time and (3) I have not yet found any "critical" bug for my work (/play) flows- keyboard ergonomics: agree it takes a bit to get used to the layout. given that I do use a full keyboard in parallel (when sitting at my desk I switch to a desktop keyboard), I am still sometimes hitting the wrong key when wanting to press backspace. But again, i see this as a very minor issue. Overall, the keyboard ergonomics are top notch given the size- backlighting of keyboard (lacks it): I was bummed about that initially (I often work in the dark). In practice, this is NOT an issue I have: the keys are sufficiently reflective and the screen sufficiently bright (at the right angle) that I can type effortlessly in the dark. I am typing this review in pitch dark room with screen brightness at 3 and I can effortlessly read all of the keys*** my cons or why I would give it 4.6 and not 5 ***- the trackpad is good (should I say great) but not perfect. I am expecting a stellar trackpad. This is almost but not it.- the speakers are weak. works totally fine, but I want more- the screen bezels are too large: the display is AMAZING, now I want more of it in the same form factor. In particular, at the bottom of the screen, there is currently 1 inch of vertical space (the part where the Samsung logo sits) that screams for becoming part of the actual display*** my pros or why I give it such a high rating ***They got the basics right: battery life is stellar, screen is stellar, size/weight top notch, keyboard very comfortable, trackpad works really well, it is appropriately powered, the memory and storage are sufficient to just not have to think about it.It is truly a convertible that is replacing 2 devices (laptop & tablet) without making compromises I can't live without). I LOVE this.Their bells and whistles actually help! microsd port is great to have, and so is the stylus (I thought of it as gimmicky, but I actually use it almost every day)price point is really good for that kind of quality
I got mine yesterday and this thing is great! The real test is when you are using Google Docs and Office 365 these are the most intensive apps for Chromebooks and this thing handles both extremely well! I've triedmany android apps, multi windows, multiple apps and the SCP handles them like a champ! Also It has a very streamlined look and it's super slim and light.One last thing; some people have been complaining that this chromebook does not have a backlit keyboard like another comparable chromebook and here's the deal: the screen brightness on the SCP is much brighter than others thus you can see the lettering on the keys in complete darkness so it's not needed. Other chromebooks on the market do not have comparable brightness to the SCP so they have/should incorporate backlit keyboards.Again kudos to Samsung for making another great product!I definitely would not pay $549 for the pro; I believe this is all the power you need in a Cromebook for what they do right now.Update: 2/22/2017: Since launch this has been my usage: office 365 a photo editing app, outlook mail app and chrome remote desktop for work along with 12 open tabs daily and the SCP is handling all that extremely well!
Purchased this Chromebook in mid-March 2017. Loved the quality of the screen. Keyboard not so great.In late-April 2017 the bottom of the screen developed a band of "static" (see the picture). I called Samsung and went through a number of troubleshooting exercises with them online (which included a complete "wipe" of the computer) and they determined it was a defective video card and said that I needed to send the computer in.It is not June 9 and I still haven't not received my computer back. I have made multiple calls to Samsung and all I have found out is that it has was shipped to another service center since the original one wasn't equipped to deal with the problem and then shipped back to original one and still has not been fixed. They have not been able to give me an estimated time as to when the computer will be fixed and shipped back to me. What they have done is say they are transferring me to speak to a representative in their "Executive Resolution Department" followed by 30-40 minutes of hold music and then a hang up. This has happened three times. When I call back they tell me that a member of that department will call me at a specific day and time and then I get no call.Save yourself lots of frustration. Acer makes great Chromebooks. The R11 or R13 would do great in place of this one. The school I teach at has hundreds of Acer Chromebooks that are used 4-5 hours a day by not so careful high school students. They have held up incredibly over the past two years and the couple of times there were problems, Acer repaired the computer under warranty in a matter of days, not months.Samsung has worked very hard to lose me as a customer. I really wanted to give them a chance and I really hoped that they would have resolved this situation. I have suggested to them that they send me a different computer or refund my money since they haven't been able to fix mine but they apparently do not care about customer relations.
Purchased this in April. At first I was very happy with it, it seemed to be pretty good. Had features I liked and wanted. Then about a 4-5 weeks after buying, that's when it all went bad. PHANTOM TOUCHES!!! You'll be using it, and then all of a sudden the display starts to spaz out. Jumping around, phantom key presses. It will continue until you force power it off. Then when you restart it sometimes goes away for awhile. However, it comes back. This is not an isolated issue, it's actually quite common among this Chromebook. Just Google "Chromebook plus phantom", and you'll see tons of complaints and videos about it. It's a huge flaw, and Samsung isn't properly addressing the issue. All they do is tell you to send the notebook in to be repaired, which takes like 2-4 weeks. And they don't fix the issue, because it starts all over again. This product is garbage, and Samsung is washing their hands with the issue. Amazon should remove this product considering how widespread the issues are. DO NOT BUY, you have been warned.Pros:- Stylus- Bright, vivid display- Decent keyboard- Build qualityCons:- PHANTOM TOUCHES/KEYPRESSES- Poor connectivity, wifi doesn't always work, even when it shows you're connected- Samsung's lack of support- Not enough cpu/gpu power to drive the high resolution display. Often becomes sluggish or choppy- Wifi doesn't seem to work while bluetooth is enabled. So much for listening to Pandora. through BT speaker.
I absolutely love this product, and would easily give it 5 stars for what it is. It does everything it is supposed to do while being very lightweight, versatile, and looking sleek.You need to understand what it is though. A chromebook is not a computer. It can run all google applications and a large portion of the googleplay store. It is more than perfect for me as a student, but it is not for you if you are looking for an art tablet or a gaming tablet. For the price, it is rather steep, but I feel that it is justified with this build quality.The battery life is not as advertised however, as it lasts anywhere from 2-6 hours depending on what you are doing. Playing games drains it very fast, while browsing the web lets it run all day basically.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase, and if you have the money and it meets your needs, I recommend it to you as well.8/2/17 EDIT: I AM HAVING HUGE ISSUES WITH THIS THING.First off, before I explain, I treat my electronics, this included, with as much care as possible (I worked my ass off for the money!), and as such, this has never been dropped, hit, or damaged in any way whatsoever. It has always been handled carefully and is in perfect condition, so these are all software issues.The touchscreen is buggy. Very buggy. Usually a few hours a day (in a full day of use) the screen freaks out. It acts as though it is being randomly touched in random places sporadically and it is entirely unusable when it is like this. Restarting it solves the issue for a few minutes only. It's impossible to get through a movie as it randomly pauses it and unpauses it- and a movie is long enough that the issue WILL occur sometime during it.The Bluetooth struggles big time. It is very easy to "connect" to a speaker or headset. You put the item in pairing mode, and click on it on this laptop. In a moment, it say's "connected." But it isn't. It isn't connected at all. With any and all bluetooth devices (I've tested 6-7) it takes anywhere from 2-20 (yes, twenty) minutes to get it to work. The only effective way of doing this to unpair it in the settings, and set it up as a new device. This takes an annoying amount of time. Oh hey, my screen just started glitching again. I guess that means I should hurry this up.After checking online, these issues seem to be somewhat common, and yet Samsung customer support is useless telling me to reset the device even though I specifically made it clear that that didn't work the first 3 times. So it's not just me.Also, it doesn't have a caps button. Only a search button in its place that opens up google search. Stupid feature. It can be remapped in the settings.Taking off 3 stars for all of these new issues. I would give it 0 if I didn't love it so much when functioning. However rare that is.
My background is 30+ years in the consumer electronics industry: Iâve owned numerous consumer electronics companies as well as a consultant for many leading consumer electronics corporations. Iâm currently in Asia and I wanted a new laptop. Since Iâm a die-hard fan of Chromebooks my choice was easy; the new Samsung Chromebook Plus for itâs size, weight, performance and battery life. I currently own 3 other Chromebooks and absolutely LOVE them all! I want to start off by saying how INCREDIBLY AMAZING Amazon is when it comes to customer service. When I ordered the laptop Amazon shipped it directly to me in Thailand. When it arrived, the Samsung Chromebook case was defective through no fault of Amazon. I called Amazon and asked what to do; an Amazon representative told me to ship it back to them and once they receive it they would send me out a brand new replacement unit and credit me back for the shipping BOTH ways! If anyone ever has ANY doubts about buying from any company other than Amazon in a feeble attempt to possibly save a couple dollars DO NOT DO IT! There is not a retailer on planet earth who backs up their products like anyone else...believe me, I get paid lots of money to work with some of the largest electronics corporations in the world to streamline their customer service and customer retention departments...Amazon is head and shoulders above them all!PROS:Size and weight...as I said, I travel a LOT and having a lightweight, thin laptop is imperative for me. This Chromebook weighs less than 2.5 lbs and easily slips into a backpack, brief case or carry-on bag with ease.Battery: As good as any I have tested and used; approximately 10 hours watching videos with the screen brightness at about 50%. I can watch numerous movies in High Def on overseas flights without worry of my battery dying. It charges in around 2 hours from a completely dead battery.Display: Wonderful, clean, crisp and easy on the eyes. This screen is equally impressive regardless of what Iâm watching; a High-Def movie, a YouTube video or typing a report. Resolution is fantastic, colors are vibrant, accurate and true to life, tremendous detail, sharp blacks and white colors...typical Samsung high-end screen quality! Thereâs a reason Samsung will be supplying Apple it's OLED screens for the new iPhone 8.Touch Screen: Once again, itâs typical Samsung ingenuity; precise and balanced. All gestures work perfectly and the screen is ultra responsive.Pen: I honestly did not care much about the pen when I bought it and assumed I would only use it once or twice a year at most. The pen has turned into quite a nice feature for me to capture parts of the screen image, for notes, drawing circles around certain parts of messages, web sites etc. I now am hooked on it and wonder just how I lived without it?Fit and Finish: Like all Samsung products, their design is in a word sexy...nice lines, curves and subtle details where needed, not overstated but more functional and aesthetically pleasing in IMO. The keyboard works perfectly fine for me...the keys feel solid and the trackpad is precise. I would have preferred a back-lit keypad but for the price and functionality Iâm MORE than satisfied with this Chromebook. The only nit-picky thing I would like to have changed is the accessibility of the Micro-SD card slot. Itâs somewhat under the side on the base and I personally find it not real user-friendly. Again, thatâs just my personal preference...your milage may vary.Speed and Performance: This is as fast as any Chromebook I have never tested or used. I generally have 10-15 tabs open simultaneously and it never bogs down. Every computer in the world may experience a hiccup on occasion, even $2,000 ones but this has been rock solid, super smooth and I personally have not experienced one speed-bump while using it. I canât honestly imagine why anyone would opt for the Pro version of this Chromebook???CONS:Ports: The only reason I deducted one star is because of the USB-C ports. Sure I knew that before I bought it but having now lived with it for over a month I find the USB-C ports a big headache. In time Iâm sure most of the big guys like Logitech etc. will come out with mice and keyboards with USB-C adaptors already part of their ecosystem but until they do I personally find it extremely frustrating having to use multiple adaptors to expand and personalize my Chromebook. I ended up buying several adaptors to set up my new Samsung Chromebook. I use an HDMI cable connected to a 24â?flat screen monitor as well as a wireless mouse (USB adaptor) and wired USB keyboard. I find the adaptors bulky, cumbersome and quite frankly the HDMI just does not work efficiently. It casts the screen properly to my monitor but when I open up anything from the Google Play store the screen flickers horrifically and is rendered useless! I have tried multiple adaptors from various manufacturers and they all to the exact same thing. I canât use any Play Store apps at all when the monitor is plugged in. Iâm sure itâs a Google compatibility issue with the Play Store apps that I hope will eventually iron itself out over time. For now, until more accessory manufacturers start making USB-C accessories that I can plug directly into my USB-C port I find it a real nuisance to have expensive, unnattractive dongles hanging out of my gorgeous sleek laptop.Other than the port issue this Chromebook is an absolute MUST buy! Itâs super fast, clean, sexy, lightweight, incredible battery life and the touchscreen is phenomenal! With the built in pen whatâs not to love!
It's a really nice computer. Loved using it, but has problems with touch screen. Screen would zoom in and out on it's own; scrolled on it's own; and would open random applications when nothing was touched, making it difficult to work on. Contacted Amazon about issue. They told me to powerwash device and to use chromebook repair utility. It didn't resolve the issue. I contacted Samsung about issue, they asked to send it in for repairs. I sent it in, still didn't resolve the issue. I contacted Amazon again and ended up returning the device.
2 Days InSo far so good. It's so light. Bought this to study off Khan academy and watch you tube and netflix. Tend to meet up with people at Starbucks/libraries/cafes. I had the fear of potential theft of my windows laptop while out and about so this seemed like the best choice as a daily carry machine. Messed around with the display at Best Buy and really liked it. The other reviews cover the pros and cons. I just needed this for the basics. Just got it, and I hope it won't have any issues like Shift keys sticking or wifi issues (so far none). Stylus hasn't been used much, so far. Touchscreen mostly which eliminates the need for a mouse (at least for me).Update June 19.17Watching Videos/SpeakersThe display was a major reason why I bought this machine (to watch anime/shows). If you turn the machine into a L shape, the speakers (which are at the bottom of the machine) are decent. Using the machine in an A shape (tent?) the speakers will muffle depending on the type of material you have the sound bouncing off. Like it will be muffled if its on the couch (fabric), therefore I bought a small wooden bamboo cutting board to place it on while I play my shows and that I can rotate as I wander around the room cleaning. Playing videos on high resolution did not work and took a long time to loading/buffering so I just lowered the quality.Stylus/Mouse/TrackpadI have been using the stylus more when in tent shape or tablet mode. I realized that I don't really need an external mouse since I have stylus on hand at all times. So, it might be a consideration if you are debating on buying a C to USB adaptor. The trackpad is responsive it's just taking a bit of getting used to the little differences like using 2 fingers to right click. I am not sure if there are settings for all of the Chromebook specific differences--I'm just using it as is.BatteryDepends what you use it for. I think 2-3.5 hours was the most I used the machine to continuously watch videos/youtube. (the battery also had not gone below 40%, I just prefer to keep my electronics charged above 50%). While studying and just browsing websites usage was 4-6 hours (depends if you are the type of person to recharge a machine rather than use it to 5% battery remaining)Cons: looking online, there aren't options for an alternative keyboard. I miss using swype, but using the touchscreen, keyboard, and voice search isn't a big issue, but might be for others.
HARDWARE:- ARM CPU- Full aluminum body is nice, but does not feel overly premium.- Convertible, works as laptop, tablet, and tent- Screen is brilliant. 4:3 aspect ratio with 2400x1600 resolution. Bright and super sharp.- Keyboard and touchpad are just OK. Both feel a bit cheap.- Pen works fine, has palm rejection, but there is some input lag.- SD card slot is a necessity since on board storage is really low.- USB-C only (for peripherals and charging).It's brilliant package. Samsung cut costs where it did not matter too much and delivered on the overall experience for a low price. I thought the pen is just a nice bonus, but I use it all the time. Like it much more than the touchpad or using the finger on the screen. I also use the tablet and tent options more often than I thought. Especially when just reading though some documents. USB-C charging means that I can use my car charger, external battery and smartphone charger to charge it. It also means that I cannot simply connect a mouse or projector to it. That is just a matter of time though - USB-C makes it future proof, and you can get dongles for the old USB standard, HDMI, etc.SOFTWARE:- Full fledged chrome browser in the super safe Chrome OS environment.- First Chromebook to officially support Android apps.Basically this means that it is a super secure Android tablet with a full Chrome browser - so you can use AdBlock and all web apps. (there are many web apps, for example video conference systems that do not work on Android's Chrome browser)The Play Store with all Android apps works extremely well. There are still a few rough edges, especially in tablet portrait mode, but this will be taken care of in the coming months. The Play Store is still labeled "beta".With the addition of Android apps, you have full video playback support, professional file managers, photo editing software. This drastically changes the capabilities of Chromebooks in general.PLUS vs PROThe Pro version of the Samsung Chromebook has an Intel i3 CPU. This one has an ARM chip. While the i3 should be faster in normal operation in Chrome OS, the ARM chip is actually superior for Android apps since most apps are optimized for the ARM architecture. Battery lifetime on the ARM version is also extremely good.This laptop will not replace your windows machine if you are doing professional programming, video or photo editing, ... but it is also way more versatile and capable than you average Chromebook.
I recently purchased the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro. I initially thought I would like the Pro better because it is faster. However, if you use the Stylus much - such as in Squid you will find that the PLUS has noticeably less lag than the Pro. Apparently there is some optimizations that Google has done with the OP1 and Pixel that allow what is called Instant Ink.So if you want instant ink stylus response the Plus is better than the Pro.I have also noticed the Pro seems to run hotter and have a noticeably shorter battery life.I will be sending back my Chromebook Pro and keeping the Chromebook Plus. To me the Plus is fast enough, has better battery life, runs cooler and if you take notes in Squid it is noticeably more responsive.
I bought this for my husband. It worked great and he loved it, until about three weeks later, when it started registering all these phantom touches to the screen that he never made. He looked it up online and it seems to be a common problem with the hardware. There doesn't seem to be any way to solve it except to return it to Samsung.Unfortunately it is too late to return it to Amazon, so we will have to deal with Samsung.
I see this has happened to at least one other person here as well. Purchased in February and used it all of 4 times and I take excellent care of my devices. Barely 3 months later, I took it out to prepare for a presentation and it won't take a charge or power from the AC cord. Totally screwed me over and I had to ship it off to get repaired. Mind you I live in the city where their flagship store is but they don't fix their Chromebooks there.Go figure. I am SO not happy about this. My first time purchasing a Samsung product and very likely my last.
On the whole, the CB Plus is a good Chromebook. The keyboard is good (though not excellent--but keyboard feel is subjective), the screen is first-rate, and the touchpad is just fine (though not close to my gold standard in CB touchpads: the Dell 13").However, potential buyers should note that the CB Plus (v. 59 stable channel) appears to have really hard time with less than optimal WiFi reception. If I move close the the AP, the speeds are as expected (50-60 Mbps). If I move into the next room, however, speeds drop to about 20 Mbps (still perfectly usable (signal strength is 44)). I get similar results on 5G and 2.4G (slightly better with 2.4G, probably owing to slightly better signal strength (mid 40s-50s on 2.4G, compared to about 40 on 5G)). When a Bluetooth mouse is connected to the CB Plus, WiFi DL speeds drop to about 10 Mbps.My Asus C302c (v. 60 beta channel), on the other hand, has no such problems: speeds at these two locations are consistent at 50-60 Mbps. Reported signal strengths are slightly higher on the C302c: 58 compared to 51 on 2.4G.
I had an iPad for a number of years and it was getting on in age and a big sluggish. I had a few dollars laying around and decided I was tired of its computing power (or lack of) and determined it was time to invest in something new. Of course by default, I started investigating new iPads. Brainwashed! It dawned on me that perhaps I needed to look into some alternate makes/models. I should add that I use my iPad the way that most people do I presume: watching YouTube, looking things up in Google's search engine and occasionally using Google's cloud based suite of apps (Docs, Sheets and Slides). I do also have a fairly powerful laptop that I sometimes travel with if I know I will need to write up report for work of decent heft, or if I will be gone long enough that I don't feel like answering all my emails on my phone and typing with my thumbs. I have thought about getting a detachable keyboard for the iPad in the past but decided it was kind of crazy to add a peripheral to a tablet, which was as large as the device itself.So I started looking into other devices and I came over to Chromebooks. Well let's fast forward because you all know what I ended up buying. I can say now after taking this on many trips, using it in airports, hotels and even on planes, that I absolutely love it. I laugh at the criticisms that people are giving this hardware here in other reviews, as they obviously should have bought something totally different. You don't buy a Ford Taurus and then complain that it doesn't go 120mph or ask questions like 'does it come with a spoler?'. The Taurus does not come with a spoiler, but it will get you to work everyday and then some, and you can put 200,000 miles on it. See where I am going with this?First of all, there should be almost no reason to ever install any apps on this thing. I don't play games on my phone or on my old iPad so I don't care about that. Even YouTube, the app offers nothing over the regular website in Chrome. I have installed nothing. The Google suite of 'Office' products previously mentioned also work totally fine running from the cloud. Why do you need hard drive space on this device? Use Google Drive. I have put it in convertible mode (flipped backwards like a tent) and sat in Starbucks for hours watching YouTube. I can type probably 90% of my normal ~70wpm on this tiny keyboard. I can write extensive well written emails and work on reports, spreadsheets, presentations, etc... with this awesome device. I must admit it is a little odd using it as a tablet, perhaps because it is so large (this seemed awesome on paper before I got it), and feeling the keyboard underneath seems wrong. But I think these things are in my head. You don't need RAM, or hard drive space, or USB ports, or a DVD drive. If you need those things, it is easy enough to get a decent laptop for the same price as this. What this offers that a laptop does not is extemely small footprint, low weight, great form factor, and something that is built to interface flawlessly with Google's cloud products. I am a dyed in the wool Google user so this was a perfect fit for me. If you reject their products I suppose you could use Office 365 products fairly well as those also operate in the cloud.This thing boots up in about 3 seconds. I already use Chrome on my phone, home desktop and work desktop. So this all makes sense for me. Maybe it doesn't for you. And it certainly doesn't if you want to do video editing or some other high powered stuff, this is a netbook essentially and you don't drive a Ford Taurus if you want to pretend you are in 'The Fast and The Furious'. I am 100% happy with this and I have taken it everywhere with me. Did I mention the battery life is insane? Well it is. I can't say enough about this and I can't believe I lived with an iPad for so many years. I would never ever turn back. That is nothing against Apple, I love my iPhone. Anyway, this is a great device and I suggest you pull the trigger.
My main reasons for needing a Chromebook or other tablet like device:1) Easily checking and working on google files from home when I am not working in the office2) Watching movies and tv at home or travelingFor both of these items, it's a 5 start device. I downgraded one star for 1) Some of the buggy issues with apps and software that I assume will work themselves out over time - for instance, if our wifi drops (which it occasionally does) instead of the Chromebook reconnecting, I have to restart it in order to find the signal again. 2) The speakers don't get very loud. When I'm watching something in the kitchen while doing dishes or cooking I have to use headphone to hear over my kitchen racket.I used to have a Nexus tablet and loved it, but I needed a device that was easier to email from, that's why we settled on a Chromebook. I like that the Plus was convertible, so I can use it like a tablet when not working. I have no qualms as other have had with the touch pad or tracking, but my use is literally email and entertainment. The keyboard does take some getting used to, but for the occasions I work from home or send a personal email, I have no major complaints. For my needs I probably could have gone with a cheaper device, but I'm hoping the Plus will last a long time and it's added features were a bonus to me.
I wanted to give 5 stars to this beautiful machine.However, I have been using it just some days and there are two important things that are not working well ... both seems to be real problems with the computer:1) The touch screen only works now with the pen. No matter what I do, my fingers won't make it to react.2) The WIFI it is not stable, compared with any other device connected to the same data source.What I understand is that both are real issues for many users (checking recent complaints), and the big question is if they are software and/or hardware problems. If this is about some configuration or driver update, I can wait for the software to be updated ... but if this because a hardware failure, then Samsung must define an update path, maybe to recall the machines and to fix the problems for next ones before they are shipped.Taking these two problems out of the equation, the Chromebook it is a fantastic device. The only need to be taken into consideration is that metal body machines are prone to scratches, so be careful.
This Chromebook is a home run . The screen is sharp for text and the battery life is great . It is fanless which for me is a must. 90% of the time I use this it on my lap . Web pages scroll nicely and having several windows open is not a problem. Plays you tube videos without a hiccup. Bottom of the unit gets a little warm under stress but is never hot or uncomfortable. These are issues which would be of less concern if you use it on a desktop. Wifi reception is also excellent and the sleep wake-up cycle when opening and closing the lid is quick and picks up wifi instantly which was sometimes an issue on a Macbook AIr I had owned. Sound is better than average and while I have seen complaints about the keyboard I have no issues with it. In the past I have substituted stick on letters for backlit keys but the screen on this unit is so bright I don't need them . My No 1 complaint on the previous laptops I have owned has always been the touchpad but this one is perfect for me. The touchscreen is also excellent and does better on a Chromebook than a Windows based laptop. My previous laptop was an HP with a detachable screen and it was always a bit glitchy . The ability to flip the screen and use it sitting on a counter in the touch mode is convenient as well. Having a dedicated volume control on the side of the unit is also convenient and a feature most other units don't have. The touch pointer is also easy to use and stores conveniently in the unit. Power supply is light and compact and the usb c plug in in goes in either way so no more fumbling in the dark for charging . The whole time I have been writing this I was trying to think of something I don't like about the Samsung CP and the answer is .........nothing.
I've had this chromebook for about 6 months now and I am definitely loving it each day. I was on the bandwagon of chromebooks in it's early inception a few years back and it turned me off at the lack of features that were included. Now, you can do almost everything your macbook pro, surface tablet or regular windows laptop can do. The size is perfect for travel and I like how you can still access many of the applications and tools you need even without the internet. I read books and magazines on this when I travel all the time. Oh, and thats the kicker. With it being a convertible, it makes it so much easier to read on it. You can hold it in your hand, set it on as a regular laptop or even invert it as a triangle. The bonuses that come with it are great as well. The extra google drive space, if your into music then google music has a great promo but more recently, it has a great Netflix offer. Free six month subscription. I would have never gotten Netflix if it wasn't for this offer. I'm already an Amazon Prime member so I didn't see the need to have both.
If you buy this I think you'll be disappointed. It does what it promises, but not very well. It is oh so very slow. The WIFI is slow, no matter how I connect. The keyboard reduces me to a two finger hunt and peck (I normal type at nearly 70 wpm). It runs Android apps... sort of. The apps are buggy and some fail to display key features. The apps are good, and work perfectly on an Android device. They just don't work right on this device. It sucks when you load up an app and then can't do anything but restart because the app doesn't provide a menu. I was hoping for a portable device that would be easier to manage than a smart phone, particularly for things that require lots of keyboard activity. The Chromebook isn't it. I rarely use it.
If I could give 0 stars I would. Will NEVER buy another Samsung product. This device has a KNOWN issue with the touch screen where after some time, it will no longer respond to touch except for via the supplied pen. I.e., the touch screen no longer responds to your finger. I went through the extremely painful process to obtain an RMA number from tech support and ship the device to a repair center, only to be contacted by the repair company claiming there was "physical damage" to the device (no way - it was absolutely mint, and I packaged it EXTREMELY well using layers of bubble wrap and an oversized box with a lot of packing material inside). They were trying to extort approximately $250 from me to repair it. All because of a KNOWN problem with the touch screen. I am beyond unsatisfied. Cutting my losses and buying another brand of Chromebook, preferably from a company who stands behind their product.
This seemed like the killer device for my needs at work, especially as a huge fan of Android, Chrome, and the Samsung Note series. An S-pen is a huge asset for anybody working outside an office, especially somebody that needs to produce usable maps, markup photos and screenshots to attach to contracts, and similar uses. I was excited to see a hybrid device that would accelerate my workflow.Over the last several months, I continue to be disappointed, even after updates. The pen that is integrated to this device is capable enough, but I have found the device itself wanting. Rotating the device and using websites like ISSUU - no-brainer uses for a laptop-cum-tablet - inevitably causes the device to crash. Worse, it becomes nonresponsive to the power button, and even closing the screen, then unfolding it again, fails to fix the problem.My verdict: close, but not there yet. If you really want this device, you should look at the Pro version over the Plus and read the reviews carefully to compare against your individual use case.
TL;DROne of the best laptops out there. Typing on it now, few flaws: one stuck pixel, scratched easily. Arrived to Italy on time, no complaints. Power adapter is 220VAC compatible, just get an US to EU plug adapter.Pros:- ARM CPU (aarch64)- Linux + Google = Love- No Wintel- Full Linux kernel- Ubuntu chroot on dev mode- Developer-ready AND user-friendly at the same time- Awesome screen- Good battery, fast charge- USB 3.0 over USB C- Supports 5GHz Wi-Fi- Expandable storage- Built-in pen- Good build quality- Android apps support increasingly better- InexpensiveCons:- Gets scratched easily- Not the best touchscreen- Max volume is a bit low- Touchscreen could have been betterScore: 87 / 100I might be a bit biased on this but for this price, you get a truly astounding all-rounder. You'll get used to it fast and you'll be able, with a bit of practice, to do serious productivity work on it: it never lets you down. Too bad little flaws here and there lower the score.Review:I live into the Google ecosystem (Android, Drive, Gdocs) and this laptop is a dream: it is swift, you are free from the Wintel ecosystem and the exacore arm (aarch64) provides excellent performance. Dev mode from day one, beta update channel, crouton chroot: this is likely the ultimate development environment. It is basically compatible with any USB device (since it has a fully-fledged Linux kernel) and the userland is quite complete. Android apps support is getting better and better: even strange apps run fine, and emulators such as MAME4droid run smooth. The browser is stable and the computer never crashed on me once. It gets hot, but never too hot to touch it: it is fanless and silent. The touchscreen is good, the pen is good enough for simple drawings: I think I won't be able to live without a Chromebook like this form now on. The charger is excellent: the computer is fully charged in one hour and the battery lasts for at least 5-6 hours of browsing, damn good if you ask me. Connectivity is good. Audio quality is ok but it's too low for listening to music: it's better to use headphones or a portable speaker (it does not like my Darkiron K6 over bluetoot though, nor the Dualshock 4: both cabled work fine). It supports USB 3.0 over USB C and USB multitaps (successfully used up to four devices at once). The screen is retina-like, maybe even better: the OS automatically scales down the resolution as it is too HiDPI to see text at native. Xiwi users will find this an issue: i've stuck to cli only to avoid this. One problem: i have a stuck pixel (from day one, i think). Overall build quality: excellent. The keyboard is not perfect though: the keys are a bit shallow but it's so compact they couldn't have handled it better. Lack of backlighting is not an issue: the screen is so bright that the keys are pretty lit. Mine has a weird "issue": one of the two screen brackets is slightly more opaque than the other one. Not sure why though. The price? It's a bargain.No problems getting it to Europe (Italy), everything works fine: fees around 100 euros. Amazon handles everything for you: five stars as always.
I am experiencing the same "phantom touch" issue other 1 star reviewers are explaining, despite nothing touching the touch screen whatever is open will periodically be clicked, dragged, resized, etc completely ruining the usability of the laptop. None of this happened when I first got the chromebook, it showed up about a year and a week after the date of purchase (1 week out of warranty.) Customer support ran me through updates, powerwash & recovery to no avail and pointed me to third party company licensed to service samsung products, for a hefty price of course.
I purchased the item NEW from an Amazon 3rd party supplier but the Samsung box arrived very dirty and scuffled. The overall design appears to be quite good but product build quality is somewhat questionable. The unit I received had problem reading the microSD card and the trackpad was not well assembled since it made an annoying rattle when I touch it with my finger. Interestingly, there was also a tiny smudge of glue/dirt on the top of the chromebook right out of the box which didn't seem right. As for design, the screen, keyboard, battery life and software are quite satisfactory for the asking price. The (perceived) speaker volume and acoustic is not very loud so you do need to set it at 75% most of the time. I'm returning my unit for now and might buy it again in a few months when hopefully the manufacturing quality improves.
OMG!!! I love it!! I researched all chromebooks for any entire week before making my decision on this one and it did not disappoint. The package was so light when it was delivered, that I thought that they sent me the wrong item. It could easily fit inside a woman's purse without issue. It's absolutely beautiful (but that's not the real reason it's so amazing). It's very fast and easy to set up. It instantly started when I opened it and had all of my forms, calendar, email, etc., from the moment I entered my Google email. It was set up in less than 5 minutes. It allows you to take a tour of the device right after setup, but honestly, it's so easy to use (especially if you already have a Samsung device) that it doesn't take long to figure any of it out. The speed is very swift and I can bounce from one thing to the next. My Wi-Fi was recognized immediately upon opening the device, which I've never seen happen with any other device (without prompting it first). I'm certain that it will slow down over time, as with any computer, but for now it's perfect. I love that it already has a large internal memory space, but what's even better is that it has the option for expandable memory (SD card slot- see photo) I am very pleased with my purchase and hope to get many years out of it.
Update: Have received two Chromebooks that within 30 days stopped turning on and when charging the battery flight would flicker between blue, red, and purple. I found a hack online to fix:Plug in your chromebook.Hold down the Esc, Refresh, and Power buttons until the charge light turns to solid red.Leave it charging for at least 4 hours. Charge light will turn green.Now it can be turned on.Previous review:This is the second Samsung that has broken in the last 60 days. Within 30 days the batter stopped charging and amazon replaced it. Upon receiving the second, battery stopped charging again within 30. But since it is no longer in the return window I'm stuck with this broken computer. So disappointed and down a few hundred dollars.
I've had a lot of computers, and this might be my favorite. The screen is flawless - bright and high-resolution. The stylus is a little cramped, but very responsive and pressure sensitivity is dead-on (I'm typically using Infinite Painter for drawing, which works great). A little too heavy for use as a true tablet or e-reader, but it's easy to put in "easel mode" on my lap to do drawing or play some games. Performance is so-so - definitely keeps up with multiple browser tabs and fairly intensive Android apps, but it's just a little pokey all the time. For a couple hundred dollars more, you can get the Pro version, which ought to be a lot peppier. But I got this as a second computer, and I don't need high performance. Also, if you're dubious about Chromebooks, I can only say that I have run into very few situations where it can't do what I want, thanks to having full access to both the Chrome and Android app stores.Does this have flaws? Absolutely. Keyboard feels nice but is laid out weirdly, build quality is a little haphazard with a decidedly plasticy feel to joints (you will NOT mistake this for a MacBook), but the sum total exceeds the value of the individual parts.
I really like this device. The stylus is the smoothest I've ever used it really feels like you're using a Sharpie to write on glass. I actually kind of miss the friction of pencil on paper but I'm getting used to it. The line quality is as good as I would expect with pen and paper. Excellent Palm rejection.The only issue I had with machine was I was very disappointed with my Wi-Fi speeds. Every other device in my house, including older Chromebooks would clock at between 30 and 40 mbps. This Chromebook was coming in at a very meager 0.1 to 0.5 Mbps. I spent the weekend doing research on this to discover that my older router (apple airport express) was to blame. Apparently older routers rely on a radiative wave dispersion for signals.. the newer routers utilize a beam technology. At least this is how it was explained to me. Regardless, a new router for a hundred bucks has spend this computer up to 58 Mbps. All of my other devices picked up speed as well.So now I am extremely pleased.
Chromebook Plus: 4.5 stars.Fast, no heat, no noise.Defects: no rear camera.Audio: quality just enough.But everything else is of great quality, especially in relation to the price of the computer.Hardware and keyboard: great.Very Fast on the internet.Fantastic applications in the Google Play Store.Battery: SUPERLATIVE. At the end of the day, with high usage, the battery is still at 50% !!!!!Really great!Lightweight, rotation 360 ââdegree, very nice, very bright and wide screen.Overall this computer can be compared to Surface pro 4: Surface has all the sensors: Gps, Brightness, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, etc .. and a more powerful Hardware.But the Samsung Chromebook Plus's GOAL is in the price,In the Google play store app,In performance,in High quality screen,In the reliability of the Linux operating system adapted to the Samsung App.Here you can try all, I say all the programs,Without having problems at the operating system level after uninstallation of any program. It is NOT FEW !No virus, no hackers!Beautifull pen, for beautifull Apps like: Write, ArtCanvas, etc...Another noteworthy fact is that the battery charger that connects to the electric current has a blue light that indicates that the computer is charging.By disconnecting the computer from the electric current, the blue light shuts off, the charger does not absorb more energy.Thanks to Amazon Usa, Thank you Samsung. Really a Great Computer !!!!!
This is a rocking piece of hardware. I love the pen! It has a home. It has android apps. It has a keyboard. THE SCREEN IS GORGEOUS! Tablet mode is amazing. And it has Android Apps.I'm rocking games, I'm working on my work email, logged into salesforce. Everything and it is so light and convenient and fast.Downside is the keyboard - no back lighting, wish they had included that. Keys are a bit small, but given the fact that this is light as a feather, and I can pop this sucker open on my lap and type away, totally acceptable.Maybe not a daily driver, but from a mobile perspective, what I will use from now on.
I got this after owning a refurbished Toshiba Chromebook - primarily to take advantage of Android apps. It works perfectly! The touchscreen is great for the games I want play (67 year old lady who played and loved Shivers years ago - anybody remember that game?) I have a little difficulty when working on documents and often use the older Chromebook with a mouse. It came with replacement nibs for the stylus and a tweezer to use in doing so. Small extra, but a nice touch. I recommend this highly! Oh, delivery was as stated too.
Past history has been using pcs & mac, so this 2 in 1 was my our first enticement into chromebooks. I bought both a pro & a plus to share largely with my son who is in high school. This is my review of the plus. I see 50% of reviews rate it as 5 stars & 20% rate it 4 stars. To be fair I rate it 4 stars. My top 5 drawbacks of the plus are its (i) can lacks power multi-tasking, (ii) low speak volume, (iii) touchpad over-sensitively when typing, (iv) limited android apps compatible with SCP, (v) no forward camera (which is needed by some apps). My top 5 likes are: (i) stylus, (ii) screen resolution, (iii) chromebook environment - inbuilt virus protection, low IT demands of its software, (iv) usefulness of apps that do actually work, (v) its portability. Compare to the pro, the plus does lack some power to multitask, but the battery life of the plus lasts a few more hours which is its main benefit over the pro. The plus isn't as nice looking as the pro and will pick up scratches and wear more obviously. Overall I'm happy with the plus, but i would like its durability to last at least 2.5 years to say that it a was worth the investment.
Dead On Delivery, No quick fix, called Samsung, tried to hard start it, didn't work, sending back! I really liked everything about it, it's a shame it was DOA. Now I wonder if it was a returned item recycled and resold!!!! Not Good!!!
The higher resolution screen, ability to fold over, and the touch pen made this a far more attractive option for watching videos and browsing the web than a similarly priced tablet. It is not as capable as something like the Microsoft Surface but the Chrome OS is quick and easy to use. The size makes it easy to carry in a backpack or messenger bag and the full keyboard makes typing simple. If you want a device that is primarily for web browsing this is a terrific option.
My second purchase of the CP+ is working perfectly. I returned an open-box unit last week due to a hardware glitch that caused the display to flicker uncontrollably.After comparing the C302 and the CP+ head to head for a few days, I decided although both offered similar capabilities, this CP+ offered a very bright screen and loud audio, which older folks like me value more and more each year. I am anxious to use the Android apps and love the form factor and portability of this Samsung Chromebook Plus. Perhaps I will return and update my star-rating after I have used the apps and stylus. A backlit keyboard would make this chromebook perfect. I wonder if others feel the same way, and if so, why aren't vendors understanding this.
I bought this Chromebook Plus for my niece for her high school graduation present, a year ago last Saturday. It was worth every penny, and then some! She isn't really a computer person, and was much more comfortable using her school's Chromebook and my old Acer P720 than her own laptop. So a Chromebook was the obvious choice for her, but there were so many to choose from, I spent alot of time researching them all. I chose the Samsung Chromebook Plus for her because it had everything she would need for her personal use and college needs. She loved it then, and she loves it now! A year of daily use, it is still going strong and it has served her well, at school and at home. Ease of use, built-in security and frequent updates made this the right choice for us. I would absolutely recommend the Samsung Chromebook Plus.
This is an incredible chromebook.The screen resolution default is not highest it can go but is about 25% - you can scale it all the way up quickly in settings / display settings but may have less battery time.Usb c ports can run generic & apple adapters for flawless hdmi output & usb peripherals. Everything I tried worked instantly even cheap generic ones.The speakers suck & I fear mine may be blown or damaged & poppy just from regular use - a real shame for a 2017 laptop as YouTube & Netflix was a likely use of this.Charges fast & keeps a charge like a champ
This replaces a few year old MacBook Air Pro. Apple has slowed my computers to a crawl and this Chromebook is SMOKING FAST! I have bought my last Apple product. We currently have 3 iMacs, 3 MacBooks, and 2 iPads. I'm done with Apple's daily updates, lack of innovation, and admitting they intentionally slow their machines "to save the battery". Are they so wonderful to help us? This Chromebook costs less than half of a MacBook Air. RIP Steve Jobs
Really disappointed with this Chromebook. I had to send it to an authorized repairer here in Australia as after two months the ghost screen taps issue started to occur. I noticed that the underside of the Chromebook got extremely hot as well. After having the LCD and the main board replaced I can say it is working much better with the wifi more stable, no ghost touches, heat issue has reduced and the battery is lasting longer. Hopefully no issue from here on in.I know it is not Samsung's fault but the fact that Chome OS blocks 3rd party apps from accessing external storage is a real killer and I would have re-thought this purchase had I known this in advance. There is still hope that a Chrome OS update will allow it.
I really wanted this to finally be a replacement for an android tablet. After working with the device for about a week I have no complaints about the hardware itself. Samsung's build quality was very good, and the only reason I give this 2 stars, though giving an accurate star rating in this case is rather difficult.The reason I returned the Chromebook Plus is the ChromeOS constantly prompting me to enter my 30+ random character Google account password. Apparently there is some window of time, about 12 hours maybe, where if the device isn't used you have enter your full password. This is true even if you have a PIN set up, or if by some miracle you can get the bluetooth smartlock working with your phone. I could get my phone to connect by bluetooth for about 2 seconds, long enough for the chromebook to say smartlock was enabled, but after those 2 seconds my phone would show as disconnected. This happened over multiple connecting attempts.How this password issue can be the way it is given every Android tablet or phone, and Apple too, doesn't do anything similar is a serious failure of the UX design of ChromeOS. I'm sure there is some design manager on the team ready to claim this password feature is for my benefit.I hope someday this issue is resolved so we can get some decent Android like tablets coming out again.
I bought both the ASUS Chromebook Flip C302 and the Samsung Chromebook Plus just to compare and contrast. The high resolution of this Samsung Chromebook and its dimensions are what made I chose it eventually. It's such a pleasure using this laptop!!
This is a great option as an everyday use machine. The ability to run Android apps natively, great touch screen function, conversion to tablet is easy and the hinge is strong. The stylus is my wife's favorite new feature. Can't live without it now. Ended up buying two.
I have been using this Chromebook plus for a little over two weeks. If I didn't know better, I would think it had a virus. Once a day, out of the blue, the image will start jumping around and the only control that will work is the on off switch on side for the computer. Turning off does not seem to help but eventually the shacking goes away.I have not contacted Samsung or Google yet as I don't really know the best approach to use. I like the construction quality of the device and want to like using the device. I have noticed it seems to help when I clear browsing history.I guess my main problem is the system seems to be unstable. I browse the internet, check the news, email, pay bills and use Google Docs. Pretty simple stuff. I didn't see the shaky image and then freeze up as something I would have to deal with.I am going to continue trying to work out my kinks but I am disappointed at this point. I want to make it work.
This was an upgrade from an old Acer Chromebook and the difference in speed is very noticeable. I believed that the slower speed before was just because of the Internet lagging, but it's not.I bought this mainly as a big tablet that could also be used as a traditional notebook. I seldom use it as a notebook and either use tablet mode or dock it with a keyboard and big monitor.Although it does support the Play Store I found those versions of apps no more useful than the web version so I uninstalled the Play Store.One niggle is that there is a slightly raised ridge between the CTRL and Shift key which is strange and my fingers bump up against it with the occasional odd shortcut where I need to press both together. Hardly a deal breaker, but doesn't seem to be necessary.Another slight niggle is the placement of the headphone jack when using tablet portrait mode. To hold the computer easily I hold what would be the lower edge of the screen (the portion with the Samsung logo) with my right hand. That puts the headphone jack at the bottom which presses against my stomach if I don't actively hold it up. Flipping the tablet the other way (logo left) leaves too small a space for my right hand to hold on and the buttons sometimes get pushed by mistake as they're then facing down.Overall, this is a pretty awesome Chromebook. It's not really much more expensive than the cheaper options, but the speed, light weight, and tough build are way beyond. The extra value far outweighs the 40% higher price when compared to my old Acer.
I agree that the keyboard could be better. It's not 'bad' or 'awful'. It doesn't have a lot of travel and the keys do feel a bit 'cheap'.However, if you type a lot you'll have no problems at all.The machine is light, very attractive and thin.It's responsive and quick.I cannot speak to battery life as I've not run it flat yet.This machine is replacing an Acer C720 and I'm extremely pleased with it.Obviously with Chromebooks setting up is extremely simple.Running Android apps on the Samsung Chromebook Plus is very good. I realise there are some mixed experiences as some apps don't scale to the screen well. So far that's not been my experience. I guess it depends on the apps you're using.The screen is fantastic and the sound if very good. Given the limitations I'm quite happy with the volume. I don't expect bass on these devices so if you want a stronger bass, buy external speakers that have this capacity - you can't expect miracles.
Runs Android apps great, best portable gaming platform I've used. For smaller productivity tasks, Docs works great. I was under the impression that Android versions of MS Office were available under the Officer 365 subscription, however this is not currently the case. Either way, not the fault of the device. The screen is very bright easy to read, and the 4:3 ratio actually works very well on a device this size.My only criticism is that working with larger .docx files (around 2.5mb) does tend to be a bit laggy, whether you use Word Online or Docs. Shutting down Chrome and using the just Android version of Docs worked a bit better. Don't ask this system to do too much at once.Dollar for dollar, this was a better buy than any of the Windows 10 laptops I could have bought in Australia, since the Chrome OS is so resource-light. My main criteria were high portability and enough battery life to get me through a 5-6 hour tabletop gaming session, and the Chromebook ticks both of those boxes nicely.Note for anyone considering this device outside of the US and Canada: the charger is rated for 110v - 240v, so as long as your mains supply falls within that range you should only need a socket adaptor. You should seek local advice before plugging it in though.
I love it, this is my second chromebook, my first one was a first generation chromebook which did not have enough power, well this one has plenty of power, i have been using it for 10 days now, I frequently have 10 tabs opened at a time and it performs flawlessly, the screen quality is great, battery life is as expected, and the fact that you can use Android apps with it is a game changer
A Swedish review!!!!I love my chromebook.I stopped using my regular computer when I bought a tablet a few years ago.A chromebook is 100 times better than a surfboard, I promise you .....The very reason I'm writing this is that I live in Sweden,Â And Samsung does not sell their computers in Sweden. Why Samsung? Why?I was a little worried first to order because I would not get a Swedish keyboard. Plus we have 220 volts in Sweden vs 110 volts in the United States.No problem at all, I can gladly announce.In terms of volts, Samsung is capable of both 220 and 110 volts. So all i had to do to charge my chromebook was to buy an adapter USA to Europe. The keyboard also did not give me any problems. I only added Swedish as a language on my chromebook and then I could write the letters Ã. Ã and Ã. They are in the same place as on a Swedish keyboard but have other symbols on the keybord of course.So you should not be afraid to buy from Amazon just because you live in Sweden. Everything has worked 100% for me. The product came on time, the payment went smoothly. I am very pleased with both Amazon and my Chromebook plus.
This is a great "Chromebook", the display is beautiful and I love the "limited" functions of the S-pen. I had the Asus C302 and the Samsung's screen blew it away. The build seems pretty good and the keyboard is good for me. (Some people complained about it.) Overall, I love this Chromebook.
This is my third chromebook. I did a lot of research before buying this one & I am very pleased with it. I don't use the touch screen or flip the screen like I thought I would though. It runs perfectly though & holds a battery for a long time. I would definitely recommend this computer.
So.. My laptop died on me and I was going into my fourth year of college. As a college student, we all know money is an issue. I needed something cheap, fast, reliable, light, and efficient. THIS IS IT. I have had this for 3 months now, and I have had no problems. It is super quick and I am on the go all of the time but am allowed to pick up right where I left off. The battery life is good, and you can do all kinds of cool stuff on it. I am not the best with computers, but this is super easy to figure out and use on a daily basis. So, if you are a college student and debating on whether or not to purchase this, I say YES.
Absolutely love this machine. It is very well engineered, looks top of the line and the chromeOS+Android integration is surprisingly good compared to what I was expecting after reading mixed reviews. The tablet mode works very well, the pen mode is excellent and the keyboard is responsive. Battery life is quite good and I really like the USBC charging so I can use the same charger for my phone and laptop. The only annoyance is the backspace key which is unusually placed.
After a year of use, this chromebook has stood up to the test of time. Purchased as a replacement for a laptop for netflix, it has evolved into an app machine I use for my numerous apps I use on my phone. Most are compatibile. I use it likely 3-4 hours a day as a replacement for my phone when at home and replacement for my laptop.
I got this for my grandkids. I was hesitant at first and was leaning more toward a conventional laptop. I've been setting the chromebook up and playing around with it. Now I'm thinking that when my iPad needs replacing I'll go with a chromebook myself. This particular model is great, especially with the rotating screen. Fast, lightweight, metal construction. Seems very well built.
This is a good little machine. The screen is fantastic and the stylus is really cool. I'm not a big fan of the keyboard which is a bit ticky tacky. Not a very good typing experience for someone like me that types all day long. If you are just doing casual work on the machine, then it's ok. Chrome is a great operating system but still very limited in what it can do. There's been a lot of talk about running Android apps now on the Chromebooks, but I would give the current implementation a C+. You can load the Android apps. Some work better than others and most frustratingly, some do not operate at full screen, only the same size as on your phone. Arrgghhh. If you want a cool Chromebook for a student or casual use, this is a good value. If you are looking to emulate the experience of your phone, then get an Android tablet.
EXTREMELY happy with my purchase. Of course, it will take time adapting to a Chromebook vs a laptop when I've been a laptop user since I got my first computer. However, my needs have changed and this little device fit the bill. I've also gotten back into art since discovering a few of the incredible art and drawing apps. I love that it folds in half and can be used as a tablet. Very small and lightweight compared to an oldschool macbook.
This time samsung did great job.This is my fourth chromebook. The most enjoyable one.I liked every detail. I've used 1080p screen chromebook like acer before. Samsung made the screen perfect.Even its hi res screen, I don!t need zoom .I can read texts very comfortable.Performance is very well balanced. I installed bunch of apps. No lagging. No heat issue. Battery is ok. I use heavily (youtube, netflix, blogging,surfing) 6.5 hours later it says %10 remains :)I always like to use samsung tablets but when I need to surf in internet I needed chromebook or laptops. With this wonderful machine I don't need anything else.When you use it in tablet format it shrinks to 10 inch tablet mode
Chromebook person here 5 years in. Best Chromebook to date. Microsoft 365 (from the Android Play store) closes the enormous gap in my business world which NEEDS Microsoft Word and Excel compatibility (this is enormous, this break-through cannot be overstated... yes, you WILL need a Microsoft 365 subscription to maximize... but the fact that this licensing-gap has officially finally been closed is huge ...HUGE!!!). Picture/brightness/definition of picture-video is unbelievably good (and the odd-ball aspect-ratio showcases video and web-sites in such a nice way). This snappy-ass machine has such an instant no-hiccup response to my touch-pad and mouse. Solid nice build (weight, dimensions, etc are all spot-on). Only reason not a five-star rating is two-fold... One, the outer metal'ish top-surface scratches easily (a major problem which I expect will and certainly needs to be fixed in future versions). And two, when opened up in laptop position, the weight of the top screen-half (if opened 91+ degrees) lifts the right-corner of the bottom keyboard-half closest to me up from the surface by about a half a millimeter (which creates slight rocking, which is a pretty big ouch... but I am guessing that this flaw is just a one-off flaw that is not to be expected in all Chromebook Plusses across the board). This said; unless you drop full-blown coin on the Pixel Book, Samsung's Plus might very will be the best there is to get at this moment in (our relatively young) Chromebook history.
I wanted to use my new chromebook for a couple of weeks before I reviewed it. I honestly though the Plus would work well for me, and for the most part it does. However, I have managed to crash it once or twice by having too many apps/tabs open at once. Other than that, it is very functional for me. I enjoy being able to use some of the same apps I have on my smartphone on my chromebook. Its fairly fast, very light, has a great screen and keyboard, and I really like the stylus. I've not used it in tablet mode often but like it when I do. This is a really good machine if you mainly spend time surfing the web, playing games, and light work in Google Drive.
This little do dad is amazing. Starts up super fast and is pretty as a picture. It did have a few hiccups after the first few months. But that wasn't anything that the good people at samsung couldn't fix. They paid for shipping & it was a week turn around to have it working like new.
Absolutely LOVE my chromebook! I went from having Windows laptops my whole life, so I was a bit nervous to try a Chromebook. It has been the best decision I have made. As a college student I was worried that I would not be able to download word documents or have other office problems, but I have yet to run into an issues! The chromebook has everything I need!
The bad: it scuffs easily.The good: super slim, convertible, great display, seems to keep getting better with frequent OS updates (the unlock-by-phone feature only worked intermittently when I first purchased, now it works about 90% of the time?). Comes with a lot of freebies (6 months of Netflix, etc).
Great for mobility computing. I especially appreciate the ability to run most of the Android Apps from the Google Play store. Once I installed backup and sync on my main work laptop, access to files was simple both ways.I wish Chrome Browser and Google Doc on the Chromebook also supports Grammarly, my favorite style and grammar checker on Microsoft Word.
Great tablet, it said that games can be played on it, I thought any game but I didn't know that Chromebooks didn't let Minecraft be logged in. It was a birthday gift for my grandson he was very excited and was very upset, when he found out it wasn't letting him log in to Minecraft.
This thing is awesome. Wife likes the keyboard, I use keyboard and the touch screen works great. Battery life has been great for us and our use as an iPad alternative.Me and my kids love using the pen and the native drawing app. Very good quality. The few apps we've used have worked great, haven't had any app issues.
Dead within 3 months, wont charge, wont turn on and now Im stuck with a limited warranty and might get screwed by samsung support, buyer beware
Being a baby boomer with little technical knowledge about tablets, chromebooks, etc., I have to say the Samsung Chromebook Plus is very user friendly and I'm enjoying using it and the having a lightweight alternative to my laptop. Love the touchscreen and not needing a mouse.
For me, this fit my needs perfectly. I am a 20+yr IT professional who drank Microsoft's cool-aid in the corporate environments for years. The Google Chrome OS is great. This Chromebook is lite without all the bloat that you typically get with Windows OS. Plus, with the ability to use the Google Play Store, it makes this that much better. From my couch I can control my ecobee3 thermostats, while streaming music via Chromcast to my NAD 338 amplifier, and even control the volume from the nifty NAD remote app. All while surfing the internet, Facebook, Amazon (shopping of course), or just being lazy.
awesome device! high quality. love the 3:2 aspect ratio too! for getting work done the additional vertical room is very welcome... more manufacturers should adopt this (16:9 belongs on TVs, not laptops!)
I bought this laptop as an emergency replacement when my $800+ Windows laptop died right before college finals week. Several months later, I'm still using this as my main laptop. While frustrating with the lack of access to certain favorites (Photoshop, Illustrator, The Sims 4, etc), it's a sturdy and sleek laptop with fast load times that can handle a lot of tabs, etc. For a mid-end Chromebook, it's probably my favorite model. The convertible factor and touch screen are only nice additions that only sometimes come in handy.
I love this but I am disappointed with the parental control. Google removed the supervised user feature so no parental control available except for family link, which is a horrible app. My son had to create a new google account to get this app. He could not even use his old google accounts at all in this chromebook. He has to use his other google accounts for his school, but to use family link, it was not allowed.I am happy with all other features of this chromebook, but the main reason i purchased this was for my son's school work. This became useless.I don't know why Google remoeved "the supervised user function" which was the main reason I chose chromebook. I am going to return it.
I love my new chromebook - it's exactly what I needed - the ability to create documents and use the internet - and it's so fast. Love it, love it, love it! I'm going to be purchasing one for my daughter to take to college with her.
Worked great until the bottom half of the screen went fuzzy and started blinking. We only bought it 3 months ago. We've only used it at home on the couch. Its never been dropped or taken anywhere.
Great machine!!I purchased this for my mom who found using Window 10 familiar but very confusing w/ all the changes. She absolutely loves this! She's been using it for 2 months or so and I haven't once gotten a phone call saying "This thing is broken" or "Why is it soo slow?", which was close to every other week. Both my fiancÃ© and I have been using chromebooks for sometime and love them.The only reason I'm not giving a full 5 stars is although the 'help me with my computer' calls have stopped completely now. I haven't used the machine myself apart from the initial setup.
loved it until the space bar stuck a few days after return window. scroll doesn't work either. now I have to send it back for repair and have no co mputer. t hanks samsung. excuse spacing, using t he keyboard looks like this.
I am a big fan of the chromebook and have owned three. This one is a little more expensive but what I enjoy the most is the improved led lit display which unlike the other ones, looks great at different viewing angles.
I love this Chromebook.Great looking, very compact, easy to use and user friendly pc.I think it looks better than the Chromebook proBut the Hebrew support, not the best. Some things not working when you using Hebrew on this Chromebook.
This thing is for surfing the web and it is good for it. The touch screen and stylus will spoil you. I am not joking about that. When I use my old laptop now I find myself touching the screen.
This is a fantastic convertible laptop. ChromeOS is everything I need without the fussiness of Windows or the price of a Mac. This model feels very premium and is fast and responsive. The keyboard feels lovely, but it is a little small. The only thing about it that has been a little inconvenient is the backspace key is a little small. The battery life is about 8 hours with moderate use. Sometimes more or less depending on how many tabs I've got open and how many videos I watch. It's a great machine at a fair price point. I just wish they were sold in Australia so I didn't have to buy a new charger.
Brilliant laptop and excellent value for money. This little laptop is my go to device for browsing the web, watching YouTube (capable of watching 4k), checking emails, signing documents (with the pen), basic word-processing (using both Google Office and WPS for Android). Most Android apps work and integrate well. Everything is fast and responsive. Machine starts up instantly. Screen in gorgeous and rivals mac retina displays. Battery capacity is ample. Tablet functionality works seamlessly. Aside from music production (which I still do on my Mac), this does 95% of what I require. Love it!
I have been researching laptops and decided on the Chromebook. I have only had it a few days and love it already. It is a laptop and tablet all in one. Very easy to set up and transfer all data from phone.
Probably the best non-phone android device ive ever purchased. Takes a bit to get used to the o.s. Its literally a big foldable Samsung w/no phone, but does a great deal more than that.My only quirks:You can have apps from the app store, or have them in the chrome browser, via web store. I chose to have them from the app store so as not to "clog up" the browser.It will connect with my Sandisk wireless usb, uploading and downloading easily.(although ive been chastized for this because apparently it doesnt allow that, go figure! Some people!) But. I cannot download images from my cameras to the chromebook wirelessly, again, go figure. It isnt a windows machine, but it doesnt try to be either.As always, i spent my own hard earned money on the products i review.
I never write reviews but I thought this was important. I love the functionality and features of this Chromebook. It is very fast, has incredible resolution and the battery life is great. The only issue I am having is it drops the wifi connection. I have a dual-band router through Comcast and never have any issues with my phones or desktop. However, when I start to stream a lot of data the wifi connection is lost. The only way to get it back is to reboot. I am a network engineer by trade so I am pretty sure I know what I am doing. I contacted Samsung and they suggested the reboot method as well, but I consider that a workaround and not a solution. I am hoping more people will see this problem and they will instrument a fix.
I have had chrome books for years. I tried to like the apple laptops but they lacked touch. I tried to like a two pound laptop which had touch but the case was flimsy. Then Samsung releases the Plus. Ilove it. I check my emails, shop, Facebook, watch movies, chat, Skype, print, type, search, listen to music, whatever. I call this my happy box. It is fast and reliable. I have m s so it being light weight is important. Buy this. It is the best.
I upgraded from an older Acer tablet/laptop hybrid (Aspire model). It was good but I needed something more powerful and with better battery, etc. This Samsung Chromebook is just what I was looking for. I do pretty much all my work in the cloud - so running MS Windows-based programs is not necessary for me on mobile. I do have a PC with MS Windows that I still use for certain applications.PROS:1. Display quality is amazing. I'm sure this is because it's a nice upgrade for me but - unless on the beach in the sun - not sure the highest brightness level will ever be necessary.2. It just works - well. Speedy, efficient and quite simple.3. Light and durable in construction.4. The included stylus is a great added feature. The handwriting in Evernote/similar seems to work very well.CONS:1. Keyboard keys are a little tight (very minor complaint).2. As I saw others mention, the trackpad isn't fantastic but it seems to work well.Overall a great buy in my opinion!
Good balance between price, weight, and display resolution. I would like better battery life but I dont think I've seen that in any laptop with this display res at this weight.
The Chromebook I was looking for my office. I can work with my spreadsheets, docs, and even sign contracts and documents. It is really thin, light and great looking. So far, I am very satisfied with this purchase.
Awesome computer, small and light. nice fit with android phone, because of the bigger screen. We use it in multiple configurations, tablet, laptop, easel. touch screen works, camera works.
I think this Chromebook from Samsung is a great product.Sure, always depends on "expectations", is not and hi-end or hi-level pc, but is and absolutely good combination between a tablet and a notebook.Th OS is fast, really fast. Even if this chromebook is equipped with the ARM processor, all seems perfectly optimize and run very well.Is nice you can install apps from the play store, they works great (at least the ones I tested).the battery last for 6-8h depends on usage, but looks pretty decent to me.only downside, the audio quality is not the best. Sound is clear but is a bit "low" and not really "rich" in bass.I think for the price is a very good deal.
While there was a learning curve, going from an eleven year old laptop to a Chromebook, I now love it. So fast and portable. Charges quickly with excellent battery life. Love the touch screen, purchased an add on number pad for spreadsheets. Never use the stylus though.
I absolutely love this chromebook.great price, ez to use,very light, nice design, good battery life.the only con is the sound.
This is my first Chromebook after years of using a laptop. I love this machine. It's perfect for what I need to do. The loading time is fast and the screen is bright and clear. I did have to get use to the keyboard but after reading the shortcuts, I have no problem. It's nice that I can download some Play Store apps. I wish more app developers will start making their apps optimized for the Chromebook...hopefully in the future.
I love my chromebook. I use this mostly when I am outside, at home I use my laptop. But this serves me very well when I am out and about.
It's an excellent Chromebook. The pen works flawlessly. I haven't experienced any lag after updating the Chromebook. The only thing I noticed is that in order to install apk so far is if you enable developer mode which is kind of annoying right now.
Great device. Fast, responsive, and looks great. The touch screen works perfect and almost no latency between the pen and the screen. The keyboard has a good feel to it and while the touch pad isn't perfect it still does a good job.
The unit I received has issues with phantom touches. Samsung wanted to have it for 2 weeks in order to fix it. It was an excellent laptop, but Samsung's continued drop in hardware reliability has killed it for me. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this Laptop.
It was great for 3 weeks. Then the touch screen died.
I bought this even reading the comments about the touch screen glitching and Iâve experienced kinda the same thing just not as suver. When drawing the lights go little left or right then what u want but a very little. Not that big of a deal and sometimes freezes for a good 30 seconds. Or wonât let u click objects. So look out for that but itâs so nice for drawing or making construction plans. Even for notes!!
Great machine! Lightweight, easy to use, touch screen, Android Apps, and FAST!
Great device for a student, however if you have multiple tabs open and multiple apps open then it may run hot. Also, make sure you understand it has a USB c port! Other than that it is a keeper!
Love the item. Came quickly, well packaged and brand new. No problems since December purchase. Bare bones laptop, perfect for web browsing and emailing. Light enough to carry along with a regular business laptop. Lightweight portability is perfect for travel. Flipping it back and using the stylus is pretty fun.
This is perfect for homework for my middle schooler. Also, I use it to draw using the Adobe sketch program. Much cheaper than an ipad pro!!
I absolutely love this laptop. The versatility of it is great. It's very lightweight. The pen is awesome too. If I could rate this above 5 then I would. I purchased it as a refurbished item and I can't even tell.
This is full of win. Ever since the first smart phones have come out, I've faced the problem, some things are better done on the desktop, and other things are best done on the phone or small tablet. To me, this is the best of both worlds. It's a very light laptop, but it's a very high quality and resolution screen. You will probably NOT use it at its highest resolution, but it's got the clarity of working on a larger monitor. It's a tablet, and a fairly large one at that, so using it for drawing or as an e-reader for fullsize PDFs is easy. And those phone apps, those run on it too. Admittedly, the one drawback is that not all apps gracefully adjust to the larger screen. They will, because using android apps in a desktop style environment and resolution is on the way!
I absolutely love this. I sold my old Chromebook and my old Android Tablet. The keyboard can be frustrating occasionally until you get used to it. Reading music on it is the best experience since I got by original iPad 7 years ago. The wonky screen size really is much better for tablet than the usual Android 16:9.
I'm happy with this, it is a little taller than it is wide which was strange at first but the keyboard has a nice size and fit and finish on this one is nice.
Awesome product! My only complaint is that the battery doesn't last as long as other Chromebooks I've used. The screen ration is a little out of the ordinary as compared to current laptops and Chromebooks as well.
I like it. Amazing display!! I don't think that it would be great as your only machine but as a secondary portable device it beats i pad out ( I like apple have a MacBook pro) l.
Product lightly used for two months and now does not turn on. Samsung customer service will not help me as I purchased this in the USA but live in Canada. I do not recommend. UPDATE: Amazon has taken over the warranty and everything looks like it will be taken care of. THANKS AMAZON!
Loving it! Although it lags a little bit and that some of its features such as the android apps compatibility is not working so well, as a laptop with light weight and that is 360Â° reversible, it is pretty awesome. It has been 3 days so far and my friends liked then design of it as well as the fact that I can use it to take notes in class without being distractful to others.
best thing I had in my tech devices, although the pro version would be a good but believe me if you are using as your daily devices it will do the job pretty amazingly, sound is one of the concern as everyone is saying but for me it's perfect. stereo sound. The battery is perfect ...... The screen is beautiful.The best laptop today.delivery and amazon service is a little bit not up to the mark . other than amazon services definitely recommended
Configuration nightmare. When connecting to home router will not recognize password although two other regular computers and a chromebook does. Then trying to use smart phone hot spot, connects, then after awhile disconnects and when trying to re-connect get "out of range" error. When using a different phone, everything works.
The best Chromebook that money can buy in that price rangeto top it allit is convertiblea touch screenit has a stylus Very sleek design and very very easy to carryHas great battery life lasts me two working days at least
I absolutely love this machine. I had never owned a Chromebook before but at this price point I don't think I'd consider getting a Mac again. Beautiful design, light weight, fantastic display, decent battery and instant start up.
Perfect Laptop. I'm going to ditch all my other machines and use this exclusively.
The Samsung Chromebook Plus is a good machine, but the software has been unreliable. The Chromebook PlusÂ Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Touch Laptop (XE513C24-K01US)works well as a convertible, and the pen/ drawing functions work well. It is handy for reading and basic office work. But the software has become unreliable, with multiple crashes and freezes, and applications losing their data. Neither Samsung nor Google/ Chrome seem able to resolve the problems.
I love this chromebook! it has such a bright screen! I do wish it had a USB port tho, but other than that, it's excellent!
This was money well spent. It took some time to get used to the operating system (Iâm a MAC guy), but once I became familiar, this is perfect for what we need it to do.
I've had the CB+ for a couple of weeks now, and I love it. For me, it replaces an aging iPad which I used for reading the news, websurfing and writing (using a brydge keyboard). This has a bigger, better screen and is obviously a much better writing device. The addition of Android apps was the decider for me. Great screen. Light. Premium feel. Nice keyboard. Android apps.
brilliant chromebook couldn't fault it, Slick slimline design gives it the characteristic of a MacBook at an affordable price, Would recommend it if you are a medium user it does a lot of function except for Microsoft office that you need to sideload in the Google chrome as an app with a subscription. All in all is a nice little book for not so advanced user.
Google play Beta is still a little glitchy but, this laptop/tablet is worth it. Screen is awesome!
I can't explain in words how much I love the Chromebook! Best purchase ever!
So far, soooo good. It is super fast and easy to set up. Make sure you get an adapter if you only have USB devices...Making my mate jelly...
Since day 1, touchscreen started to have responding issues, first it didnt work, after turning it to tablet, it completely went out of control doing anything but what I wanted, I have read all the forums and dont see any friendly solution, I truely hope this can be fixed / changed, I have just a few weeks with the chromebook without being able to actually enjoy it.
The touch screen stopped working in less than a month. Now it works only with the pen. Kinda slow also. Volume and battery could be better.
super light
The build quality is excellent. Very portable and the battery easily lasts 8hrs. I mainly use my chromebook for web browsing, live streaming of live football, netflix, etc. Hence I never found it lagging in doing any of this. Excellent product and totally worth the buy
Great quality, but why the tinny sounding downfiring speakers? Returned it for an ASUS flip.
Gift for husband, he loves it and may have to buy another one!
I love the fact that it is potable, Its easy to operate and it's fashionable. But I have the following challenges1. How to operate an offline office package on it, do I have to pay monthly to operate word,excel etc.2. I Am finding it difficult to open most of my documents on my flash drive, it tells me that the program is not supported by the device.These are two major issues for me if resolved then it becomes a perfect device for me.
This Chromebook is not availabele at the European market but I bought it at Amazon. I love the metal finish and the slim design and that it works with the Play store as well as the Web store. I only miss the EURO sign on the keyboard but I higly recomend this Chromebook!
Great product with super features.- Excellent battery life- Excellent screen in direct sunlight- Vivid colors- Super build quality from Aluminium
I love how lightweight this is and the display is fantastic. Still waiting for good pen apps and some Android apps don't work very well, but others, especially video streaming apps, work great!
Has been a great laptop/iPAD alternative for my daughter. She had an iPad Air, but hardly uses it now that she has this.
Size and weight.
I like the low weight, thin profile, very bright screen, 4:3 screen size and responsive keyboard and track pad. If you use Google apps or Chrome IOS, this is the Chrome Book to get.
I receive this chromebook on 7/7. it a great portable device that I have been using everyday to browser, school work and watch video on. The problem i have with it is, that the wifi connection speed will drop and if watching video or browsering, the laptop does get warm near the hinge.
Bought this for my as a replacement for my son to replace his dying laptop. It is the coolest piece of tech in our house and I am jealous! Great battery life. Great Android app functionality. Zero complaints!
Snappy response, Android Apps, bright touchscreen, what's not to like?
Great laptop. Chrome Book with android apps, is even better. This is not a one handed device.
Chromebook Plus Review 2.0Opening: Overall great device that could be priced more at the 399.99 mark rather than 449.00 it usually goes for. Below is the pros, neutral, and cons.Pros: Thin and light (only 2.4 lbs). Beautiful display (2400 x 1600). 2 in 1 device. Chrome OS is easy to use, and has android apps. Includes pen, that is stored in case. Performance and battery life are good.Neutral: Keyboard is just average, feels kinda mushy when typing. Speakers-have to be turned almost all the way up to get best performance. Weird looking in laptop mode (screen is tall). Feels odd in tablet mode (can feel the keys in the back).Cons: Couldn't think of anything so Iâm going with price. At 449.00 ( I bought mine at 419.00) it is too expensive when compared to some of the windows hybrid offerings which can have better performance and the full windows experience on a 2 in 1 device.Competition: I feel this device is better than the tablet first offerings from Apple (Ipad pro), google pixel, Lenovo Yoga book. The competition against windows hybrids is more tight as there are 2 in 1âs in the same price range that have more power (maybe not the battery life).Conclusion: I have used mostly windows devices but this chromebook plus is a keeper for me as itâs dual tablet/laptop modes and its ability to use android apps with chrome os put it above the others.
My wife loves it so far, and so do I.
Coolest computer for my 9th grader. Want to get one for me now! She loves the touch screen/tablet likeness of the flip around screen. Light weight and built in stylus are also super cool. Great device for the price!
It was for my grandson and he went nuts. Itâs a laptop with more memory than he originally could afford.
Good price for not-new laptop-tablet hybrid.
Gorgeous display, measured as 117% sRGB and 370 nits. As a 2400*1600 screen this is fantastic!Stylus response is good.The only thing you might dislike I think is the keyboard, a bit shallower than normal ones and also lighter to trigger.
Love the pen!!
It does pretty much what was expected. It is a fine piece of hardware. Still not as versatile as a computer though, but does exactly what I thought it would. I really wish I could seamlessly use office and other apps on it.
Gf loves it
Best gift from me to me. No regrets here. So far it works without any mishaps. I highly recommend it.
My review will cover pros and cons to help others determine whether given the brand and retail price point of $450, this is a worthy purchase. Note I bought the Samsung CB+ device for $350.Cons:*Overall: A bit shocked by the issues noted below given the notoriety of the Samsung and Google brands and the pricing of the CB+. At $450 I would say the device is not worth the price, but since I got it for $350, I'm on the fence about keeping it. I suppose at $350 or less I'm willing to tolerate these nuisances given the pros.1. Trackpad Sensitivity is Weak - My prior laptop was a MacBook Air which had a superior trackpad, so perhaps this is what you get for $450. I find it slow to react to a light touch, especially if you are one who relies on tapping versus clicking. You can increase the speed of the cursor, but you can't increase the sensitivity of the actual trackpad to react to being touching lightly or hard. I imagine this inferior trackpad is due to this device also being touchscreen - can't complain if you can just touch the screen.**update - determined the trackpad has a bit of a "dead zone" around the left and right edges. Doesn't respond to touch until about 0.5 to 1 inch in from the left and right.2. Caps Lock Button Missing - There is no caps lock button. There is a Google Search button in it's place. You must use the shortcut Alt+Search to enable caps lock and hit Shift to turn it off. This significantly slows down typing for me and am having difficulty retraining my brain not to hit the Search button. Typing this review I've hit it at least 10 times already accidentally. Seems silly to get rid of caps lock given this is how every keyboard is configured. It's like swapping the q and m buttons. There are volume buttons at the top of the keyboard and on the side of the device with the power button. Instead of having 2 sets of volume buttons, they could have kept caps lock and moved the search button to the space at the top occupied by the second set of volume buttons.3. Unlock is Inconsistent - Your options are to unlock with Google password, Smartlock via your phone Bluetooth, or a Pin. Your options to login are your Google Password or Smartlock. I find that even coming from unlock (not login) the CB+ doesn't always present the option to enter a Pin. I'd say I'm probably given the option to enter my Pin 50% of the time. On top of that, it takes several minutes before it finds my phone, even when BT is enabled and the phone on top of the CB+. Sometimes it doesn't find the phone at all. If you have a complex Google password be prepared to login to your password manager to retrieve it every time you want to login to your CB+.4. Extensions Slow Down Browsing - I only have 3 extensions and have noticed significant slow down in pages loading which I never experienced on the MacBook Air.5. Apps Not Optimized for CB+ - I find that many apps don't seem quite compatible with this device. For example, VPN extension works great while the same VPN app does nothing.6. Adobe Flash - Occasionally encounter issues with Flash sites not loading that I've never had before on other devices.7. Backspace Next to Lock Button - The backspace button is very short and is directly under the lock button. This is poor placement of a button that will lock your computer to place it next to a commonly used button. I've accidentally locked my CB+ when trying to backspace.8. CB+ Hard Case - Samsung does not offer a hard case accessory for this device. The hard case by iPearl sold on Amazon prevents the device from fully folding into tablet mode.9. Speakers Weak - You probably need an external Bluetooth speaker if not casting to a TV.10. Random Issues - Certain tabs will go fully black with bands of white through it. Randomly had the whole screen freeze for several minutes. Closed and re-opened screen twice until it appeared to re-boot. Again CB+ did not find phone via Bluetooth to utilize Smartlock and proceeded to indicate Bluetooth was turned off. Upon finally logging back in, I confirmed Bluetooth was on the whole time.Pros:*Overall - I love the versatility of the device being reversible, touchscreen, and the built-in pen. Given I primarily need a device for internet browsing and casting videos, this meets my needs.1. Reversible - Easily convert from laptop to a tablet. Use the keyboard to prop it on a table in a shape like this: ^ or this: _\.2. Touchscreen - Easily navigate between apps, chrome tabs, etc. with touchscreen in laptop or tablet config.3. Pen - Create screenshots or hand written notes/drawings with the pen.4. Apps/Extensions - Choose between installing Google Play apps, using Chrome Web store extensions, or links to regular web apps.5. Cloud - Store and sync your notes, documents, pictures, etc to Google Drive and access it from your other devices.6. Chromecast - Cast tabs and videos with your Google Chromecast using extension or Google Home app.7. Swype - Touchscreen keyboard already enable to recognize Swype entry.
Itâs great . Great laptop bought after my MacBook Air is broke
Only thing it lacked was hard drive space and additional USB ports (standard for most Chromebooks) easily over come by purchasing 128g sd and a hootoo shuttle/dongle. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 is because of minute/nitpicky stuff.
It's not a literal dream come true, but damn, it comes close. If you're thinking of getting it, just get it already.
Constant WiFi issues that I could not resolve. Went on Chrome OS forums and was told it was my router... I'm writing this on my Lenovo Chromebook without issue. Tried everything to get it to connect to WiFi to no avail. There seems to be a lot of people having the same connectivity issues with the plus model.
love it! Bright and beautiful, light and a serious luxury upgrade for someone who is used to using a basic chromebook.
Great chromebook! lots of features!
WOW The best chromebook ever!! je le conseil Ã  tous le monde qui veut un ordinateur portable abordable, lÃ©ger,mince et robuste !
I have been using this for about a month now. I like it. Great build quality. Snappy. Not all android apps work on it but enough to make it a great Laptop/Tablet/Phone hybrid. (Hangouts and Skype paired with a bluetooth over wifi will allow you to make calls.)Normal windows apps will not run on it but if you have a windows PC you can remote in to it using Chrome desktop. I have used remote desktop sessions with it to access it.
So far it works great and last for days
For a basic chromebook is the best you will ever find. It is so light and the design si beautiful. But if you are looking for a high performance machine, don't go for this one. I give it five star rate because it is a great computer if you are going to use it for the basic stuff.
Really happy with this Chromebook. I had another Samsung Chromebook before and you can easily tell the difference.-Great Screen-Android apps are a major bonus-you can even work offline using a few tricks.Totally recommend it!
This is my first Chromebook and I love it
Better than the Macbook Pro that died after 2 weeks and was $1000 more expensive. Much faster too.
watched allot of youtube videos - and allot of them are correct. The screen is wonderful. Keyboard is cramped in, and it takes allot to get use too.They could have made the backspace bigger. Was thinking of the Asus Flip as well, but decided on the Plus instead. Overall happy with this purchase.
touch screen issue it's unusable
It's wonderful to be able to use Android apps on this beauty. Love it also that I don't need to wait for it to boot up.
The only reason I am giving it four stars and not five is because of the keyboard, which is okay but could be better. Otherwise, it is a great chromebook.
Chromebook is the most efficient and easy to use computers I've had. I will never go back to a PC or Mac!
So fast! Love it so far ,but wondering where to get more instructions
### Updated Sep. 1, 2017 ###The latest Chrome OS update has corrected the fullscreen app persistence issue. Thank you Google & Samsung! Android apps now remember their previous state and will launch or restore from lock in fullscreen mode if they were previously running fullscreen. That's one major annoyance down.Moreover, the entire Android subsystem appears to have received a major overhaul with this latest version. Not only does fullscreen mode persist, apps no longer have to restart after unlocking the device. App stability seems to have been largely unaffected, at least based on the small sample size I have installed. Now if they would just fix the video stutter and allow us to disable that cursed lock button!### Original review follows ###I've been using the Chromebook Plus every day for the past three months and decided that I had given it enough time to "grow" on me as much as it was going to. My use case may not be typical so please consider it when making your purchase decision. I travel a lot and as a result, many of my opinions are based on how good the user experience is in the context of sitting on flights and in airports. Before I go into detail, the TL;DR version is that for someone like myself, it's good not great and has some major annoyances.The Good- Display is colorful, defect free, with very little backlight bleed and the 3:2 aspect ratio is perfect for a hybrid device such as this.- Hinges are sturdy and will hold the display at any angle, in both tablet and laptop position, even through considerable turbulence.- Basic productivity tasks such as web browsing and document editing (via Google Docs) work well.- Overall performance is better than expected, excepting a specific issue I'll cover below.- Expandable storage via MicroSD is welcome, though some workarounds are necessary for managing the Android file system.- Android app compatibility is better than expected, with some annoyances I'll get into in a bit.- Touch and stylus input works well (though I rarely use it).- Trackpad tracks well and has the basic multi-touch features you'd expect. There are even a few configurable options to dial it into your personal preference.The In-between- Keyboard is just okay. Nothing special but perfectly functional, though a bit mushy.- Battery life is less than advertised under what I consider normal use. Not horrible; not great.- Wi-fi radio hasn't been problematic. No random connection drops but 5GHz range is lacking, even by 5GHz standards.The Bad- Display isn't bright enough for outdoor use without an anti-glare screen "protector". Dark scenes in Movie/TV media will lose considerable detail in bright environments.- Audio volume isn't loud enough for noisy environments such as an airplane, even with active noise cancelling headphones. Granted, raising the volume to maximum will mostly suffice but I find myself straining to hear dialog far too often.- No audio configuration at all. Not even a basic EQ, which would have helped offset the volume issues.- Build quality is sub-par. The bottom panel will eventually (if not immediately out of the box) start to creak with a little pressure and tightening the screws doesn't help. The "aluminum" finish easily scratches, which is not surprising considering that it's just painted plastic.- Clicking the trackpad requires more pressure than it should and is quite problematic at its edges. After 3 months of constant use, it's loosened up some, but not enough.The Ugly- Video playback will stutter badly for a few seconds every 20-30(ish) minutes during playback regardless of the source with seemingly no attributable cause. Even locally stored media exhibits this behavior, ruling out connectivity issues.- USB MIDI does not work; at all! This has been confirmed by Samsung and is a big issue for those who would use it.- The physical lock button on the side of the device causes the device to lock instantaneously and requires reentry of user credentials when unlocking. The only way around this is to not require credentials to unlock; a real no-no for travelers (more on this in the next section).- The "Full Screen Immersive" button lives on the keyboard, and as such must be disabled when in tablet position (more on this in the next section).The UX NightmareThis is a compound issue revolving around the physical lock button and full screen key. In fact, there are multiple issues here that are better conveyed through a use case so here goes...As mentioned previously, if your device is configured to require credentials upon unlocking (as well it should be), accidentally touching the lock button, perhaps to the armrest on an airline seat, means reentering your password every single time it happens. If a configuration option that is common to most mobile devices, such as a timed delay before credentials are required was available, this issue would be more tolerable. Even a delay of a few seconds would allow you to "undo", much like a Windows PC will allow you to "wiggle" the mouse as soon as the display goes black without actually going into full lock-down.Couple this with the fact that once you lock the device and subsequently unlock it, any app that was in fullscreen mode is now back in "windowed" mode (for lack of a better term). Why is this so annoying? So here's my user story; I start up Netflix to watch a movie as I'm settling in for my 4 hour flight. I use the fullscreen key while in laptop position (because that's the only time you can) then flip the display over into tablet position only to accidentally touch the lock button either with my hand or against the armrest (both easy to do on a plane in cramped quarters). Bam! Now I have to flip the display back over, type in my password, press the fullscreen key again, flip back into tablet position, etc. Frustrating!Two simple tweaks would solve everything. First, allow the user to disable the physical lock button! It's not necessary as the device can be locked from the UI. Second, persist the fullscreen state of apps. This level of UX frustration shouldn't exist on a device built by Samsung and running a Google OS.The Bottom LineThe Chromebook Plus is a good but not great device that unfortunately, has very little competition. Release channel Android compatibility is a must for myself and many other users which severely limits our options. I've been holding out hope that some of the easily correctable issues would have been addressed by now but sadly, they have not. As a result, I now consider my Chromebook Plus to be an interim solution until a better option comes along. With that in mind, it's not a bad device for the asking price but I would gladly pay more for something better.
Love my chromebook. Using it right now to write this review. Excellent battery life, Recharges quickly. Does everything I need :)
2 THINGS U MUST KNOW 1ST! 1 the screen is exactly 11" NOT 12.3 The second thing is that the keyboard does NOT have a caps lock button in its place is a search button that opens google. in order to use caps u must press both the alt and shift keys at the same time and in order to remove the caps you have to hit just the shift key and if you mistake the cap off for the caps on while the cap is already on it opens google over whatever your typing and forces you to exit the screen, I don't understand why they replaced the caps lock and didn't just add the search key somewhere else less used like the status bar but I do know that this will take a while to get used to and right now I'm struggling to type this with the correct grammar due to the annoyance of this feature. In addition to this, keyboard is exceptionally small in compassion to most 12" laptops, the delete key is half the size of the other keys and the entire screen is square not rectangle shaped the stock photo makes it look normal like a Macbook shape but it is not. So far day one the function of this computer seem t be fine no issues there. Lastly the package was poorly wrapped with all the brown paper at one side leaving the laptop in an over-sided box with brown paper on only one side.
For me as a teacher is this the best Chromebook I can have. Chrome apps and Android apps together. Pen for drawing and taking notes.It is a great tablet to. Gast, bright screen.
Very good for uni work. It does lag a bit sometimes and lately the screen has been moving without me touching it. But otherwise it's been great, no other problems.
I am so happy have this item at father's day in good price, I love Amazon gave this chance.
Boo; too slow. Returned it. Also, keyboard is not good. Perhaps the "Pro" version is better.
After 3 months will not power on. LED cycles through green, blue then flickers white/purple a couple of times. Left charging for 12 hours no change. Searching online shows several people have had the same issue, sending it in for repair appears to be the only way to get it to power back on - which is extremely frustrating given all the time wasted in trying to get it to work and lost through not having the device.Worked with a Samsung technician to try and get it to power-up - using ESC, Refresh, Power 3 key press. A flicker on the screen but no boot-up. Sending it in for repair....I advise people to NOT buy the Samsung Chromebook Plus
There is no indicate when the caplock is on
Love love love the size, weight, look and feel of product. Don't like that it's not compatible with Microsoft office software.
Product was broke on arrival. There was a note inside the package from another customer that stated the item wi-fi was not working. Therefore, I would think the item was returned previously and shipped out again with no fix.
Update 2:Ok, so I hate writing reviews. I hate updating reviews. I hate updating updated reviews. So, the fact that I'm compelled to update this review less than a year after I both bought the item and updated it the first time should say something.I would strongly advise anyone looking for a Chromebook to look elsewhere. While I stand by my assessment that Chrome OS is more than enough OS for most people and that the OS is actually surprisingly developer friendly (I'm compiling C++ on it without issue, so the OS is definitely a capable Linux system), the hardware is utter garbage.So, as I had mentioned previously, there was a phantom tap issue that was fixed in on of the updates a long time ago. Well, recently the phantom tapping started up again. So, my first thought that it was a bug like last time and that it'd go away after a few updates. However, it did not.The issue increased in frequency as the last month has gone by. I started getting concerned. Well, it turns out the wiring to the touchscreen itself is actually damaged! Fantastic! Less than a year old and I've now had to disable the touchscreen just for the system to be usable. The singular feature I actually wanted out of this has now been rendered unusable.The issues don't stop there. Since about 6 months into this adventure, this Chromebook has had nearly daily wifi issues. Generally, after about 24-48 hours of uptime, I have to restart the Chromebook, otherwise, it'll start dropping wifi at an increasing rate. It also appears that Bluetooth has entirely failed in the Chromebook and it always throws a "Cannot connect" error any time you attempt to use Wifi.Like a good Chrome OS user, I thought maybe a powerwash would fix these issues. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The issues have become so unbearable that I'm having to look for something to replace this "fantastic piece of machinery" with.Generally bad experiences stick out the most. I don't want to say all Chromebook Pluses are garbage. It's very likely I just lucked out. However, I do advise caution when choosing between this and other Chromebooks.Update:So, after giving this little bugger another week (give or take a few days), I've got to say I'm enjoying it far more than I had been that first week. I've found that popping this bad boy into the "Beta Branch" actually produces significant stability improvements. Android apps no longer crash the entire OS now, but are still in a state of near inoperability. The rest of the OS, however, has become extremely stable and hasn't crashed at all since switching branches. On top of the stability, there seems to be at the very least a small improvement to performance. Be warned, though, switching to the beta branch and then switching back to the stable branch WILL erase all of your data on the Chromebook. Keep this in mind before deciding to switch which branch you're using.I definitely think it's a worth purchasing chromebook for those willing to embrace the beta branch. For those of you who aren't as tech savvy or are only looking for Android support, I would say it's still best to hold off.Original Review:I bought this Chromebook as a replacement for an old and quickly dying laptop that had a battery no longer able to hold a charge. As a mostly PHP developer, my first thought was that I didn't need too much power for what I'm doing. If I needed anything more than what the Chromebook had, I could simply remote into my desktop using Chrome Remote Desktop and I'd be golden.I've definitely made both the right and wrong choice here. So, I'm definitely correct in assuming I don't need as much power as I went for with my last laptop. This Chromebook most definitely does everything I need it to do. I can easily browse the internet in comfort, there are plenty of SSH clients for Chrome that I can use to remote into servers, Chrome Remote Desktop works what I consider shockingly well. As well, I'm loving everything about Chrome OS's UI in comparison to Windows 10.The Bad (skip this if you're wanting to know what the pros of this device are. This section is bound to change over the next few weeks/if an update fixes the issues found):You're probably now wondering "why is this individual giving a product they clearly like a 2 out of 5 review!?" Believe me, this is not the score I want to give it. I definitely love the device. In the week I've had it, I've had an extremely pleasant experience with it for the most part. However, there are multiple issues I've encountered that, until fixed, can't allow me to give it a score above 2 stars.To start with, opening more than 3 or 4 pages with any sort of moderate javascript (here's looking at you, countless banks that seem to think you need to load up 20MB worth of javascript every time you're loaded) will cause lag, so keep this in mind "interweb power users". This is ignorable in most cases and something I expected considering this little beaut is equipped with an ARM CPU. Nothing new there, ARM CPUs aren't powerhouses, they're power savers.If you get up to the 7 to 8 range, things start to slow down and they slow down substantially. Again, this is to be expected, it's an ARM CPU. The issue here is that things also start to become unstable at that point. Multiple times now the entire OS has locked up on me, requiring a hard reboot, roughly when I hit 9 pages open.I want to reiterate, I'm well aware of the limitations of ARM CPUs. I don't expect for this to perform just as well with 9 pages open as it does with 3 or 4 pages open. What I do expect, however, is for the OS to gracefully kill processes if it feels that things are getting too overloaded. This is a common task of OSes and something OSes do without issue.As someone that frequently deals with *nix systems, I'm well aware of how well Linux (what Chromium OS and thus Chrome OS use for their kernel) can perform and how well it can handle issues that might pop up during run time. I've had a web server running BSD stay up for a little over 2 years now without hiccup or issue. *nix OSes are reliable. They're stable. Even on ARM CPUs, they're able to handle even the most abusive tasks. However, Chrome OS seems incapable of handling of this.I'm not entirely sure if this is an issue with Chrome OS itself or potentially the big.LITTLE ARM package they've opted to use for this Chromebook. While big.LITTLE has been a common steeple of the ARM CPU and mobile device arena for a very long time now (many modern Android phones use big.LITTLE ARM packages) and is supported by the Linux kernel, it's always possible that there's a hardware issue occurring when Chrome OS calls for the big (the high powered CPU) cluster to activate and take on some tasks. This could be due to a defect with my particular unit (this is something I plan to contact Samsung about and, once I've talked to them, my rating may change), or an issue with the current version of Chrome OS's handling of these situations (same as before, if an update for Chrome OS is pushed out that fixes this issue, my rating may change).Another issue I've had revolves around the trackpad. While not a "horrible" trackpad, it's definitely inferior to pretty much any trackpad I've ever used in the past. It seems to have an issue where randomly it decides I've placed 2 fingers on it even though I've only placed 1 finger on it, causing it to switch into scrolling mode. This seems to be an on and off issue, one that I thought was potentially caused by something sitting on top of the trackpad along with my finger that registered as a finger. However, when this occurs, even wiping off the trackpad doesn't fix the issue.The Good:So, with all of the negativity out of the way, here are the things I love about this Chromebook (I bet you didn't see this coming)! First off, the keyboard is extremely enjoyable to use. I'm a huge fan of chicklet keyboards and this one really takes the cake. It's quick to type on and (because I'm relatively weird as many developers are) it makes a super delightful clicky noise as the keys are tapped. I've always been a fan of the noise keys make when being pressed anyway, but this has to be one of my favorite sounding chicklet keyboards.As well, the touch screen is an absolute godsend. Everything about it is great. It's extremely responsive and feels very natural to use while derping about on websites. The Chromebook is packaged with a fairly simple (though very awesome) drawing app that takes advantage of the screen and pen's pressure sensitivity that really shows off what could be done with this device. While I'm not really an artist, I will definitely say that this app will become a common part of my weekly routine for stress relief. Something about drawing really clears the mind.Another thing I really love is the Android/Google Play Store app compatibility (I address this further down so, if you're new to Chrome OS, please read the disclaimer further down the review). I've got quite a few apps that I use very frequently on my cellphone such as Andchat (IRC app) and Timely (alarm app). These apps work almost flawlessly in Chrome OS. Timely runs in the background as one would expect, syncing up with my phone's alarms. Andchat is just as buggy as it is on Android itself (it has some issues with crashing when losing focus if it's connecting to a server) but overall is a treat of an experience when used on this Chromebook.Finally, I can't emphasize how much I love everything about the Chrome apps. Chrome itself has been my browser of choice for years now, and seeing what people can do with apps through HTML5 and Javascript through the Javascript API the OS provides (direct file access, file system access implementations such as mounting SMB shares, Dropbox accounts, Onedrive accounts, etc) is truly amazing. There's so much potential that I'm really looking forward to Chrome OS growing.The Ugly:This is separate from the rest of the review so, if you've made it this far and you have experience with Chrome OS, you're free to go!As a warning to people that want to purchase this Chromebook purely for it's Android app support, it's clearly a very early beta and the Chromium Project (the group responsible for maintaining the open sourced Chromium OS which Chrome OS derives from) explicitly mentions this fact. Do not expect all of your favorite apps to be compatible, there's a good chance they aren't. As well, do not expect all of your apps that claim to be compatible to run correctly or at all. Many of them, especially those that use OpenGL (pretty much anything with "pretty graphics"), can and will cause the Chromebook to lock up.This is bound to change in the future as the technology advances and improves, but if that's your only reason for wanting this Chromebook, you're far better off just getting an Android tablet.
love this, sadly use it more than my MacBook pro.
I wanted a light, compact, no nonsense, do what it says on the packet laptop. It's fast, efficient and a very solid machine for $500! Highly recommend
It was a gift and the recipient liked it.
This is my third Chromebook since 2013 so I'm comfortable with the ecosystem and knew what to expect from Chromebooks in general - if you haven't used a Chromebook before you should do a little research first. My review is aimed at people who may want to trade up to this more expensive device.The first surprise with the Plus is how small and light it is in comparison to my previous Samsung and Toshiba devices. This really is aimed at a more premium market and deserves the higher price given the build quality. In tablet mode the device feels a little bulkier but still works well enough. I also have a very svelte Sony Z4 tablet but now find myself reaching for the Plus as often as that Android tablet.A great feature of this device is how well the Android apps work. I was expecting them to be a bit flaky but my usual apps e.g. Flipboard work very well (I switched to the beta channel so perhaps that helped). If you're interested in the Plus or Pro you probably watched the Verge review in early Feb and are aware of the stability issues running Android apps on the Pro but this is very far from the experience with the Plus.Apart from media consumption, I use this device for small-scale development tasks on remote servers via ssh so a good keyboard is important. This is not that keyboard. The single most disappointing aspect of this device is the cramped keyboard, the small keys with very short travel. It's an unpleasant experience even typing this much. For work I use Das keyboards so I am a bit spoilt but my previous Toshiba & Samsung chromebooks had more reasonable keyboards.The screen is amazing. The screen is amazing. Repeat. You really have to see it for yourself but do believe other reviewers when they praise the stunning colours and resolution. Although I'm never going to use the included pen much, it does work well for highlighting in presentations.In tablet mode, everything works well but don't expect that the experience will be as good as a dedicated tablet like the Sony Z4. The difference is that you can hold the Z4 in one hand for extended periods without feeling the strain, something which isn't really possible with the weightier Chromebook. The Plus is more suitable to sitting down with the device propped up on your knee. Less portable but still very useful and in this mode you really appreciate that gorgeous touch screen.All in all, if you are looking for a device to use casually as a tablet and still be able to get some work done then this device will delight you. Obviously you need to know the pluses and minuses of Chromebooks in general and expect that Chrome/Android integration is not perfect but with that caveat in mind, you can expect great things from this device.As a small aside, I imported this device to Ireland and the delivery was fast with all import duties paid at the Amazon checkout. You will need a converter for the American plug but luckily I had one at home and they aren't hard to pick up elsewhere.
My best Chromebook so far.The return of the stylus remind me of the Psion an early and very reliable series in netbook.
Love the size, the light weight, but many times using the keyboard, the characters do not register. Very frustrating!
The best thing about this computer is the high quality screen - I love the rich detail. Overall, I do not like this computer. The odd sized screen makes it difficult to work in some back office programs because you can't edit some of the popup screens. The computer hardware (not intel) is very sluggish. I needed a workhorse and this computer just can't handle the amount of files I need opened at one time. Albeit, just word processing documents, but this machine is wigging out after only six months of use. It's started going through some flashing gyrations and adjusting the screen size every two seconds. Had to shut it down and let it rest. My last chromebook was an Acer C720. I loved it. It outperformed this computer when it was new by a long shot. Don't let the pretty packaging fool you. Also, this chromebook is so light that the laptop falls over when I try to type on it. I had to buy a case to hold it down so I could work on it. Also, I was disappointed with the stylus tool. Loved the fact that they have a place to store the pen. However, the only thing it writes on is the notepad. It won't write on the screen if I want to mark up documents, etc. It does work with drawing apps and of course you can use it with the touchscreen. Was expecting more. I also find that the touchscreen is not as responsive as I would like. Don't like the touch on the keyboard either. If you want a pretty machine for surfing and casual use, this is the machine for you. Otherwise, don't waste your money. I'm looking to replace this one as soon as I can.
i love it. havent been able to attach to hdmi (with a dongle ) still trying .
It's slim and light weight. Love that it has an app store and stylus. I've used Chromebooks for many years and this is the best one yet.
My first Chromebook, and it's just amazing. I barely ever use my PC anymore.
Excelent !!!!
I replaced my 6 pound i7 gaming laptop with this. Now, that's not to say this can do EVERYTHING an i7 with a gtx 1060 can do. But at two pounds and with a good 8 hours of battery life I can take it a lot more places, and do almost everything I used to do. Runs Chrome (obviously) like a champ, and will play most Android games as fast or faster than a phone or tablet. WIth full support for the Android store that also means you can run the Office apps, and more to get a little productivity in as well. Run it most often in "tent" mode when gaming, and that is more helpful than you might believe. The stylus support is als a much better deal than I had expected. It hasn't made an artist out of me, but it does make for more accurate selecting, and minimize fingerprints on the screen.
Super fast delivery all the way to Ireland. Item arrived two days early and works perfectly. Thank you!
Very satisfied with my SC Plus. Brilliant screen with 3:2 aspect ratio, built quality is very good, and keyboard is not as bad as others claim.
This chromebook does everything I needed and more. Love the play store! Plus it's blazing fast.
Itâs fantastic. I really enjoy it every day. Iâm happy to open it and to know that i make a good decision. I really like to have a chromebook plus if somebody have to update or reboot I just smile.
This seemed to be the ideal laptop for me having had a chromebook for 5 years already. in fact, I was so keen I had it shipped from Us to UK (where it is not available). It has lived up to my expectations.Pros: excellent screen streets ahead of the majority of similar chromebooks. excellent track pad rapid boot time touch screen laptop, tablet and other modesCons: not sure it is as robust as older models. I would not recommend it for a student bag for example screen sensitive to movement and I have had to reset it a couple of times to prevent screen flickering uncontrollablyAs a mature light user (internet, emails etc) it suits me perfectly. Best laptop I have ever had but think carefully about its use and how much a chromebook meets your needs before buying.This is the first time I have ever felt the urge to write a review such as this!
Pros: Decent hardware, great battery lifeCons: A few glitches: sometimes, the cursor flips upside down; sometimes, the chromebook reboots without any noticeable reason. Annnoying, but not enough to spoil the fun.
The chrome book itself is very light and nice, only issue is the metal gets scratches! I donât know how to buff it out and it makes the very pretty simple look ugly and dirty!
Love my Chromebook! Beautiful design, run fast. I use it to write and internet
The best chromebook I have ever had, Honestly
Great Chromebook and found it on sale on Amazon for less than $390. Very fast and looks beautiful.
I got this chromebook for my daughter. I have not used it, but my daughter loves it. I am happy with the purchase.
Great device. My loves it!
Works amazingly. Would recommend again. Thinking of buying a second one.
I bought it to replace a samsung notepro 12.2. And it does that very nicely indeed. I love the ability to write on the screen etc, and it is quick and very responsive.
Can charge from one USB c charger that is shared with phones. Seems to be solid. Good when travelling.Out of the Chromebooks available this is a good device.
Fast delivery was great, as my daughter was eagerly awaiting for her new chromebook. Product and experience has been great!
I love it
This is a great device for the price, but not without flaws.I still give it a 5 star review because, as with many of the video reviews out there, I've found it to be a really useful 2-in-1 to have around for games, taking notes, web operations etc. I make much more use out of the built-in pen than I thought I would, and the screen is simply superb.There is, however one oversight with their build of chromeos that will be insignificant to 90% of users, but a showstopper for the few people who want to plug in external MIDI devices for music production.PROS:Display : almost unusable for text at its native resolution, the display has a very wide viewing angle, good black levels ( to my eye ) and is very bright.Stylus pen : really handy, especially at hi-resolutions. Art programs are fun2-in-1 : At less than 2.5lb, feasible to use in tablet mode. Tent, vertical and other modes are handy.keyboard : decent travel, small backspace button, but you get used to that pretty quicklyAndroid on-board : some issues with some applications, but overall a good experience.Snappy performance: Not driven this too hard but performs well for regular use.CONS:- speakers are pretty meh, but I guess that's to be expected; I don't use it to listen to anything- Bluetooth connectivity seems iffy .. they might have not implemented everything perfectly- USB MIDI Does Not Work, period. I've spent a lot of email and phone time with them to convince them to check this out, but Chromeos does support MIDI over USB and the samsung engineers dropped the ball on this one. I've verified MIDI initializes and works on other chromeOS devices, but this one looks like it's missing the drivers or they simply didn't build in the midi libraries. MIDI fails to get past initialization on this device. I escalated the issue as far as I could and eventually convinced the support person to try to get the bug in front of an engineer, but we'll have to wait and see if they fix it. If they do, and make the 14 of us who actually want to use it for midi happy , I'll update this review.OK UPDATE ( 5/17/17 ) : still no fix for midi; samsung cs dropped the ticket, as far as I can tell. Still love the chromebook for other tasks, but I'm dropping a star cos they didn't build the os to spec... and I'm in a petty mood.
With all the hype out of C2E2 about the Chromebook Plus (and its big sister, the Chromebook Pro coming out in April) being THE Chromebook for the next generation, I decided to pre-order it on Amazon. Now having played around with it for a few weeks, I can say that despite some of the hiccups, I find the Chromebook Plus a great productivity tool, and provided Google follows through with its updates to Chrome OS, could very well live up to the hype. Keyword: COULD.NOTE - This is my first Chromebook, so other than the stylus, I don't know if the other qualities are common among other Chomebooks or are unique to the Chomebook Plus.WHAT I WAS LOOKING FORI was looking to replace my Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241, which has served me well, but wasn't quite meeting my goals. I am a private & online tutor, so I needed a productivity machine that met the following criteria:1) Boots quickly.After logging in, loading Windows Vista, anti-virus, anti-malware, & VPN, my old Toshiba would take a good 90-seconds from Power button to user ready. Then add 15 seconds to find the proper file for my student, that amount of waiting was simply not going to cut it.2) Responsive touchscreen & quality stylus.If you can live without a stylus, then definitely look elsewhere, as you can easily find Chomebooks of comparable quality for +$100 cheaper. But I use a web whiteboard for my tutoring sessions, so a responsive, accurate stylus was essential. I resorted to a Huion tablet accessory for my Toshiba, but I was getting tired of constantly plugging in hardware, so I wanted to shell out extra for a built-in stylus.3) Access to Google Play apps.This was supposed to be THE game changer. Without the apps, Chromebooks were glorified web browsers, but with the apps, they would elevate Chromebooks to the perfect blend of laptop power & mobile responsiveness. And as a Google fanboy, anything that could make the Google ecosystem feel seamless was my kind of machine.CHOOSING THE PLUSSo with those goals in mind, three products seemed like good candidates: the Chromebook Plus, the Asus C302CA-DHM4 12.5-in touchscreen, & the Surface Pro 4. The Chromebook Plus was the only product to fit all those goals; the Asus lacked a stylus, & the Surface Pro did not have access to Google Play apps (though to be fair, the main reason I didn't go with the Surface Pro was, despite being a superior machine in most respects, the base model was $779 without the keyboard, a $329 premium to the $449 Plus which included a keyboard, not-backlit, but still...).THE REVIEWSo my choice secured, does the Plus live up to expectations?1) Boots quickly?Emphatically YES!Upon touching the power button, the login screen loads within 5 seconds. While I would have liked the Plus to support biometric logins like fingerprinting or facial recognition (like the Surface Pro's Windows Hello), Chrome OS includes a Smart Lock option that will unlock your Plus if your local Android phone is unlocked. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that supports fingerprint scanning, so with a swipe I can unlock my Note 4, which then unlocks my Plus. Total time from power up to user-ready: less than 10 seconds.2) Responsive touchscreen & quality stylus?Touchscreen, yes. Stylus, mostly.For folks concerned about the responsiveness of the ARM chip, fear not. The Plus is lightning quick, and I havenât had problems with the touchscreen (though I'm the type to have less than 10 tabs open & maybe two apps on at a time, so you might require more horsepower than I do).As for the stylus, itâs a good piece of hardware. Itâs not the S-Pen of Galaxy Note 4 fame, but it makes saving screenshots & taking notes a breeze. When using it on my web whiteboard, there is a slight lag, maybe a few milliseconds. Nothing terrible, but writing doesnât quite feel as seamless as I wouldâve liked.3) Access to Google Play apps?Itâs a mixed bag.Iâm willing to give the Plus the benefit of the doubt here, as many of the apps on Play are designed for smartphones & not tablets, so many of the apps just feel awkward. I play Lichess, and while the game plays fine, the text still stays mobile-sized, making the app feel like vast stretches of the plains; it just goes on forever. I also use the Skype app, but when the video screen docks you canât move or resize it, which can be annoying if it blocks a tab you need on Chrome. I also just recently had some issues with Skype freezing. Despite the problems with apps, Google redesigned the web interfaces for Drive, Docs, Sheets, & Voice such that Google specific apps arenât really necessary.Another quirk is that, unlike the Chrome web browser, Android app windows canât be manually resized. You only get two choices: standard window, or full-screen. This is supposed to be corrected with the update to Android 7 Nougat, so maybe Iâll change my tune when it comes out. But Play Store experience certainly feels like a Beta, so expect some hiccups.MISCELLANEOUS - DESIGNI do like the design of the chassis, though it has already accumulated some minor scratches on the undercarriage. I had to get used to the more compact keyboard & the smaller DEL & TAB keys, and Google stealthily replaced the traditional Caps Lock key with a Search key, so I had to go into settings to change its function back. As a tablet it feels awkward with the keyboard facing the back, but it feels sturdy, so Iâm willing to make that tradeoff.SPEAKERSI love watching YouTube videos, though out of several hours of YouTube viewing, on three occasions the speakers developed a crackle or sizzle for 5-7 seconds. I was a bit concerned about this, but the last occurrence was about 10 days ago. Iâm not much of an audiophile, but if this does become bothersome, I will update my review accordingly.BLUETOOTHI occasionally use Bluetooth headphones, & while I have no problems with connection during video playback, it will disconnect after a minute of silence (without you knowing, by the way).THE VERDICT - GETS THE JOB DONE, THOUGH STILL A WORK IN PROGRESSOverall, Iâm very happy with my purchase. Itâs responsive, boots fast, & maximizes the Google experience that few products can replicate. Itâs not perfect by any means, but sometimes thatâs the price of novelty. If you're looking for a basic Chromebook who doesnât need a stylus or Google Play access, at the Plus will seem overpriced. But in comparison to tablet-hybrids with a stylus like the $779 bare-bones Surface Pro or the $799 12.9-in iPad Pro, the Plus, at $449, while imperfect, is still a tremendous value.
Outstanding except cannnot figure out how to connect to printer
Trackpad has a little bit of play in other than that great.
I honestly thought that it would come with problems on the contrary it didn"t and my laptop works great.
Awesome product, beyond expectations! Great display, long battery life, surprisingly crisp performance and very lightweight. Plus, Android apps!This is an exceptional value for the money.Good choice of connections (two USB-C ports which you can use for everything, including connecting a second display, and a Micro-SD reader).To be very, very picky, wi-fi reception could be better when signal is very low and Andoid support still has some rough edges but this depends on ChromeOS itself and will surely be fixed in time.Very nice pen subsystem: its shows that Samsung has matured a long experience in this field.I totally recommend this product which has made me forget my Windows 10 ultrabook.
Awesome 2 in 1 laptop. Operates very smooth. I wanted a laptop that could be multi purpose compared to my MacBook, and I find myself having a better time using the Chromebook, only downside is that it does have speakers at the bottom but does have a Bluetooth feature for connecting your headphones which I prefer. The response from the track pen to the screen is great, the LED screen is vibrant and very high quality. Very light and great quality build. I've seen people complain about the note taking that comes built in for the pen, just download Squid and make it default and it operates much better, then what comes pre default. As an Apple product guy this laptop far exceeded my expectations.
Great portable lap top!
First let me say that I love Chromebooks in general. I have owned several of them: Acers, an earlier Samsung, Toshiba, etc. It's a wonderful platform and I recommend them highly. However, the Samsung Plus has been the worst of all of the Chromebooks that I have owned, unfortunately.It has been the most troublesome, from a hardware standpoint, compared to any of the earlier Chromebooks. It crashes regularly; at least once a day. It just shuts off and reboots. While rebooting itself is fairly quick, it takes a long time to reload my Chrome tabs. The shutdowns seem to be random: at one point if I close a tab it will crash, at another point if I just click on web page it will crash. It does run apps okay, some better than others of course, but in general I have not found the apps to be incredibly useful. The native capabilities of a Chromebook are good enough to where the apps are not something that I find incredibly useful so far. The other thing that I find annoying is the flip part of this design. Yes, you can make it tent, or make it be in tablet mode, but there is really no good place to hold the computer while doing this. If you try and grasp it by one of the upper corners you can close the Chrome browser, which is very irritating because you have to reboot the computer to get your tabs back; if you just reopen the Chrome browser you're presented with a blank tab and all of your previously open tabs, while in history, are no longer displayed. Also, when in tablet mode if you try to pick up the computer or grasp it you have to pretty much touch the screen, which can cause all sorts of unintended havoc. So for the next Chromebook that I get I think that I will forgo the flip part of the design because it really doesn't add that much and can make the computer very irritating to operate. Also I find that the computer is not particularly fast. I realize that part of this is that I don't have a broadband connection, just an ADSL connection, so it may be better if you are connected to a much faster service provider than I'm able to acquire. I do like the the precision of the pen and think itâs one of the best things about this model. The metal case looks nice and âpremiumâ?when new, but it does dent rather than just deflect like the plastic cases do, so that it looks a bit beat up after just a couple of months.Overall I do not think that this is quite ready for primetime, at least not for me. The premium cost is not really justified in my situation and I rather regret this purchase.
Nice, but the monitor flickering at lower light level
kids love it!
Does everything it says it will what more can you ask.
I love the slim & light weight design. It's very easy to take on the go. ð
The keyboard build quality and the idea to have speaker on the back is something I don't like. Other than that, everything is great
My second Chromebook - My son is using it now.
Im in love with this laptop!!
this is a better laptop than any of the windows laptops i have used costing more than twice as much. if one does not really need to run windows programs, this is the way to go. there is an ap for this for almost everything i used to do on windows.the only problem i have had is buggy trackpad driver that occasionally goes berserk and causes screen to jump around. a quick reboot has always solved the problem. i am hoping a future driver update completely fixes trackpad problem.i love the bright high res screen. built in pen works well. boots fast. i love this.
Second one purchased and second one with a defective screen. Total waste of money and time.
this works great for my purpose whish is just browsing the internet
Like others have stated I immediately had trouble with the speakers . The device ran very smooth and looks great just couldn't see spending so much money on something that was broken on day 1 so I returned it.
Having waited for this since 2016, the Samsung Chromebook Plus has comfortably lived up to astronomical expectations - replacing both my ipad and laptop and doing a better job of both. I am new to Chrome OS but I can tell you now it's going to take something special to pull me away.Pros:- Browsing is quick and light- it takes about 6 seconds to switch on and 3 seconds to log in. While this is much more than a Chromebook, it certainly isn't less than a Chromebook. (I'm also a sucker for Chrome OS keyboard shortcuts.)- Android apps: I love how well it syncs with my phone - whatsapp, wunderlist, google books, google docs, spotify, youtube.. can all be put down on one and picked up on the other without going through finnicky browser copies.- Screen: i) Aspect Ratio ii) Definition iii) Touchscreen. i) 3 x 2 is preferred for browsing - makes much more sense for web pages and far better for tablet experience - read ebooks and edit pages comfortably in portrait mode. And I don't feel it when I watch videos. ii) Screen is super crisp and really nice for watching videos and viewing pictures on. Need to see it to understand. iii) Touchscreen/trackpad combo is a winner - only one is a bit frustrating sometimes, having the functionality of both is ideal.- Battery life: Kills it. 10 hours if you try, 8 if you don't. Charges in about 2 hours.- Super light and thin (I can't even tell if it's in my bag or not), comfortably light enough to hold, and very very thin- thinner than my ipad and case!- Convertible: As well as the obvious bonuses of this, I feel not enough has been said about tucking the keys under the screen with the screen at 45 degrees and the keys like a stand on your lap- really nice for skype, videos, and really comfortable to scroll through pages. The other good thing is it can do every angle so you don't have to adjust your seating based on how the stand as I used to with an iPad, you can just tilt the screen differently and not have to hold it at the angle you want. This is also ideal when combined with how thin it is - because the screen by itself is thinner than any tablet.- No viruses at all- Stylus works really well with palm rejection, looking forward to Google Keep being improved as we go.Things other people have complained about I haven't found to be issues:- Speakers: crackling once or twice in 2 months but quickly fixed but turning the volume town or moving the laptop, nothing worse than having it near a magnet or something- Android apps: Only one I use that doesn't size properly. A bit of screen flashing once or twice, but nothing more than rebooting the app needed. Expecting this to be all good when the pro comes out in April- Processor speed: never felt slow bothered me, can't see why you'd need a pro, just close tabs / apps you're not using - easy to do when you can reopen them so quickly.- No backlit keyboard: People, it's 2017, how are you still looking at the keys? Also, are you also 15 trying to stay up without your parents knowing? The brightness from the screen is plenty for any setting I'd say, even if you can't touch-type.Who should buy this?Anyone who wants something for entertainment and personal use that's well built, portable and fast. This is the mother of all notebooks, as light as a feather without a bloated or tablet operating system, perfect for anything you'd do at home or in a coffee shop.This also works very well as a 3rd device or a laptop for kids/teenagers (especially with the stylus).Who shouldn't buy this?- Video editors - probably need a more developed operating system- People who need some special apple/microsoft only programme (eg iMessage, Garage Band or people who can only code in VBA)P.S. Good tip: I've really benefited from having a phone I can turn into a wi-fi router and a good amount of 4G internet on my contract. Worth getting if you want to use this on the go a lot.PPS Ordered to the UK and works well - just need to get a plug adaptor and get used to ",@, Â£,# switching around.
I really liked that it's sleek, looks great. I don't like that it won't print
Good but could do better. The ChromeOS is constantly evolving which is great and the app store means there is really no need for android tablets anymore. My only complaint would be the cramp cheap feeling keyboard and track pad. The lack of back lighting is not usually an issue as the letters are reflective and the amazing screen illuminates them. Google play out of the box is a welcome addition to ChromeOS and i found it worked well. I didn't notice too many laggy moments apart from under heavy work load with multiple apps and tabs open. The op1 SOC works very well for everyday tasks. I haven't ran and MS office apps on this yet so can't comment. If you can hold out for the pro model do it but then there is talkâ?of Microsoft planning to create Windows 10 for ARM. Exciting times. Great device for the price.
I'm switching from windows after using Android for a while. I really like the laptop version. The tablet version is not exactly the same as an Android Tablet. No complaints overall though
beautiful computer, fast and easy to use, light weight.
Wonderful Chromebook. Stylus pen works smoothly. Look and Feel is great. Love it.
I love my new Chromebook. It's lightweight, the battery lasts a long time and the tablet feature is awesome. I love the very responsive touchscreen, too. I did buy a mouse for it, but I had to get one that was bluetooth connected only since there are no usb ports on this Chromebook. Other than that, it's great!
My first impressions where Wow, woa & WoW! But then I was shocked when I noticed the device would simply shut down if I put it on its side. Don't get me wrong It is really sharp looking and seems fast. It has a slick looking responsive touchscreen that is about the size of a regular piece of paper and nice contours. I thought to myself this can basically do everything I need. Sure I would have to "adapt" to the samsung power chord and adjust to doing all my work via apps and the cloud but that seemed kind of exciting. And, my first doodles with the s-pen weren't worth saving though I looked forward to the many drawing sessions I dreamed of. Unfortunately the beautiful device that my samsung chromebook is, it still has an issue with turning off when on its side in tablet mode. It whites out and turns off if I simply set it up right on it's side. So, I am once again heartbroken by a samsung product, like the note 7, That had everything I needed but one crucial part and now I am left without an option other than to buy from another manufacturer once again.
Itâs was brand new and perfect
Very functional!
Simply a worry free, great device
Love it so far
least is music options
Good with play store support
Absolutely worth every penny, even the express shipping because I couldn't wait for it anymore. The keyboard feels caresses your fingers as you type on it, I've watched so many reviews about this chromebook, it's amazing to actually have one. I love it, yes it's not like the usual Microsoft computer and using Word and Onenote on the chromebook requires a little getting used to, it allows me to write down the main part of the text on my samsung and then when I'm at school I send my notes to the proper terminal.2 USB - C (Sweet Baby Jesus) I bought a SATA / USB-C adapter, then salvaged my old laptop took out the 250 gb hard-drive. Who needs a Chromebook Pro when the Chromebook plus can do so much.
Compact, boots super fast, great screen, long battery life. Love it!
Nice screen and fast shipment
Loving this laptop, it does everything i need,
I had an old Samsung 5 550 and this is the newest version of that with many new features. The quality of the display is great and for the most part all the features I had on my old Chromebook work great.So far the tablet features are not very usable for me. The tablet seems to lag a lot when using the pen and scrolling g webpages is laggy as well I'm tablet mode. I don't use these features in general so it doesn't really matter much to me.The Android apps I tested seemed to run well. So this is why I gave it 4 stars.I suspect this will improve with updates over time.
The screen is (something like) 4:3. This is a quad HD display so really high definition. Some keys are rather small. Not as thin as a MacBook Air but great little laptop for the price.Update Sept 22nd 2017: I love this device. It can run Android Play Store Apps, so for example I get Skype chat notifications, etc. Works great. Really happy with it. The keys in the keyboard are smaller compared to a full keyboard but still does the job.
very good!
I love this chromebook.
I have been using this Chromebook for 3 weeks now and really like the vivid screen and its potential. However, almost everyday, it would "bog down" and freeze between apps. Also, the screen sometimes would not allow me to "touch" and move on like on a tablet or iPhone. Unfortunately, for close to $400, its too flaky for my use.
Amazing. Best chromebook for the money
Not sure what it is, but every single convertible device I buy doesn't seem to work. Maybe it is a sign that I should consider laptops and tablets as being "un-joinable". It seemed to get confused when switching from laptop to tablet mode. I have previously tried the Asus chromebook flip twice. This makes 3 times I've turned in this sort of device as not ready for prime time. I'll try again in a few years. I did like the fanless design and it in laptop mode; but the tablet mode was mediocre IMHO. That said - maybe there was some hardware problem with all 3 of these devices since I bought some of them from amazon warehouse. Hopefully you will have better luck than me.
It's a very nice laptop. But it's smaller than I was expecting. High quality build and fast. Screen is very nice and bright and sharp HOWEVER, if you adjust the resolution the letters become grainy. The screen comes preset at 1200x800 which is said to be (BEST) according to the setting. But for me it felt like everything was too large and I was loosing screen real estate for an already small screen. So when I adjusted the resolution to 1350 x900, the fonts and overall screen felt like a better size. But that's when you'll see imperfections in the letters. What I mean is if I were to type this: IIIIIIIIIIII I would see a few of those letters have a pixel out of place so it's not a smooth letter, if that makes sense. And I'll notice that on every few letters. I do a lot of emails so it gets annoying. I thought it was a hardware issue so thank god for great service by Amazon, got a new one in the mail within 2 days and same issue, so I think it's just an issue with the screen itself. So I found a work around and which I just reduced the "Page Zoom" to 90% and it's fine. But other than this issue, it's a good chromebook. I've owned 2 other chromebooks prior to this one, both HPs and they're no where near this quality.
I'm a first time Chromebook user. Much better experience than I expected. Fast, intuitive, easy to learn.
Good performance, just as expected. The S-pen works great, the touch screen is very nice. Great for entertainment not for having just this one as your work laptop. Use it as a backup or as portable lighter laptop.
I bought this product a few months ago and I really regret it. I have not been able to find a printer that works with it. Bluetooth does not work reliably at all so it cannot connect to a bluetooth mouse or keyboard in any practical sense. And, it is very hard to find a mouse or keyboard with the UBC c port that it has (only two of). It claims to be able to support Android apps but it is really hard to get it to work at all and then the apps it has are really just junk. It is also really sensitive to slight, accidental taps on keys that send this thing flying off into the unknown with little hope of getting back to what you were working on. A daily nightmare.
What an awesome chromebook! I was slightly disappointed with the screen size but when I started using it....I forgot all about that. It is fast and the screen quality is beautiful. I love the touch screen. What a great purchase. My family is super jealous!
This is my second chromebook, and I love it. Super light, high-resolution (2k 'retina')display in 2/3 dimensions for better web page viewing and a great tablet configuration. This is the Chromebook perfection I have been waiting for with android installed natively. I'm looking forward to where these chromebook/tablets are going to go. Right now, nothing does this better on this platform. I'm looking forward to a slightly better camera. It serves its purpose but if you want to do hd conference calls or webcasts you will still need to get a decent clip on camera. The wide angle of this camera is unappealing, this is matched with poor ISO performance and a really contrasty image. Other than that, this is a pretty slick device and is great for showing off work to your clients and stakeholders.
Having read many good reviews on this i bought it. Have to say i'm not 100% happy that i did. The screen has started to jump like its good a mind of its own with someone else controlling the touchpad. It takes ages to connect to the WIFI, even in sleep mode it disconnects then you have to wait for it to reconnect.
My first Chromebook. Works great. Love the touch screen. Is a tablet & notebook. Does both well. Good build quality. Android apps run well. Get the best of a phone, tablet & laptop rolled up into 1.
This is top quality build under $500. The screen is amazing.Battery life has been good, like most chromebooks we've had.The size and form factor is exactly what my wife and I like most about this device---its perfect for our browsing / non typing lifestyle.Most android apps work OK, but not all are working quite right.The speakers seem like an after thought. Depending on how you are using it, you likely will be disappointed.But the worst is the bluetooth. Samsung knows its an issue---but they still haven't fixed it. If you use bluetooth headphones quite a bit, this device will likely drive you crazy!
I guess the "phantom touch" thing wasnt just me. The first one i bought would spaz out when i folded it in half just about every time, so a week later i sent it to have it replaced. The second one seemed to work nice, for a while till the "phantom touches" came back but this time my laptop wasn't folded in half like the first laptop..This is very bad considering I had finals and lots of essay I couldn't write or had to wait for these spazes to stop. Really annoying. Wont be buying again.
The new 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Touchscreen Laptop represents the next phase in the evolution of computing devices based on the Chrome Operating System. This Samsung Chromebook Plus is definitely a five-star computer for any individual who would regularly use both its laptop and tablet modes, who would benefit from the more vertically-oriented and webpage-accommodating 3:2 aspect ratio of its display, who would regularly use its built-in pen as an adjunctive input device, and who would regularly utilize its out-of-the-box accessibility of Android Applications. However, it should be noted, that some reviewers have deducted one or more stars for its somewhat cramped and non-tactile keyboard, its lack of keyboard backlighting at this mid-level price point, its less than rich and robust speakers, and the inevitable glitches in the functionality of the newly-integrated Android Applications in a Chrome OS device. But, to be fair, these areas of concern are highly subjective, and they do not actually detract from the overall computing experience of most users. Other than the exciting prospect of having Android Applications readily available as soon as the Samsung Chromebook Plus is set up, its absolutely bright (400-nits), crisp (234 pixels-per-inch), and beautiful touch-enabled 2400x1600p Quad-HD IPS display, is widely considered to be its premier feature. In fact, the 400-nit display of the Samsung Chromebook Plus is so bright, and it lights up the keyboard so effectively, that the quality of the computing experience is not appreciably lessened by the lack of keyboard backlighting. Of course, for most Chromebook users, the quality of the overall computing experience is largely determined by the power and performance of the processor. This 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus unit is powered by the ARM-based 2.0GHz Hexa-Core OP1 processor, with the big.LITTLE configuration, consisting of Dual Cortex-A72 Cores, along with Quad Cortex-A53 Cores. The smaller, less powerful, and less power-consuming Cortex-A53 Cores handle routine computing tasks, whereas the larger, more powerful, and more power-consuming Cortex-A72 Cores are only activated by the operating system when they are required for a more demanding workload. This big.LITTLE power optimization technology facilitates excellent energy efficiency, which results in lengthy battery life and run time. The ARM-based 2.0GHz Hexa-Core OP1 processor, which powers the Samsung Chromebook Plus, provides sufficient capability and performance for mainstream day-to-day productivity and entertainment activities, and can support all but the most extreme levels of multitasking, without noticeable lagging or hesitation. In addition, it renders webpages rapidly, and it provides for smooth scrolling and navigation on content-rich and graphics-heavy websites. For those users who require more capability and performance, it would be prudent to wait for the availability of the Samsung Chromebook Pro, which is almost identical to the Samsung Chromebook Plus, except for the fact that it is equipped with a more powerful Intel Core m3-6Y30 mobile processor. Regarding the other essential characteristics and components of this 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus device, it features an understated and elegant platinum silver design, ultra-thin (0.55-inch) and ultra-light (2.4 pounds) aluminum unibody construction, 4GB of system memory, 32GB of eMMC flash storage, two USB-C connectivity ports, one conveniently situated on either side of the device, each with a 5Gbps data transfer rate, a micro-SD card slot, a combined audio jack, 802.11a/c WiFi capability, 2x2 wireless LAN, Bluetooth 4.0, and 4K display out. The battery life of the Samsung Chromebook Plus is approximately eight hours for combined productivity and entertainment activities, which is impressive, considering the increased power requirements of its exceedingly high-resolution display. For users who absolutely must have a backlit keyboard, and who would have little need for Android Applications or a built-in pen, there are other more suitable mid-level Chromebooks that are currently available. However, this new Samsung Chromebook Plus model would be ideal for any Chromebook user for whom a bright, vibrant, and high-resolution display is a priority, for whom its mobile ARM-based processor would provide sufficient power and performance, who regularly utilizes Android Applications, who would regularly utilize its built-in pen for note-taking, drawing, and other forms of input, and whose workflow would not be compromised by its somewhat non-tactile and non-backlit keyboard. In conclusion, this new 12.3-Inch Samsung Chromebook Plus Touchscreen Laptop is an outstanding convertible computer, and it has enough superb features and components to merit a five-star rating, along with a very enthusiastic recommendation.
Like many other reviews already.. i suffer a lot of sporadic ghost touches. When tilt or touch the screen it starts go into flickering and ghost touches.. after a restart it works again until I touch the screen again..Total product failure and Samsuck is not recalling or offering a replacement.. and I won't send it for repair and waste 4 weeks and experience a broken unit again like others didWhat a shame samsuck!
I really enjoyed this laptop. My only compliant is that you cannot use Office which is super inconvenient for students. Otherwise sleek design .
Iâll start by saying that the Samsung chromebook plus is a great product and I would definitely recommend it. However, I was very disappointed when I received my package and found that the seal was broken and the product itself shows signs of wear, clearly this is not a new product as described. It may just be that it was a display model, but I ordered brand new and got used. I would avoid these sellers if possible
Bought it for a friend in need. He loves it. He can get lots of work done, fast and efficiently.
I have used this droid for nearly months now and still happy with it. And when i compare it with my mi*****ft surf*ce that cost 3x more expensive it is certainly worth it.cons: the keyboard feels cheap, but its better than nothing!I cannot redeem the google perks that come with the device because my IP is outside US.the bottom side of the chasing easily got scratchespro: very long battery life about 7hours.can download android apps.the monitor is crystal clear and it is touch screen! altough the touch screen is not so responsive if I zoom in the screen.stylus pen!!
I would give 5 stars to the hardware but the OS still have lot of bugs right click on web pages is not working at all and I have to do it from touch screen just like on a tab or mobile as most if not all detect this laptop as a mobile or a tab. Hope they will fix these issues with future OS upgrades.Pros: lovely screen, works very fast, long barry life, small size.Cons: poor paint work (very very easily gets stretch marks) , poor hinge (when you touch screen is shaking making it hard to work with), poor keyboard ( feels like you are typing on a toy laptop), no way to insert a SIM card like on other chromebooks.
The only thing I wish this Chromebook had would be a backlit keyboard. Other than that, this Chromebook is everything I need it to be.
While the volume could have been a little louder out of the box, a quick download of a volume booster app solved that problem. The stylus is very responsive, the screen is vibrant, and it runs smoothly without any real issues. It was a great replacement for my old Windows laptop.
Love this chrome book! Lost it the day after I got it because my daughter uses it for school. Her school-given chrome book is the size and weight of a large text book.
I love this machine! Nice blend between tablet and laptop. Super fast on star up. The attached pen is fantastic, and is really useful for navigating web pages. Perfect for casual use when I am away from my desk, where I use a standard desktop.
Juste top-produit que l'on ne trouve pas en France ... J'ai un ami qui en possÃ¨de 1 et je suis tombÃ©e sous le charme de cet ordi !!! Je suis ravie de l'avoir, mÃªme si j'avais un peu peur de le commander aux Etats Unis !!! ArrivÃ© avant la date, c'est juste un produit qui me correspond !!! Plus de papiers qui traÃ®nent partout ... tout est notÃ© dedans, c'est vraiment mon assistant. Je recommande vraiment, lÃ©ger, pratique,rapide, fonctionnel.. et encore je ne maÃ®trise pas encore toutes les fonctionnalitÃ©s !!! DÃ©solÃ©e pour le post en FranÃ§ais...
Do not buy. This has been a nightmare. The screen flutters wildly as if responding to input. I contacted Samsung and they said I must contact Amazon, which sent me to Samsung. Awful.
Only had this thing for a couple of weeks, but this is a generally a terrific machine.The good: Good size and weight, beautiful screen, good performance, plus the ability to use as a tablet with a pen. Battery life is also good and the Android support is very useful.The indifferent: The default pen option is Google Keep and the pen is noticeably laggy. However it's fine on something like Squib.The bad. Keyboard is mushy. Speakers aren't particularly loud.But, keyboard apart, highly recommended.
This is my first Chromebook and I love it. I'd been looking at them for a long time, but really wanted a little more functionality than they contained. Once they got Android apps, that clinched it for me. Once I started looking, this was the clear winner because of the build quality and beautiful screen. I really wanted to avoid the typical plastic-y and cheap feeling Chromebook and this does a great job of avoiding that.Of course, this is a Chromebook and I wouldn't be able to use it as my only device, but it makes a great addition to my desktop. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a laptop replacement if it was my only computing device. Also, the keyboard is decent but it's definitely more of a tablet replacement than laptop replacement because there's no way I'd want to type more than a few paragraphs at a time on it.
Problems with the wifi, keeps dropping.. and needs to be restarted to reestablish connection.
Good device, but not for everyone.To start off, it runs chrome OS, obviously, with the first integration of the playstore. My current internet had trouble connecting but thats hard to tell if thats just my bad internet or something with the device itself. It ran videos smooth and they looked amazing on the high resolution display, so i can definitely offer this a media consumption device, but at a near $500 you look for more. I tried gaming with some android games which for the most part ran smooth and without any hiccups however the touchscreen isn't optimal and it has a lot of resistance when trying to slide your thumb on it, which felt rough and frankly uncomfortable. Typing on this keyboard felt good and i found myself typing up to speed in no time. It has very good travel and a nice curve. Typing documents or essays on this thing would be incredibly doable. The main reason i got this unit was for the built in stylus, which being a samsung galaxy note user for years, caught my eye. It was a good size for me personally, about medium sized hands, and it was comfortable to draw with. Unfortunately most drawing apps didnt have a palm rejection and neither does the chromebook, so when i would rest my hand on the device it would usually start drawing where my hand touched as well. Otherwise it was good to draw with. I sought for a way to get linux or windows on this device but unfortunately it uses an arm chipset, which until later this year when microsoft comes out with a new arm windows that can emulate full software, chrome os is all you'll get.Overall the device was nice, felt good to hold in the hands and a crisp display. As a secondary media consumption or document writer it makes sense. If you are looking for something to do a bit more, look at other options that can fit your budget, at the end of the day, the limitations of chrome os are too great to keep this as an everyday driver.
Major problem with the touch screen. Uncontrolled phantom cursor movement renders this device unusable. Very disappointed after using great Chromebooks previously.
Stopped working out the blue.
I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas She loved it. I have one from work and I have enjoyed mine. My two star rating comes from my experience with Samsung customer service. My daughter took her Chromebook out of the case, opened it and watched the screen shatter in front of her. She had used it for 1 month. 1. Single. Month. It was not dropped, misused, or abused. It was kept in a protective case and cosmetically pristine. I contacted Samsung customer service thinking that the screen would never be covered under the warranty and was trying to discern if it was worth it to repair. After chatting with the customer service rep and telling him several times that the screen shattered upon opening the book, he assured me it would be covered by Samsung's 12-month warranty. Fast-forward a week letter and I am told that it would cost $440 to repair (I paid $339). I then contacted customer service again, was told that it was not under warranty even though I had been misled (I included a copy of the chat transcript that was emailed to me by Samsung) and this was the response: "Samsung does strive to produce quality products and provide best (sic) service. However, your experience did not reflect this. Here at Samsung we want to provide our customers with the best solution possible and we try to exhaust all possible resources and channels." This made me believe that they would offer something to rectify the situation. However, this was the response I received: "As the screen of the Chromebook has a physical crack, I'm afraid you'll be charged for the repair as per the warranty guidelines. I certainly would have helped you, had any alternative or option been available to me." I do not believe that Samsung had no other option. They chose not to have another option. So choose wisely. I will be choosing another brand.
i am using it to type this review.it is all about buying what you need. this is no super computer. i am buying this for my daughter school work and this is more than enough to get things done.it is speedy and friendly to use. it can install her favorite mobile games and play on it.the screen is fantastic! it is much better than a lot of the Windows laptop out there. of course there will be equivalent windows laptop with great screens, and the price would not be at this same price point.Samsung is the other brand that i trust other than Apple. although Note 7 incident is bad, but generally Samsung make good devices with quality finishes.1 cons : Microsoft makes their office app suite not available to Chromebooks. Yes, you can use the online version, but it is slow. i think they know people who are still using a Windows either:1) corporate - no choice2) Microsoft Office (again the other equivalents are getting on par; like Pages,Keynote,Numbers...and Google need to refine their Google docs,sheets and slide app)3) certain apps still work better in Windows environment (again this is changing)
Great laptop but makes weird electrical sounds every couple days. Considering this is samsung, I hope it's not a problem with the battery. This would also be a great laptop if it came with a Windows as there are no windows laptops with this screen resolution/aspect ratio. Trackpad could be a little bigger and more responsive, but it's not bad.
Great laptop if you only do browsing. I bought a SD card to extend the offline capability.At first I thought the pen was useless but the experience is actually great and it does fill like writing on paper.I'm amazed by how fast and silent it is !
It makes an excellent light-weight lap-top.The only snag so far is the difficulty in accessing the SD card, but I expect to solve that by adding Debian Linux eventually and reports indicate that it then will rival Apple machines costing twice the price.
Meet expectations.
Hands down best Chromebook out there at this time at this price point.
Up to now I have no complaints.I will supply more feedback later.Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Touch Laptop (XE513C24-K01US)
Really outstanding product. The best laptop I've ever used.
We love it good price fast delivery
This is my second Chromebook. I really love it.Everything is awesome. I have nothing to complaint except for the battery. Mine can only last about 5 hours to 6 hours ( on 40-50% brightness) and I don't do much thing, just live video and some surfing.Good but battery life need to be improved.
Awesome product. Love it! And the software experience will only continue to get better. In Google I trust! Haha.
I love my Chromebook!
Love this laptop/chromebook. Very fast and useable. Much easier to use than a pad,
2 days after return period ended, the screen started flickering. Not great to only have a product that lasts for a couple of months...
I got my item today. But someone's finger prints are all over on the screen and someone used this before i got.
If you are in the market for a super-sized version of your Android Galaxy phone look no further
The proccessor is a bit slow and has trouble streaming HD video at times. I would recomend the Pro version for a bit more.
Really really awesome! But if you're ordering from US and not in US remember you're going to get a charger that isn't compatible with your ports.
Excellent for net, work and entertainment. The pen is very useful for drawing. Quick boot, smooth. Build quality is great.
So far so great! the tablet function is really good. Huge fan of Chrome OS and this hybrid is wonderful.
*No usb portsOther is ok
Well, writing this is not easy for me.Somehow i really like my Samsung Chromebook Plus, but it's really suffering from it's slow processor.Even while typing in google docs you will recognize some stutter or hicups, it become more worse if you insert a picture and try to write around it. I can write pretty fast and there is noticable lag between the key i press and when it appears on the screen.Switching between some apps also shows serious framerate issues.The screen is just amazing, the keyboard is ok, the speakers doing their job, trackpack is ok, but as i mentioned, it's performance is just not sufficient for this price tag.I really recommend purchasing the Chromebook Pro, hopefully this will perform much better.
Don't buy this product. Only days after receiving I started having issues with the touchscreen. At this moment I need to have it shut off at all times, or it'll cause the screen to flicker or close tabs.
Honestly, I was expecting more. It does the job, but lags a lot and the touch screen seems gimmicky more than anything.
Love this notebook computer.
Love it!
This is not the best laptop out there. It is not the best tablet out there. It is, however, exactly what it claims to be. It is a solid Chromebook, with an S Pen. It is easy to use. It is faster than most tablets. It runs Android apps (mostly, but it is still in Beta and it shows). My only complaint and the only reason why it gets four stars instead of five is because the hand writing input is restricted to the Google handwriting input; having used several other devices with S Pen and the Samsung keyboard, the Google input is a letdown. Paired with the INKredible android app, this is a near perfect Chromebook. If keyboard apps ever start working, it will be a 5 star from me.Pros: Inductive stylus, handwriting recognition, Android apps (beta), light, USB C.Cons: Limited to Google keyboard / handwriting for input. There are much better keyboards for handwriting on Android, including he Samsung Keyboard used on other Samsung devices.
It's amazing
Chromebooks have always been a strange beast. Positioned as a budget pc and specialized for people who solely use the internet for most things. The attractive price and portability have been tempting for students, (should I mention budget again?). The problem was the pretty terrible selection of apps in the chrome store, low amounts of ram and generally anemic performance. Generally I've been the type of person to buy full powered 17" gaming laptops (for their performance and ability to reasonably have two documents up at once) and avoid tiny screens and simplified products (i.e chromebooks and smaller laptops). I say this typing on a 14" Asus laptop that is no way comparable to anything worthy of the word gaming.So intro out of the way here's my situation and hopefully this gives some insight. I am very familiar with Samsungs Note line of products. I have a Note 3, Note 4 and Note 10.1 (2014 edition). I DAILY use the stylus function on the 10.1 for school. I hate paper, and cant keep it organized either. So that Note 10.1" was my everything for about two full semesters, even with its weird 16:9 display not matching the format for a standard 8.5X11" piece of paper. Lately it's been performing strangely, is well outdated (thanks samsung) and unless you're familiar with modifying the OS, its pretty much time to move along. (constant crashing during class causing loss of notes and corruption of others is completely unacceptable).So I started looking for alternatives, The TAB A with S-Pen or Tab S2 are pretty insanely priced, though those OLED displays are face meltingly beautiful. So what were my options? Buy the 12.1 2014 edition? Thats not gonna help. Luckily this was a brand new option that was available.Being skeptical, a 15 day return policy from a certain Blue Box retailer with its notable lack of creepy smiley face logos everywhere and no mart in its name made it easy enough to take it for a test drive.Okay, cut the crap right? Got it.This Laptop/2in1/chromebook whatever you want to call it is very impressive, as long as you understand the limitations. The display is beautiful with its high resolution display, near infinite viewing angles, excellent colors and VERY punchy brightness thats great for outdoors. I regularly find myself staying at 50% brightness for comfortable indoor use in bright areas, or lower at night.Battery life is incredible. for something so small with a bright screen, the battery life easily lasts all day, writing notes, browsing the internet etc. Games and video do put the hurt on it though.Construction:Fantastic, no real noticable flex, screen with my palm on it on tablet mode offers little if any noticable flex. Its REALLY thin, and light. and from a distance looks like a product from a certian cultish fruit themed computer company, except I didnt have to sell my internal organs to afford something with annoyingly crippled hardware. Its sports two USB Type C ports, a headphone jack (so unbrave of them to include this right?) and a microsd card slot for more storage.It runs on USB Type C!I thought it was strange at first since I hate having to carry another adapter to connect/charge devices (friggen dongles man). But its not so bad since if youre in a stretch, you can use a powerbank or even your phone charger if your batteries low and you need life support. IT will barely keep it alive, but thats better than it being dead. This is very welcome during long study sessions before calculus tests at your local 24h diner.Now usability wise?This is chrome OS, so were screwed right? Not really, googles been working on giving you access to the android store, which is what sold me on this device really. You go from terrible apps, to the play stores excellent selection, that most apps work on. My note taking app of choice is Inkredible, which is available on Android or iOS and LEAUGES better than SNote or anything ive seen from the iOS store. Plus the Dev is a pretty cool person and helped me upgrade from regular to pro when pro was released, (i bought every feature for the regular app and well exceeded the price for pro which had almost the same features).This combined with the S-pen is pen, makes this a killer note taking device since it gets palm rejection from the app, and the excellent wacom backed writing supplied by the pen, IT works with any Note 3/4 compatible stylus which is pretty awesome.Android apps work almost flawlessly, some strange hiccups are present, since the store is still in beta, but games work mostly well, my Inkredible works great and often most of the google android based apps work better than anything chrome can supply.The strangest thing is that Android is run in a sandboxed evironment.What does this mean? Well Chrome OS is designed to be very secure, which is great for the less savvy users, but this locked down environment doesn't play well with androids setup, so Google has Android "fenced in" in its own little world, where it cant affect/harm the main pc. It gives access to features it needs in a "grapevine" sort of fashion. This means that there are certain strange things that happen, Your android apps cannot see the full storage option on your device, only the downloads folder. Printing in android apps does not work well with network shared printers, wifi printers maybe but I dont have one so I cant test that. This makes transferring files strange, but doable. Grab a file manager, use the google file manager to download your game saves/documents/data files from your favorite apps, dump em in the downloads folder via the chrome files app, then use an android file manager to move them around as needed or transplant them into the file folder present in the root of your android install.Games can get a little laggy as this processor isnt the greatest, but most run just fine. My biggest complaint is there does seem to be a little bit of an afterimage or ghosting present on the display for faster moving games, but who cares for this price.Well in any case, I think I've said enough, Its not perfect, but it's damn near close. I'm a month in, and I have no regerets, especially since I got one from the amazon warehouse in virtually new condition for well under the full asking price due to the recent crazy sales. It also helps that google gives you a $20 credit for the play store.Have fun and try it out, you may just find it replaces your light computing and tablet needs.
This is a lovely object, well made and functions well. However some android apps install but function badly, notably Facebook and Facebook Messenger
I was disappointed by the quality of the product almost immediately. While I did expect the minor physical defects described and found them to be more minor than anticipated, I did not expect an issue that would impact the use of the product.My particular Chromebook had an issue that caused the cursor to move, disappear, or completely freeze after the screen was adjusted. I suspect a pinched cable in the hinge is the issue.That being said, I enjoyed what little productivity I did get out of the Chromebook; I will return the warehouse "deal" for a brand new one and give Samsung the benefit of the doubt.
This Chromebook is great!
My new Chromebook give me life!! You might want to get you one
love it
Note: I bought this at Best Buy for the same sale price. Now that I have to pay sales tax in Florida on Amazon purchases, the 7% incentive to buy online is gone. Same price - immediate gratification, easier return. Best Buy it was.I have been following 2-in-1 laptops for the last 6 months without being able to make a decision. I looked at high end Windows (HP Spectre, the Acer models, the Lenovo models, the Dell models, etc). Based on review, I discarded the low end models. I have had a Chromebook FLIP about a year and it is okay, but too small. I read the reviews on the Samsung Chromebook Plus and Pro and decided to wait for the Pro. I finally gave up waiting because there was still no release date and there was a sale on of the Plus.I am completely satisfied with this computer. I stream easily with a clear image (great graphics) with only a very occasional flutter in the motion. I can multitask without it bogging down. Also, I found the magic command to show all of the Chromebook secret commands: control-alt-/ (or ? if that is easier to remember). Yes, there is a delete letter key, as well as delete word, screen shots, partial screen shots, and a hundred other commands that make the Chromebook more functional than Windows, rather that less. And you can activate the F top row keys with a keyboard settings switch. I have had no problems switching into and out of tablet mode. And the Android apps have been for the most part running flawlessly.This is more functional that a Ipad and much more value for the money that a WIndows computer or a Macbook. For example, I am learning Spanish and I can use a Chrome extension to translate words by hovering over them or tapping, even in the tablet mode. More enjoyable, I can use Lyrics Here and Transover to translate the lyrics of Spanish songs while listening to them on Spotify. I now can enjoy listening to Cafe Tecvba and La Oreja de van Gogh.Microsoft is coming out with their version of a Chromebook with a Windows browser. But it will never had the extension base and the Android App base that the Chromebook does (I am sure it will not run Chrome). I don't know if the Samsung Chrmoebook Pro is better than this, but for the price I got this there is nothing better at twice the price than this Plus.
Display bright and sharp, s-pen high sensitive and slim body, very good.
My chromebook used to have limitations so I would need to use my husband's PC every once and a while. Now I add a few apps and its more functional and less expensive. This on in particular is great, the touch screen is great. When you use the stylus it doesn't respond to fingers, so you can rest your hand on the screen.
amazing design, but very laggy and slow. Honestly. Unfortunately, not for me, and had to return it. Problems in deleting files. Was on the phone with the samsung support and google too. this is great small toy for students , but if you're looking for something a bit more powerful, then no!it lags even with just 2 windows opened. Great screen, but... I am gonna go for something else. I wish I could already buy the PRO ! but samsung for some reason is not releasing that yet.
Piece of junk, got it from Best Buy yesterday and screen has been scrolling automatically and random buttons are being clicked without touching the laptop. There seems to be an issue in the areas where you would test your palms. the laoptop goes crazy. Returning it to Best Buy tomorrow. I will try to add video some place.
Fantastic, the best computer until now.
I was looking for a laptop that would be easy to use for digital art and inexpensive. However, I clearly was unaware of how awful the Google Drive service is. I lost lots of work on Google Docs not a week after purchasing this laptop, even though the internet connection was strong. It takes forever to transfer and move files around. The drawing program is called ArtCanvas, it's okay but still inconvenient- no way to add text, etc.Additionally, these Chromebooks are supposed to be virus-proof. I was doing clothes shopping and have gotten a pop-up every time I use my laptop, despite adding the website to my block list and never actually ordering anything from the site.Frankly, this laptop is a waste of money and energy. It's alright just for watching videos, but as other people have mentioned the sound quality is terrible. I can't recommend this computer. I had an HP laptop for the past 5 years which was much better. This system is poorly designed and slower than it should be.During the time it took for me to write this review, I was waiting for a file in google drive to transfer to another folder. And.. it still didn't. If I wasn't making digital art I would not have kept this laptop.

I really,really wanted to like this Chromebook. I did a lot of research, reading about the good and bad, but I made the plunge. It is an attractive device and I like the build quality. My issues with the device far outweigh its looks. When switching to tablet mode, which I realize will be far different than say an iPad, the device lags. I installed the Netflix app from the Playstore and when scrolling the screen jumps back and forth. Two other apps I installed (Facebook and Yahoo mail) failed to work at all. Finally, the wifi range of this device is the worst of any that I have ever tried in my house.I feel like I bought a device that was still in beta testing, not ready for Prime time. I've returned it and will wait to see what the market brings next. I simply can't recommend this device.
Not good for completing work; screen jumps around, icons pop up on the screen, background changed on its own. Thought I could use it for work. I love samsung but this device was HORRIBLE. In order to print through google cloud, you already have to have the printers stored on another computer. Not happy at all with the product. I ended up purchasing a Samsung Notebook 9 Pro and that is exact what I needed.
Had this for a couple of weeks and the jury is still out. It has some cool features but there are some things I miss about my Toshiba Chromebook.Pros:- Form factor - it's extremely thin- USB-C - has a USB C on each side for charging/connectivity. The nice thing is you can plug the charger in whichever side is convenient. Of - course no turning the connector over to figure out how it goes in - it's about time!- Android apps - this is the first Chromebook built from the bottom up to run Android apps. Now I can play Words with Friends and run most of my other apps as well.- Converts to tablet - this plus the fact that it runs Android apps makes it very convenient- Stylus - it's cool although I don't use it very often yet.- Bright screen with 4x3 ratio - the 4x3 ratio is actually more useful than the widescreen notebooks. Makes for more usable space.Cons:- No backlit keyboard - really? For a $400 Chromebook one would think this would be a given.- The keyboard - I can't put my finger on it but these keys are hard to get used to. Backspace key is too small and hard to hit (I make a lot of mistakes)- Trackpad - not very responsive. The tap to click doesn't work very well, not near as good as the Toshiba I traded in for this. This is one of the biggest cons to me because I use the trackpad all the time.- Android apps are buggy - Android support on Chromebooks is still in Beta status and it shows. Apps crash or don't display very well. It's the price you pay for being on the bleeding edge.- Speakers in the bottom - not sure what Samsung was thinking. Probably the worst place to put speakers. Volume is just barley adequate and completely inadequate in a loud room.Those are the high points. Overall it's a pretty good Chromebook it wouldn't hurt to have a little more horsepower which the Chromebook Pro should provide.
It stopped working shortly after arrival - but after the return window from Amazon. Returned it under warranty to Samsung about a month ago and they still have not fixed, replaced or returned the chromebook! They have give me the run around, lied about getting back to me with information - yes, LIED about it. Samsung electronics USA has the worst customer service imaginable and their new chrombook - a damned expensive one is a hunk of garbage.
Love the chromebook but get really annoyed that music apps like amazon and Google play won't let you upload music unless it's from a PC. So I find myself still using a PC for that purpose. If I knew that I probably would have went with a PC. That is the only negative.
Could possibly be returning it. I'm sure the product itself is great but it arrived in an extremely damaged and oversized box so the device had clearly been slamming around in there the whole way to my house and I think that directly relates to the fact that at least 5 times per day since I got it(which was less than 7 days ago) it has frozen to the point where not even the power button works and I have to do a hard reboot to get it to work again. Really annoying when I'm in the middle of note taking on it at school. I really don't want to return it but I feel like I have to... I may give it a few more days but I should of said something to amazon as soon as I got it. I ordered it just in time for school though and I don't wanna be stuck without it now that all my class docs are on it...
it starts and it works. Perfect tool to surf and even work on basics tasks. The battery is pretty good.Great product, for those who don't need anymore a macbook, this is for you.
I so wanted to keep this beauty. Had to return it because I could find no way to copy and paste. Unless this is fixed it is a fatal flaw.
I don't even know where to begin with this half baked product, In my opinion Samsung should have never released this product in its condition,I'm a diehard Samsung fan boi and this item thoroughly disappointed me, I should just be glad it didn't explode on me, the idea was great but the execution was a flop, Google never delivered on the software and Samsung failed on the hardware, as soon as I started using it I noticed the software and hardware issues, the screen was flickering randomly and the build quality was questionable, clearly not Galaxy grade material.
This is not a good product. I have only had it a few months. Month one it had a battery problem. They fixed it, but sent it back scratched. Now I cannot use it at all as it crashes, deletes things and acts up. Going to try to get my money back.
I wanted to like this unit, but the experience was a negative one for me. As usual there is blame on both sides, but there were some issue that I had not been expecting, especially on the interface side of the equation. The unit itself is light and the design was really excellent. It certainly showed well. I did like the flexibility that the S-pen delivered. The screen was a little odd due to the 4x3 orientation, but I did expect that from what I read about it prior to purchasing it. It still was a bit off putting from my perspective. The operation of the unit was slower than what I expected, especially when accessing the Internet or downloading apps or files. However some real show stoppers for me were its size and the Chrome interface.I was not ready for the size of the unit and the cumbersome process for converting the unit from a PC-like device to a tablet. As a PC device it was fine, but the process of folding the unit backwards on itself was slow and cumbersome. I kept thinking that I was going to drop it on the floor during this operation. I also had some concerns of the longevity of the hinges on the unit. How long would it be before one of them broke or malfunctioned from the PC to tablet conversion? Lastly, when I had the unit in tablet configuration, it was difficult to gripping the unit. The keys on the keyboard did not help me stabilize the unit.My second big issue was the Chrome interface. Yikes, it is bad. It certainly does not seem like a step forward to me. Each time I wanted to access an app I had to go back out to the main screen, open the main app menu, then find the menu I wanted. It is a huge extra step in my opinion, especially when I was "upgrading" from a tablet. Many processes that I use to navigate on a tablet are lacking on this interface.
Android apps regularly crash or freeze the system. Even Google's apps do this. We need a bug fix now or a refund check
screen keeps turning black cant return it because of personal info loaded in it totally usless cant get help .. no one speaks english.. worst purchase ever.. found out this has been an ongoing problem felt I was decieved.. and wasted over 300 dollars.. dont purchase this from amazon..
This is an amazing little laptop. My world swirls around Chrome and Google services (Gmail, Google Calendar etc..)and this laptop bundles all that on the go. It has a solid keyboard and vibrant screen. It's a keeper. It's bona fide.
Samsung Chromebook Plus ReviewThe Galaxy Tab S2 was a decent tablet, but it felt like a downgrade from the Galaxy Tab Pro due to its lower resolution and harder to access components. It basically felt like a fatter, slightly worse version of the same tablet. After being disappointed by a little more of the same happening with the Galaxy Tab S3 coming out and hearing that Chromebooks will now incorporate Android app compatibility, I decided to take a chance and get a Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus. After using the Chromebook Plus for a fairly decent amount of time, I find it difficult to determine why anyone would want to get a Galaxy Tab S3 compared to this. This does everything that the Galaxy Tab S3 does and more, but also better. This has a better I/O dual USB Type C as opposed to 1, plus more versatile in how you use it due to it being a full-fledged computer. Both come with a stylus built in with palm rejection which is nice, and both have very high resolution displays (although the chromebook has a slightly higher resolution, this is not that much of an issue for me as both tablets can churn out 1440p video). The chromebook has a keyboard built in where you donât get that with the Galaxy Tab S3.One of the key benefits of Chromebooks compared to tablets is their full compatibility with Chrome as a browser. This is important because everything you can do on your computer with Google Chrome on a standard PC you can do on a Chromebook, where with the Galaxy Tab S3 you are stuck down with a watered down mobile version. This means that you can add extensions, use Adobe Flash without doing weird things to your Android Tablet, dual boot Linux, and more. Both can run Android apps well, although you may need to do more tinkering with the chromebook if you want to download apps outside the Play Store compared to a standard tablet. Once you do that though, you can also dual boot to things like Linux or even Windows if you so choose where the Galaxy Tab S3 is stuck with Android under most circumstances.Overall, there is really no reason to get a Galaxy Tab S3 when you could get the Chromebook Plus. Itâs cheaper, about as portable, and it is way more versatile than the Galaxy Tab S3. The only thing that the Galaxy Tab S3 that the Chromebook Plus does not have is the rear camera, so if you think the convenience of an average tablet camera is worth sacrificing the crapton of versatility and the cost savings of this laptop, you could go with the S3. However, for most tablet users the Chromebook Plus is a better, more cost-effective device overall.
The device looks great and has a beautiful screen, s-pen, a good keyboard and an OK touch pad. The ChromeOS part if fine but the beta mashup of Chrome and Android is buggy at best. Over time the shiny exterior became scratched and the bottom became just loose enough to no longer feel premium. There is also a flaw that causes the speakers to crackle under load. If you intend to watch a full screen video, make sure you close everything else first. On three occasions while watching full screen videos I had the sound, its very loud and makes you think its about to explode. I really wanted to keep the device but the shiny exterior became easily scratched, the android apps crashed often and the speaker crackle all added up to a fail for me. I returned the Chromebook and paid and almost $90 stocking fee just to get rid of it. My advice would be to wait for the Pro version, let them get the bugs out for a few months or look elsewhere.
Overall great chromebook and tablet. Gorgeous 4:3 screen, only second to the Google chomebook pixe. Slow processor and does not work with crouton due to the currently unsupported processor (a deal breaker for me). No backlit keyboard. Can run Android apps, which I dont really care much about. Really liked it, but too slow for me, returned it to wait for the Chromebook Pro's arrival.
I'm really disappointed there are no USB ports! I guess I just assumed there would be at least one on there.
The only reason I do not give it five stars its because it scratches too easy. Solved the problem with stikes and to prevent more scratches get a case for it right way. I use the case as padding for it while it's in use.
I bought this from amazon and I like it. However, I am not happy it is not getting the latest Chrome update right away. The pen is fine but it has significant lag when writing in OneNote. The lack of backlit keyboard is also a downer. I will be keeping it but I wish that for the $450 I paid for it, it was a little more polished.
Dear Chromebook Plus, where have you been all my life...That basically sums it up, if you want more meat and potatoes read along! First I always qualify my reviews with some background info. Im a portable computing nut. My current (and recently retired) list includes Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4, Dell Venue 11, Chuwi Hi12, Chuwi Hi 8, Chuwi Hi10 Plus, Samsung S2, HP Spectra 13" 2in1, HP Spectre X2, Pavillion X2, etc. I've ping ponged all over the place trying to find the one to rule them all and Im coming to the conclusion it does not exist. My most recently retired machine was the Spectre X2 and the Chuwi Hi12, the Hi12 went to my daughter who basically uses it as a giant android tablet for netflix and simple games, The X2 went on ebay. The main issue with the X2 was weight, battery life, and charging system. When I do heavy lifting I always go for the Spectre laptop but I wanted something for when the laptop felt like overkill and the samsung S2 just wasn't up to the task. The X2 had mediocre battery life and only charged with the proprietary charger and also had a tendence to drain itself even while asleep if not plugged in at all times. More often then not this meant it got used less because I would forget to plug it in and it would be dead a day or two later, or I got tired of having to unplug it.I was never a Chromebook person, they seemeed too limited (yes I get thats the idea) but when I read about android being brought into the Chrome eco system it piqued my interest. The Flip was the first device of interest but the processor and screen were not what I wanted (I'm a lover of squarer aspect ratios). The Samsung piqued my interest again. Was it truly a tablet / hybrid device that was lightweight and portable enough for media consumption but also up to the task of occasional productivity work (excel, email, word documents)? Was it going to be powerful enough to be just enough when I don't want to get out my comparatively heavy and bulky laptop? Was it going to offer the all day battery life and ability to sleep without killing the battery nightly?I figured as a best buy elite member I have 45 days to find out! After about a week with the device though I can pretty much say its not going back. The screen is somehow one of the best I've used bar none, no need to qualify of "at this price point", this screen is exceptional. Bright, great uniformity, no bleed, and so so sharp. While it might seem a bit small by the measurement don't let that throw you off, the aspect ratio gives a much taller screen then you would have in a similar 16x9 laptop and it makes a massive improvement for my real world usage (reading PDFs, spreadsheets, etc.). Some people have complained about performance and I guess it's relative. So far I have found it to be completely acceptable given the price point, the battery life, and thermal envelope. Just tonight as I write this I have outlook (the android app) running, with spotify playing music in the background, a PDF open in Xodo (the android app not the chrome extension), chrome itself with 5 or 6 tabs open including gmail and facebook and the machine is still keeping up with my typing of this review. So for me that would be pretty typical use and its handled it swimmingly. The word processor app does respond a little slower with the android stuff in the background but everything still hums along at a decent pace.I also love that the machine is not just silent, it also runs cool. I've now had 4 Core M devices of various speeds and in tablets of various sizes, even when they run silent they can get uncomfortably warm (looking at you Surface Pro, Dell Venue, and X2). AGain its not the end of the world but its not ideal and once those chips start thermal throttling its debateable if you are actually getting your moneys worth from those chips. The chromebook here on other hand stays within room temperature with no signs of heat build up. Yes Core M is going to be faster but Chrome OS is also very very lightweight and google seems to be more focused on the Arm platform as the lead for Chrome OS. I could be completely wrong once they finally ship it but I suspect the Pro model with Core M is going to have a lower run time, run hotter, and for most people be negligible in actual end user experience.The joys of an always there stylus.. I have styluses for my Hi12, my X2, and my Surface Pros (or did while I had them still). In just about every previous instance they never got used. Its too easy to leave them behind or forget to toss them in your messenger bag, just by simply being there all the time I am literally 10000000x more likely to use the stylus for PDF markup and note annotations. I can go from typing a report on the keyboard to scribbling and highlighting with the stylus in less then 10 seconds. Yes the active stylus on those other devices are technically better but the point is moot when you have to remember to pack them up and find a place to put them. Its the Camera phone vs SLR argument, yes, the SLR always takes the better photos, but the best camera is the camera you always have with you. The best stylus is the one you can effortless have with you and thats what Samsung has delivered here. It is pressure sensitive, theres a modest amount of lag but it will only feel OFF if you are used to a higher end implementation like on the Surface. The physical "feel" of it is actually pretty good, theres a "roughness" to it that makes your strokes and writing feel more grounded. I do miss hover over like you get with the active stylus but again, if this is the compromise to have an always there stylus that doesn't have batteries for anyone but the most art focused buyer I think its the better compromise.Andoid Apps - I've yet to have any that didn't work. A few light mobile games (for testing I swear), e-mail and pdf apps, spotify, the key apps I use all just work. I've also read (but havent really examined it myself) that some developers such as Adobe are now actually designing their android apps with the expectation they will be running them on Chromebooks as well. Either way, Chrome OS is powerful for web work and adding the android apps really lets you fill in some blank spaces.Arm Performance - Anyone can push these chips to the breaking point but I don't think those demands will be typical of your average daily user. As I mentioned earlier, Core M is not power without comrpomise, at least all the devices I have tried it in. I would love for Samsung to prove me wrong but with ChromeOS the OP1 Chip seems to fall into the just good enough category. 4k Youtube, no problem. 60fps Youtube? occasionally a dropped frame but this probably come more down to the software then what the chip is capable of and I wouldnt be surprised if they tightened up support for higher frame rate video sooner then later.As a tablet - Possibly the best android tablet made yet. When folded into tablet mode the screen bezel (the bottom one) is actually a good size to give you a place to hold a nice grip without placing your hand on the screen. If you were to try and hold it by the other side (the top) the bezel is much thinner giving you less surface are to grip if attempting one handed usage. The keys will go clicky clackety when folded up but the machine is smart enough to ignore the keyboard when in tablet model so its inconsequential. All the android apps Ive used have worked well enough and its just the best thing ever to get a full blown Chrome OS browser in a tablet form factor.Build Quality - I think its gorgeous, I don't know why some folks think it looks cheap. The hinge is nice and tight, stays in place and everything just feels solid. The build quality is right up there with my Hp Spectre laptop just in a smaller footprint and at a significantly lower weight. If anything the light weight aspect of the laptop might give it a "cheap feel" but thats just our brains associating light weight with being cheap/empty/plastic. Keyboard is okay, no backlight (oh well) and the plastic keys are a bit cheap feeling especially as compared to the rest of the machine build. Two usb ports (type c) which can be charged on either round out the build. I also love that while they recommend the 30 watt charger it will essentialy take power from almost any source over those type C ports, if you go low enough it will still charge while sleeping but warn you that theres not enough current coming in to use and charge at the same time. The HP X2 was such a pain in this regard, despite charging over USB Type C they lock it down with DRM to only allow charging over THEIR charger. Not only are they over priced, it just means having to pack up ONE more additional adapter and one more thing to keep track of. With the chromebook, it might go slow as dirt, but I Can literally charge it with the most basic phone charger if thats all I've got with me and that does happen on occasion.Ive been using the machine more then I expected and for far heavier duties then I expected. It wont ever retire my Windows laptop entirely, some really heavy spreadsheets (VBA, lots of forumulas) and other system admin and SQL work just aren't suited for the Chromebook but I find myself using the Chromebook primarily and the laptop for those fringe uses in a ratio I honestly did not expect. Highly recomended and if you are concerned about keeping it try to ind one locally at a store such as Best Buy where you would have the option to do an exchange easily enough.
Paint on top wears off easily,otherwise great chromebook! Dunno why people still buy windows computers.
Works well as a chromebook.Pen:The pen seems forced and is more for novelty than true samsung pen usage. It's only good for drawing on the drawing app. The google handwriting recognition is a bit odd to use but works well.Google apps:I use this primarily as a chromebook but with a 12.5 inch screen, it's great for reading marvel unlimited comics after you download the marvel unlimited app from the app store. I've found that most android apps have better web versions so I've only ended up using marvel unlimited and teamviewer as the apps I use primarily with this. Other apps like google music would be great to use as apps since you can control it from the notification area instead of having to switch to the tab.Media:It plays netflix (website) and plex (website) videos very well. I haven't really tried the apps for both of them on this device. I was able to use this device with a usb-c to hdmi connector and watched a couple of shows on an external monitor. It was clear and had no stuttering problems that I typically get from my asus rockchip chromebook. I was on a couple of social media websites, an image site and a chat site while this was going on so that I could watch while I did other things too.What I don't like.So far, being nitpicky, the pen doesn't do anything. I haven't been able to try and install the galaxy note apps on it so that i can try that and the google play store on chrome OS does not support some games.
Great product...
PRO: Works well. Great screen. Light weight. Google will likely support for at least 5 years (search for Google End-of-Live policy). Touch screen is nice for easily sizing text.CON: Poor touch pad. No HDMI output (but can buy an adapter), Backlit keyboard would be nice. Keyboard is a bit small for me. Gets uncomfortably hot on my lap (my two other Chromebooks run cooler). Only has USB-C connections, which are not compatible with other USB connected devices (but adapters are available).CONCLUSION: Less expensive Chromebooks would have better fit my needs, however, it is a nice machine and might well be worth the extra price for other users. Carefully review your requirements.
a great product! To me, it can replace laptops
Sent it back. Not sure why it's asking me twice for the same item. Too hard to work on
I bought this product and the trackpad did not work upon arrival. When I contacted Samsung product support they told me I needed to mail them the Chromebook. I bought this computer to travel next week. Now I will travel with nothing,a nd will have wasted $400. BAD.
I loved this thing for the first 2 weeks. Then the touchscreen just died out on it. I wiped it clean, started over, everything i could find and it no longer would recognize touch. :( Sent back and switching to a different product.
Returning the refurbished one I got from Warehouse Deals. System keeps on crashing. Tried, without success, the following: update to latest version of chrome os; powerwash; switched to beta channel; powerwash again; logged in as guest; switched back to stable channel; powerwash. Tried to create a recovery media; recovery app crashed while creating the USB recovery media. Managed to create a recovery media via Linux, entered recovery mode, and what else? Unknown error in recovery mode.Just gave up. Very disappointed with the experience. If the problem is due to the device being a refurbished one, I am wondering how Amazon checks its returned items.
Still learning all features and use it almost daily
Perfect 2 in 1
I have owned both a surface pro 3 and asus transformer t300 chi so I have dealt with alot of these 2 in 1 stylus devices before. The Surface pro models are probably the best 2 in 1 computer money can buy. The problem with them, however, is that they cost ALOT of money. When mine broke, i could not justify spending another thousand dollars on a portable computer. I bought an asus transformer chi which offered many of the same features for much cheaper, however the device experience was awful. A sub $500 2 in 1 windows computer is slow, has poor battery life and its 16:9 12" screen is far too cramped for any real work.That is when I discovered this chromebook. ONLY CHROMEBOOKS can offer a 2 in 1 device with a stylus, 10 hour battery, super high res screen, and premium build quality at this price point. The internals can be cheaper because the OS is so lightweight that expensive processors arent needed to make it run smoothly.HARDWARE: This chromebook delivers on all of those features. The hardware is excellent. It is very thin and very light and you could easily compare this build to the thousand dollar devices such as the Surface and HP Spectre x360. The screen is beautiful. The 3:2 aspect ratio is very convenient and should be a must for any device that converts into a tablet.SCREEN: There is a reason why the Surface devices have a 3:2 screen. The problem with 16:9 convertibles is that they are awkward when in tablet mode. They feel much heavier due to bad weight distribution in that shape, and the screen is terrible for anything in portrait mode because everything is too narrow. 3:2 makes the screen feel much larger than it actually is, and makes it easy to just flip into portrait to read an article with the same dimensions as a real sheet of paper.SOFTWARE: Initially I was hesitant to switch to chrome os due to the familiarity and dependency of Windows software. Get this device if the only thing you are worried about is Microsoft Office. That is the first thing people fear loosing by switching. Not only are there online versions of this software that work perfectly, but google docs is a great alternative that does just about everything most do in Word. (there is also software for power point and excel).The versatility of a 2 in 1 is shines even further with the included play store access. The apps you can get on this device FAR outnumber any windows machine. If you are going to use a 2 in 1 primarily for applications, definitely get this and not a windows machine. The Play Store destroys the windows store in both quantity and quality. Chrome OS operated very smoothly on this device with little hiccups when surfing multiple tabs or running android games and apps. The play store access really allows chromebooks to be used way more offline (which was a previous issue in earlier versions of the OS) Documents can now be typed, notes can be taken, and games could be played with wifi turned off, just like on my Surface.Dont get this if your work requires some weird proprietary software that has no alternatives, and dont get this to edit videos. Thats it. If these do not apply to your use case, this device will work for you. My work requires coding and programming, which surprisingly there is also online alternatives for (cloud9 lets you run online virtual machines).Get this if most of your work is done online. Get this if you love streaming Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, etc... Get this if you like drawing, taking notes, or annotating pdfs. Chrome os will cover about 90% of what most people use computers for. The Webstore combined with the Play store offer alternatives to almost any software on Windows or Mac that you can think of. I am very surprised that this device was able to even be compared to my beloved surface that costs double the price. This is by far the best 2 in 1 360 hinge form factor device that is less than 500 dollars, and its beautiful.
I, for one, LOVE this computer. I'm not going to pretend that the other reviews had me a little worried but I'm very glad I chose to give it a chance anyways.I bought this one to replace my basic HP Chromebook that I had for 3 years or so. I loved my old one. Just like it, this one performs astoundingly. Long battery life, charges fast, and restarts within seconds to update. I have a windows PC as well and I am really beginning to dread having to use that for anything. The updates are constant and take SO long. . . Although in reality, it's probably not that long, I'm just spoiled by the lightening fast Chromebook updates and startup.I absolutely love the tablet/laptop transition. Everything is extremely smooth and responsive. The incorporated pen is amazing and performs remarkably well. I was pleasantly surprised with the response time of the pen. The pressure sensor is pretty awesome.The remarks about the light up keyboard was an initial turnoff for me as I had a Mac book previously and I thought the lit keyboard was a must have. With my basic Chromebook, I was frustrated with the lack of the lit keyboard but my keys were also white with gray letters. . So the light from the screen was terrible for illuminating them. Since the keys on here are black with white lettering, the light from the screen reduces the need for a back lit keyboard. Even on the low end of the brightness spectrum. So, I like this better. I can still see the keys when I work late at night while my husband is sleeping and it's one less source sucking the battery juice.You can read other reviews regarding the technical specs of this device but it performs wonderfully. I've been very pleased and I'm on this thing most of the day doing school work.The best part, I saved for last. . These wonderful designers are my favorite because there isn't just one charge port, but TWO. . .One on each side so it doesn't matter what side of the outlet you situate yourself. Honestly amazing.Oh, one more thing. . My husband found this new service from Amazon where you can basically log in to one of their computers remotely for a small fee every month and utilize the features of a full blown computer. . We haven't tried it yet, but we went with another Chromebook instead of a standard laptop with the intention of trying that out. . So, you get the price of the Chromebook with potential access to a full blown computer!! Once we try it I will update on it's performance.
TINY speakers with very poor volume - You can barely have a zoom call without headphones. Printing is a nightmare if your printer is not google chrome compatible. You can not save photo files from the web as .jpgs. Since it has no regular USD you need adaptors for every hard drive or external connection. The guy at best buy said "A chrombook is not a computer, it is a glorified web browser" and the longer I used it, the more I found that to be true. I would never ever buy a chromebook again, its just way too limited in what it can do.
Very bad built quality. Track pad died after a few days' use. Touch screen feels like plastic film detached from screen. Basically feels like a budget low quality laptop.
Just received my plus ,very happy with it. Brilliant screen, great trackpad, good keyboard , great S Pen and everything works very smooth. Android Apps are good but I'm sure they will get much better once they lose their Beta label The battery is great too , I only recharge after a full day
Overall it's nice.Would better if it can(1) Support more Android games, like Pokomen Go.(2) support multi view in Tablet mode.
This Computer didn't work properly which I trying to turned it on and didn't come on
I returned it after a couple weeks. The WiFi dropping issue was too annoying. It would randomly lose WiFi connectivity. Restarting the device was the only way to fix it. I looked online and saw so many people complaining about this issue. Even here in the reviews, I saw stories of people going back and forth with customer service about the issue and getting replacement devices. I didn't want to go through all that trouble. It's absurd that, out of the box, it would have such a crippling problem.
Great little Chromebook.
This is my first Chromebook. It is replacing the original Surface Pro.Pros:LightBuild qualityPen works well with good palm rejectionMost the Android apps I use workCons:This can in no way be my only computer. I need things that won't run on this.Small backspace key (not huge deal)So far I am very happy with this as a companion note taker and media machine. At work I run meetings off my laptop and need something to take notes on. Also, I need something to watch media on when travelling. Since I will also have a work laptop with me, something thin and light was ideal.
First time Chromebook owner here. I've read other reviews where people say they wonder if this could possibly replace their main computer, but for me there is no wondering. This machine is absolutely able to do anything I wanted to do with my old laptop or my Surface (both of which I'll be getting rid of now). Rather than run through all the same praises as the other reviews on here (sturdy build, good key response, great battery, etc) I'll just say this was the most painless out-of-box introduction to any machine I've ever used. 5 minutes to sign into my accounts and whatnot, and I was running Spotify, Robinhood, and had multiple tabs open on Chrome, all with no problem. (Though one minor downside that I've read about I can confirm: the speakers are not gonna blow you away. Not bad enough to detract from a 5 -star rating, though.) If you're on the fence, like I was for many months, just go for it.
Google play store didnât work. Couldnât get any apps. Sat on the phone with a lady for over an hour and a half.
Chromebook didn't come with a pencil. I thought it did. Only complaint.
Chromebooks are useless unless theyre connected. Before you buy a Plus, , do a search on "Chrombook Plus Connectivity Issues". You'll get countless hits and You'll also get countless "solutions": If this doesn't work try that... if that doesn't work, try this... well, if that doesn't work... etc. Bottom line, I am stuck with a ridiculously expensive brick. I've had cheap Chrombooks and was very pleased with them , which is why i decided to upgrade. This expensive "upgrade" is a disaster. Don't be fooled by the hype. The glowing reviews are for hypothetical perfect conditons. The countless complaints of "connectivity issues" are testimony to yet another Samsung product that was rushed to market before it's time. I suppose I'm lucky that it simply doesn't work... at least it doesn't explode like their phones. . DO NOT BUY.

The Samsung Chromebook Plus is a phenomenal device. It's light, portable, beautiful craftsmanship, fast, and has a stunning display. For the majority of consumers, this device is all you will ever need for web browsing, media consumption, and now access to the Google Play Store and Android apps. I picked this up at a quarter of the price of my MacBook Pro, But it allows me to do just about everything I need it to do. There only criticism that I have is the non backlit keyboard, lacks HDR, and extended time to awake. This is without a doubt my favorite laptop of all time. I can't say enough positive things about it. I can't imagine why anyone would wait for the Chromebook Pro.
I've been seeing a lot of bad reviews and wanted a chance to give a positive opinion. Coming from a Nexus 9 tablet this has been a great experience. While I've only owned this device for 2 days i'm extremely happy with it. As soon as I powered the device on I had 1 update to do which gave me Android App support right after that. Browsing is great, the keyboard feels nice, the apps work as intended although some apps were designed for phones so you wont be able to full screen. If your looking for a device for basic web browsing, watching shows and doing some word docs this is an awesome device. I don't think it will completely replace a laptop but it comes pretty close at least for me it does. The stylus pen also surprising writes pretty well. Even wit the ARM processor i haven't noticed any lag with the things I've been using this for so overall I think its a great buy. I do agree with most 449 might be a little high in price but considering that high end android tablets go for high 300s, I would recommend this device over those and depending on when you reading this i got mines on sale for $350 so it was definitely worth is.
Coming from a $2000 gaming desktop and a MacBook pro, I didn't know what to expect from a chromebook other than what I have read online. I was looking for a replacement for my MacBook, but I didn't want or need to spend so much money on a laptop that I would mainly be doing web browsing on (I can use my desktop for anything that requires real muscle). All I have to say is that this is definitely 'The Little Laptop That Could'. I usually have pretty high expectations for my devices being in the IT field, but wow has this thing surpassed my expectations. It is quick and snappy and handles most tasks without even breaking a sweat. For web browsing, this is all the laptop you need. I am heavily invested in google services (google drive, gmail, google photos, google play music, etc.) so this works perfectly, but I would say that if you are not a big google user, especially if you don't use google drive or gmail, a chromebook might not be the best laptop for you. What makes this laptop even better though is the ability to use android apps, so for some light photoshop or lightroom work, I can use the android app which works flawlessly. The display on this thing is second to none, and the keyboard, while small, feels just like my macbook. The two biggest gripes that people have (the small keyboard and the lack of keyboard back lighting), are over exaggerated and I have never had a problem with them.Pros:- amazing screen- ChromeOS is a pleasure to work with- keyboard & trackpad are excellent- build quality is better than $1000+ windows/mac laptops- battery life is awesome- integration with google services is seamless- very easy to use for both novices and professionals- touch screen and stylus are a good bonusCons:- OP1 chipset can stutter sometimes, if you'll be doing HEAVY work on Chrome you might want to go with a chromebook with an m3 processor or betterOverall: This is the best money I have spent on a tech product in a long time. If I find continued success with ChromeOS I might permanently migrate to it
My Nexus 9 tablet was getting so old that it felt like it was time to upgrade to a new one, but with Chromebooks now offering Android App support, I thought I'd give this a shot. I liked the fact that it had a keyboard yet was slim and lightweight, but I was concerned about performance. Luckily I think I made the right choice with this.Form Factor / Build Quality- This notebook looks and feels really slick. It's slim, lightweight yet durable. It feels really premium. The display is gorgeous and you can easily run it at 40% brightness and still see everything. The 4:3 ratio while unusual for a laptop these days, but it works great in tablet and tent mode.Performance- I was concerned about the performance since this was using what's basically a phone processor instead of an Intel computer processor. I was pleasantly surprised to see it worked great though. I've used it for about a week now and I've haven't had any stuttering or maxing out on memory. I've had at 20 tabs opens, used Android apps, streams several 1080p YouTube videos and they've always worked fine.Android Apps- So far, it seems like about 90% of the apps I used on my tablet are available on the Chromebook Plus and run pretty well. The Microsoft Office apps aren't available at this point which was a bit of a disappointment. I had one or two games that crashed a few times, but other than that, it's been clear sailing. I assume this will get fixed in the future as developers adjust their apps to work on ChromebooksBattery Life- The battery life is really nice. I would say the 7 - 8 hours they mention is about right. It's double what I was getting on my old tablet or my laptop from 2 years agoFinal Verdict- Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase. It runs well, is light and does everything I need it to. I would recommend it for someone who wants a secondary device (like a tablet or couch computer) for sure. I'm not sure if ChromeOS is ready to be a full on laptop replacement yet, but it's getting very close.
It was okay, but I was not prepared for the difference between the Chrome OS and Windows. Ended up sending it back.
What I love:1. The screen: clear, large, 3:2 ratio2. The pen: accurate, responsive, attachable inside the device itself3. The battery life: 6-7 hours if I'm multitasking--not the worst ever, and at least the battery is consistent4. Android apps: Kindle, Amazon, Drive, Photos, Snapseed, Gmail, Hangouts, Keep, Google Calendar, OneDrive5. Security: password locked on boot-up, smart-lock if my cell phone is close by6. Keyboard: deep travel, large keysWhat I hate:1. No Microsoft Office apps anymore (as of 24 Mar 2017). I had to sideload the apks from my smartphone. They installed and worked great. I think Microsoft is just the punk as usual and revoked their access to Chromebooks.2. My favorite game on android (Rusted Warfare) will not accept touch input after I join an online game.3. The battery life is not 10+ hrs4. Slower charging for a full charge. It takes at least a couple hours for a full charge.5. No multitasking in tablet mode6. No desktop icons7. Swiping gestures in android apps are buggy. Sometimes it recognizes the swipe and sometimes not.8. KineMaster (the best professional video editing app for Android) force quits every time I try to launch it.9. Will not read 1080p 60fps video properly from my SD card from my camera. It opens the video and plays a weird rainbow filtered version of my video. It is by no means useful.Since there are so many negatives... I may be returning this Chromebook.
So far so good. I am happy with the flexibility of my Chromebook Plus.
From opening the box to up and running in five minutes! Boots in no time, and also runs Android apps. I now use my Windows computer only for the very few things that the Chromebook can't do, like burning DVDs. When it comes to email, spreadsheets, docs, editing pictures, editing audio, and almost everything else, the Chromebook wins hands down every time! By the way, you can plug in an external hard drive for reading and writing, and an external optical drive (CD, DVD, etc.) for read-only. So you can play music and movies from discs. Also, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that my machine came with $20 in Google Play Store credit, although I can't guarantee that they'll continue to do that.
First, I purchased this product at a local Big Box retailer, not on Amazon. I don't think that matters, but I will note that.The Chromebook idea is a good one in my opinion. However, it is too limiting to be useful for _my needs_ at this stage in the game. From printing to app support - it is a bit of a wasteland. That said, the ability to run Android apps was one reason I picked this unit up. However, given the state of Android apps on ChromeOS - you are likely not going to bother. Office365 for instance, something that I really wanted to work on this unit - simply does not work. Microsoft won't allow you to download it from the Play Store on the device - probably because the screen size exceeds what Microsoft allows you to run Office for free. But I have an Office 365 account - and I couldn't find a way to get it on there. Anyhow, given how some of the other Android apps run on the device (that is, poorly) - I am not sure I want to bother.The build quality on the unit is questionable at best - under the screen glass there is a ripply looking plastic strip that looks extremely cheap. The hinges are cheap looking and the keyboard is barely acceptable for a device of this price. This is not a $250 Chromebook - it is almost $500 after taxes! For that price, there are lots of decent options out there.The stylus is rather on the flimsy and cheap side as well. It doesn't write particularly well, especially if you are used to a Surface Pen or an Apple Pencil.The OS is not that touchscreen friendly. Sometimes I would be playing a Youtube video in Chrome and it was a pain to use the 'scrub' control - it would sometimes misdetect where I put my finger. These are the same kinds of issues that using Chrome on Windows 10 on a touch device has. So while "tablet" mode sounds appealing at first - soon it became an exercise in frustration.I installed Linux via Crouton which is a very cool exercise by the way. This almost clinched it for me - but due to the ARM processor some software doesn't have native packages and you will have to recompile them yourself. Life is too short to waste on a $500 Chromebook that does less than most mid-range Windows PCs or used Macs. The ARM processor causes some sites to lag a bit compared to Core based Intel processors. I believe the Chromebook Pro has an Core M3 processor but is not out yet.If all you do is browse the web and do light productivity tasks - this machine might work out for you. But I almost wish that Google hadn't released the Android Play Store until it was completely ready. Because it is starting to smell like other Google abandoned projects at this point that will never work quite right.Skip this one unless you are happy having a dedicated Chrome computer. I might come back to revisit this in a year to see where they are. There are many good things about ChromeOS - long battery life, no maintenance, instant wakeup, etc. This unit is a rarity in that it has a 3:2 screen which I prefer for doing productivity work and web browsing (particularly in portrait mode).But this unit paired with ChromeOS is just too expensive and buggy for what you get. If it were $300 I think this would be a five-star product. But given that it is priced to compete with mid-range laptops and iPads, it is difficult to recommend. If you want a Chromebook there are many cheaper options.
Great 2-in-1. I've tried many Chromebooks before but ended up returning them all, due to the limited usability and so so displays. This Chromebook is a breakthrough. It's not perfect yet, and there's room for improvements, but it's a big improvement compare to previous chromebooks.The (+):Display: Nice 12.2" high-resolution 2400x1600 at 3:2 ratio. At this resolution, text looks very crisp, and pictures are not grainy at all, you virtually can't see the pixels. 3:2 ratio also means the screen is more square than rectangular and has a bigger surface area than comparable 12" long and narrow 16:9 screens you see on most netbooks and ultrabooks. Yes, it's actually a bit bigger than most of those screens. This display is quite bright as well, so reading outside should not be a big issue.Touch screen: this has open made this chromebook much more usable, of course in combination with the ability to download and use Android apps (I'll get to that in a bit).Performance: the chromebook is snappy for what I use it for: web surfing, messaging, emailing, and streaming movies. It's not quite as fast as my Macbook Pro, but it's not quite as expensive either. If you need to do some serious office work, with two dozen browser tabs opened, and multi tasking with a bunch of applications, this is not what you want, nor is it designed for that. You can probably do some quick and light work with the Google apps (Google Doc, Google Sheet etc), I haven't tried that yet.Google Play Store: this is what really improves the usability of the chromebook. Before, you are limited to pretty much the Chrome browser, and a couple of Google apps and browser extensions. Now with the availability of Android apps, coupled with the touch screen, you can use the chromebook in many more ways. Not all apps from the Play Store work or work well, but I find the ones I use frequently work fine.Keyboard and touchpad: keyboard works well, reasonably springy and tactile. It's not the Macbook Pro's keyboard (the older one, not the new shallow one), but it's better than keyboards on many budget laptops. Keys don't require a lot of force to press either (less fatigue). Touchpad is responsive and seems to be accurate as well.Build: metal and not plastic, so there's not much creaking as in cheap netbooks.Weight: pretty light. The specs say 2.38 lb. My food scale showed 2.35 lb.The (-):Build: though it's metal, it's not as solid as I'd like. I can tell the different in build quality instantly picking up my old macbook air and this chromebook. It's not as solid as the macbook air. There's still a little flex and creaking, but not to the extend of cheap plastic laptops. The design and build also doesn't scream premium either (which it's not). No one will mistake this for $1000+ laptops.Keyboard: though the layout is mostly normal and fine, the diminutive backspace key is annoying (it's even smaller the the regular letter keys). I also prefer the lettering in CAP as most regular keyboards rather than lower case like this keyboard, though it's just a very minor complain.Web cam: I'd like it to have a little better resolution and works better in low light. So far it's the worst cam among all my devices when I skype.Price: at $420 (I got it cheaper than that buying an open box and with a $50 student coupon from Best Buy), it's relatively expensive for a Chromebook. I think $300 (or cheaper) would be a sweet spot.Summary: If you need a lightweight laptop/netbook just for surfing the web, checking you email, skypeing with your friends, watching your netflix, or occasionally work on your documents and excel spreadsheet, this might be a good alternative to cheap, low end Windows laptops. It's very adequate for that kind of usage, and I plan to get 2 more for my parents.* Updated 4/19/2017 *After using it for about 2 weeks, I've discovered some quirks, and deducting a star.- Not sure why, but Chrome on this laptop doesn't render some sites correctly (for example the WSJ's comment section).- When streaming directly from some website (for example CBS, ABC, or NBC), the video stutters, with jerky motions, unlike on other laptops. Strangely, it's smooth from other sites (Fox, etc). I don't like to use the apps because the apps are still lacking comparing to the website.I'm still keeping the laptop. Hopefully, future Chrome OS updates will bring improvements.
I'll admit, I bought this machine fully expecting to return it, and have been pleasantly surprised. I've got enough computers, but the the stylus and promise of Android apps intrigued me so I decided to buy what seemed to be an over-priced chromebook. But what were once billed and priced as semi-disposable laptops have matured into a real PC-killer for most users. I have previously owned Samsung's 11.6" Chromebook, circa 2013, which was passable as a cheap web browser, but lacked a lot of the quality and functionality present in this latest generation of machines.So far, with 5 days of frequent use, performance has been responsive and snappy. I installed a few of my favorite Android apps, including the ones that inspired the purchase of this computer - Autodesk Sketchbook and Corel Painter Mobile. As a professional artist I can say that both applications perform beautifully on this machine, in part thanks to the screen (which is truly impressive for a laptop at this price point), and of course the included stylus. The concept of mixing web apps and analogous Android apps is pretty confusing, and mostly comes down to preference. Personally I find it's best to use Android versions of apps like Inbox, Calendar, and Twitter while sticking with the more robust web-based versions of Outlook, Docs, and Hangouts.The important take-away here is that many of the gaps in available software that made Chromebooks a dubious purchase in the past have been filled with Android's software library.So who is this computer for? I'd say it's for anyone who is already a user of Android and Chrome who wants to avoid the mess that is Windows. Its construction is solid, and the hardware feels good. The keyboard is much better than you'd expect, as is the track pad. The addition of the touchscreen and stylus make this a very versatile device, and one that has won me over. It won't replace my MacBook Pro (there's no replacing the Adobe Suite), but it will fit on an airplane tray table with room to spare and get me by while commuting on a train or sitting in the coffee shop.
I've been using my Samsung Chromebook daily for six months and I couldn't be happier with it. This laptop is a game changer for me, I can't see myself ever using anything bulkier again. It's so lightweight, extremely portable and feels durable enough that I don't feel like I have to wear kid gloves when I use it. I tote it around campus and it barely makes a difference in my backpack. It's ultra fast, from the time I open the lid to the time I'm using the internet it's probably less than 10 seconds.Seriously, I recommend this laptop to everyone. If I had paid twice as much for it I would still feel like I got a deal. I'm a cheapskate so that's saying a lot.Being a student, I was a little worried that I would run into problems due to being restricted to Google apps but so far, so good. In fact, it's made my life even easier because I've been able to use the touchscreen to sign documents that I otherwise would have had to print, sign and scan.As someone who often suffers "buyer's remorse" after a large purchase, I haven't regretted buying this laptop for a moment! I absolutely feel like I got my money's worth out of it.
I love this machine! The screen is unlike any chromebook to date. Here's a few weaknesses as most everyone has covered the key features :Android integration. This is Chrome OS version 56 (is in beta testing on android). Apps due got to full screen, but the window is small text and not fully proportioned to the screen, best to leave these in native size ( think large phone). Too bad you came have a couple Android windows positioned side by side. A bit of puffiness here : not sure Android is working all that well, I see crashes often and it is still better to use Chrome extensions of you can, like Office 365.Pen input is based on other Samsung products and I think it is an s-pen, really unique. Get the Chrome extension for Google Keep installed and a lovely app on the Android side is "Squid" as it gives a college rule page to write on. At this price point, can't help but love hand writing recognition etc. Drawing is fun too.Battery life is OK. But do know you have a bright screen so 7 hours is the norm. It's love 10-12 hours.Touch pad and screen will work fine. Use both or one in concert with the task.No reason to get the pro, I know there's lots of hype about it. Not needed unless you are doing something like video editing (get real Samsung), as the Plus model has hardly any lag and if you want to pay over $500 it is your money.It really didn't replace a tablet for me, the screen is about space for productivity. It's not a good substitute for an iPad but definitely is a replacement fire the Macbook Air. Chrome is not for media generation, other that light photo editing tasks. Polarr is a good extension for that.Have fun!
If you are looking at Chromebooks, this is the best for a truely well rounded tablet and Chromebook combo. I choose this one over the Pro because the Plus runs Android apps better. I would love a Pixel book but the price is a joke. I would never spend $1000+ dollars on a Chromebook. For a quality laptop running windows, sporting a Blu-ray reader with more functionality I could justify a grand but not for a simple Chromebook for schoolwork and watching Netflix etc.
I love this Chromebook! Except for when I don't. What I have learned is be prepared to powerwash, factory reset, your Chromebook every few months. Then again I am always switching between the unstable, beta and stable channels of Chrome OS, which requires a powerwash each time you change channels. Then you may run into a random issue of an android app misbehaving, which can lead to you powerwashing your system. The only great part about powerwashing your Chromebook is unlike a windows pc it automatically re-installs all add-ons, extensions and android apps (once you give the system permission to use the Google Play Store again).Now onto what I like, the screen...it has great colors, great viewing angles, and it very sensitive to the touch. USB-C! The port to rule all ports, not really that excited but I do like having a usb-c port on both sides and both being able to charge the device.
(ANOTHER UPDATE: Touchscreen has died after approximately a month. Beginning the repair/exchange process. Boo.)(UPDATE to UPDATE: Powerwashing solved the disappearing mic problem. Adding the fourth star back.)(UPDATE: Unfortunately, a very annoying problem has popped up. Long/short, the mic dies when the device is slept/woken. I.e., the mic ONLY works upon initial powerup/restart. Once you sleep the device..., the mic becomes unusable for all apps. The only way to restore mic functionality is to restart the device. Reducing rating to 3 stars..., though I'm kinda "2 stars" upset at the moment.)It seems to me that Chromebooks are a little tricky to review. The software experience belongs entirely to Google..., and the hardware in this case, Samsung. So..., I'll split my comments between the two, pros and cons.Before I get to that..., why I bought a Chromebook: My old tablet was getting VERY long of tooth (a Xoom) AND I was wondering if there could be a laptop replacement that would make more sense from a security perspective, compared with my MBP, e.g., crossing US borders.The Software:The Chromebook "Concept" (aka the goog software): In many ways, particularly with regards to initial setup, this is a very nice device. Goog does a nice job of keeping simple things, simple, and complicated things..., just barely possible. The jury is still out in my mind whether I find this a satisfactory compromise compared to a "real" laptop. Let's just say I'm glad I only paid $400+ for this device rather than $2000+ for laptop that has a Chromebook's software imposed limitations.Functionally, it's not a bad, but it is an imperfect, replacement for a tablet..., and strangely, it's only held back in that regard by the hardware (which I'll get to). The Android support has worked well for the limited cases I've tried (Kindle Reader mostly).I'm glad I got a "convertible" chromebook..,, since I've found the touchscreen to generally work very well..., and seems to be well integrated with MOST (but not all) of the software.I miss support for desktop Chrome's version of "People"..., the account support on the device really doesn't cover it.The soft keyboard (when in "tablet" orientation) works..., OK..., but there are quite a few cases where is doesn't integrate correctly/well with various screens/apps, i.e., it obscures the text region with focus..., so you end up typing in the blind.The way in which "chrome://apps" was removed seems needless..., why not just jump to the "launcher"? This in turn creates sync complexity when managing your chromebook settings and your usual desktop settings (I use chrome://apps as the home page and new tab page on the desktop/laptop).The Hardware:Samsung has made a really nice device. Rising above all over qualities of the device..., is the screen. It's beautiful.Construction quality, for the price, is pretty dang good.Battery life is sorta "meh". It seems to be more on par with a smartphone, than a laptop, given comparable usage. It's not bad..., but it's not great.Speed/performance is..., adequate, but not stellar. Things like Netflix work fine, but things that aren't accelerated by specialized hardware are kinda pokey.I don't generally like devices of this small a form factor, and the Plus is no exception. It would be unfair to single it out on that basis. It will serve its purpose, but I will always prefer using my "big" laptop.There are two hardware limitations that I didn't think about prior to purchase, that prevent the Plus (or probably any Chromebook) from being a true tablet replacement for me: No GPS, and no "sleep" ability from which certain events (e.g., an alarm clock..., or skype) could wake the device.The speakers..., sigh..., they really are weak. Some improvement can be had depending on positioning of the device..., but overall..., they're not great.So..., my purchase decision was based on a compromise between possibly competing goals..., so I shouldn't be too surprised that the result was something of a compromise. Nonetheless, I think Chromebooks are here to stay..., and the Samsung Plus is a nice example.That is all!
I have to say this is the best Chromebook I've ever used. I've been using a Note 10.1 2014 tablet and an Acer cb11 for a while and was hoping the Plus would combine and replace these two devices. It's not quite ready to replace my Tablet but I expect this to change when they switch over to the Nougat version of Android. The tablet mode is still finicky and not stable. The tablet experience will have to improve. But it's still usable and as a Chromebook is perfect.It's plenty fast, great screen, lightweight and built solid. Plus my other s-pens work with the screen (although Samsung says it's not an s-pen).You won't have any regrets buying this Chromebook.
Bought this at Fryâs on a sale, and must say, this thing is amazing.Pros:-Top notch screen that is crystal clear and can get ridiculously bright.-Thin and relatively light, yet sturdy-Google Play store-Stylus and Samsungâs art software-Battery life-32gb storage with MicroSD slotCons:-Finger prints are very noticeable if your brightness is turned down while youâre in a well lit area-Not all Android apps will run natively at the proper resolution, for example Crunchyroll (though it runs just fine in chrome lol). Game wise, Vainglory is amazing Iâm this thing-3:2 aspect ratio is a little weird, but YouTube for example takes advantage of the extra space below and above the video.Coming from a 2013 Chromebook, this was a tremendous upgrade. It will not replace your regular PC or MacBook Pro, but Googles integrated office software and the App Store makes this a competitive piece of hardware.
Unreal, way of the future. If it was more powerful I would use as my primary. USB type C on both sides, keyboard not difficult to adjust to / big enough, screen and battery solid.I can't explain how convenient it is to have this form factor that includes an attached keyboard, stands for viewing movies, and a tablet.The android experience on chromebooks needs a lot of work, but as soon as you download your first app you realize the potential.I've had to think through web app vs android version of the various software I use, double notification etc... but I'm convinence this is the way of the future.
I purchased this item from a local big box because of a promotion they were running. This is my first chromebook and I am pleasantly surprised. For what I intend to use it for: emails, web surfing, and school work it seems to provide enough performance to accomplish those tasks. The aspect ratio of the screen is at first, odd. After using it for awhile, I've grown to appreciate it's size and clarity. The display is bright and sharp and very comfortable to look at. The included stylus resembles the S-pen from Samsung's line of Note devices and is more a novelty for me than a key tool. It does work well, and provides some interesting tools for interacting with the operating system. The ability to manipulate the position of the screen is an amazing feature. Being able to transition from laptop, tent, to tablet forms is a lot more useful than I had originally imagined.Coming for a mid-2012 Macbook Pro, the keyboard is definitely smaller and the trackpad isn't as smooth. However, the savings in weight is enough for me to overlook those minor issues. The inclusion of the app store is definitely a welcome addition, but there are issues that cause apps to crash randomly. As this function is still in beta, I was prepared for this and do not consider it as big an issue as it may seem.My main motivation for purchasing this product, was to avoid having to bring my laptop and additional tablet with me on a deployment. So far, it is working out well and I'm very pleased with this purchase.
I'm a regular Chromebook user and this is my 5th one. Unfortunately, the wifi module in this one will spontaneously turn itself off after 10-30 minutes of use, and the only option is to reboot your machine. In the settings, Wifi is turned on, but no networks will show. Apparently, this is a known bug. How do you release a cloud-based device in which the wifi is buggy??I had heard good things about this device and am really annoyed. Switching to an old Chromebook until this is fixed...
Chromebook has been a pleasure to use (2 weeks) especially the amazing screen quality!The build materials are great, (metal all around) it feels more sturdy than my ipad which seems fragile by comparison.The Chromebook uses Android Apps out of the box, and mostly my experience has been very good. A fee apps (whatsapp for example) says not compatible with this device. I think once all of the glitches are ironed out by Google and a universal app (phone and tablet) version is the norm the Chromebook will easily replace Windows laptops.The Chrome OS although simple, is really really fast! I haven't had any software problems with the Chrome side. At first, I thought the Chromebook wouldn't be too useful but the more I use it, the less I am carrying around my laptop (as others have also stated on Amazon.)Battery life has been very good, and since this is my first tent/convertible device I have to say its a great feature to use. Viewing movies, presentations and Skype are really great in tent mode.One additional area to comment on - the sound quality. Playing music or videos on the Chromebook Plus has awesome sound from the speakers. Im not sure why others are complaining because honestly its one of the devices best features imo.Areas for improvement - Obviously make all Android apps compatible. That must happen and soon.Second is somehow integrate the Chromebook with an Android phone. That would solve the compatibility problem - run the app on the phone just display it on the Chromebook!I think the price is somewhat high, but after using the amazing 4K Amoled TouchScreen for a while - the price will seem reasonable.The entire experience really is modern, light, and surprisingly good. My opinion is try it, the device may not be for everyone but like it or not, its probably the future.
Just bought one month back for 11 year old daughter. This is a piece of crap. We fully charge it many times and it would not turn on. It's just like dead bean. Blue green light keep blinking when charge is plugged. Custmor service is pathetic. I wish I could return it. NOT worth it.
I replaced my HP Chromebook that died after 3+ years. I love chromebooks because of the fast startup time and the easy quick updates. I'm totally into the Google system, using their Google Docs, Spreadsheets, Gmail, etc. That said, The startup on the Samsung is S-L-O-W and scrolling is jerky. Faster than my PC but definitely slower than my older cheaper HP. I've tried it on two different WiFi networks just to make sure it wasn't my modem/network. The keyboard is very cramped and I find the muscles in the back of my hand tiring easily. The slimness of the unit makes finding a comfortable place to rest your arms while typing difficult. Stereo speakers are fine until you place the unit in tablet mode; because of placement on the back, the sound is terrible. The battery drains very quickly presumably because of the screen's high resolution; keep the charger handy! The promise of apps is still just a promise: the first two apps I tried on the unit would not work properly. Good stuff: I love the pen when I remember to use it for scrolling and clicking (I haven't used it to create sketches or art). I even signed an online document with it. Gorgeous screen. A lightweight unit overall and turning it into a tablet is cool (though I hesitate walking around the house with it for fear of dropping it, so I still use my lighter Samsung Galaxy Tab A). The other plus of this unit is that, as of this writing, Google will continue to update it for a whopping 6 years. That's the longest update guarantee I could find on any chromebook I was considering. So the high upfront cost of this unit is actually cheaper than others if you consider it is good for 6 years. Overall though, I really expected better performance, comfort and sound from this unit.
The Chromebook plus is hands down the most satisfying laptop I have ever owned.The screen is gorgeous - high color, high resolution, and perfect for we browsing and text editing. The way the screen folds over and the laptop acts as either laptop, tablet or a monitor-on-a-wedge is impressive; it's never been annoying to switch, so far all my scenarios just work.The keyboard - the single reason why I have passed on multiple alternative laptop purchases in the past year is surprisingly good. It's nothing to write home about, lacks a backlight and has a short delete and tabs key as well as no caps lock key, but it works more than well enough in everyday use. My takeaway is that key travel might be the most important characteristic for me, and it has sufficient key travel to make typing comfortable.Speed is not an issue - this is probably the first ARM laptop to be useable, the RK3399 hexacore really shows it's value.The speakers are surprisingly powerful - we just watched the soccer word cup game on the laptop, and it was lifelike.I have installed linux on the system and can both dual boot or use via crouton without issues.Battery life is phenomenal (effectively all day, 6h to 9h depending on usage), and the laptop can charge through the left as well as the right side USB-C port. Charge time is typically less than 40m.Downsides:(1) A keyboard backlight would have been nice(2) A slightly less glossy screen would have been helpful(3) A sim card slot and cell modem would make this the ultimate ultra-portable.
This Chromebook was to replace a Macbook Air from a few generations back as a development machine (using the Cloud9 IDE) - the setup is speedy and works well for the projects I have going. Furthermore, if I felt I needed more power, I could always install Crouton and run Ubuntu on the device.Overall, I've had a great experience with this machine. Chrome runs fast on this device (of course), and I have had nothing but a great experience with it! Google Play apps can be glitchy, but overall the experience has been fine. The stylus works wonderfully with Squid (formerly Papyrus) as a note-taking tool for classes. For some other apps (Evernote, possibly OneNote) it behaves a little more stiffly and can be a bit unresponsive.I'm concerned about the hinges as I do flip the laptop multiple times a day, but it remains to be seen if such fears are warranted. Thus far, 10/10!
Didn't buy it on Amazon as it was back ordered. I like a lot about it. Chromebooks have come a long way since the silly early days and look a lot more like normal laptops. In fact, with the app store close to working it rivals windows 10 as a personal home PC. Microsoft have totally screwed themselves on this front. What I'm not happy with are:Flex in the body, the metal frame isn't solid and doesnt have a convincing metal feelI get crackling noises while listening to music. This is a common problem that I hope will be fixedStylus lags and still feels not readyStylus is plastic and feels cheap
I've had this just a few days but have been trying to put it through its paces. I struggled between this and the Asus Flip C302A. Ultimately, the 3:2 size and stylus won me over, and a slightly better price. I decided early against the Pro because it's overpriced, still has purported bugs, and honestly I prefer the silver. I also waffled on getting a small Windows 2 in 1, but they are heavier and noisier. I'm VERY pleased so far. There's plenty of power to do what I need.Having loved my Android tablets for 4-5 years now, even if tablets are on the way out, I thought it would be hard have a laptop-esque device, but the convertible form is heaven. Just heaven. And stunning screen (I have it set far less brighter and the battery lasts FOREVER). Things others critique: 1) the trackpad is fine, geeze, no problem with it 2) the keyboard is fine and I figure even if you're used to full size, which this really is close to, you will adjust if you have to write a 20 page report.There is a bit of a learning curve using apps here compared to tablets (everything hasn't always been translated perfectly), but the apps I use the most work fine. I'm a light to moderate user and stick to the basics most times. There's simply A LOT this device can do and will only get better with updates, which should come fast and easy compared to a tablet.The weight is awesome. Was worried since it's twice my tablet, but it's still ultra portable. Quiet. Boots fast. Shuts down fast. Looks fantastic. Feels fantastic. Will be great on the couch, traveling, and for giving presentations.
This chromebook is very fast and a very long lasting battery life. The hardware is perfectly done. Feels very solid, very thin, light and premium. No flexes anywhere. The keyboard is really good too for the thinness of the laptop. It is important that you update your android apps regularly because its still in beta. The only problem i have is some android apps crash but after some updates they work great now. I would get this over ipad pro or macbook 12''.solid built quality, very light and thin.very beautiful retina screen same quality as new macbook pro.speed is very fast but make sure you update your android apps regularlybattery life is awesome around 10 hoursboot time is instantly vs slow boot time of mac os and windowstablet mode is same as any android and ipad tablet but the screen is much nicer on this samsung chromebook.chrome os is very fast, efficient, and simple, much better than mac os and windows
Slow, bad keyboard, not particularly light or convenient. You have all the drawbacks of a tablet and a PC but none of the benefits. The screen is good though. I used it for about a month before I replaced it with an iPad Pro 10.5. Will never go back and that is me who is a heavy Google user.My advise, there are a lot of better options for this kind of money.
I bought mine at best buy, but still feel I need to leave a review here. I LOVE THIS LITTLE MACHINE!!! I use it for school, my major is Nursing. The stylus is handy, Chrome OS is actually pretty easy to navigate and the aluminum hard shell keeps it safe. It's been stepped on and dropped already. I can do all kinds of nifty things with more than one window open. I was originally pretty disappointed that it wouldn't support Microsoft Word, but google Docs has certainly fulfilled my needs. Oh the Battery life is also amazing. I charge it at night... most nights... and it lasts all day while I study away. I don't have to worry if I forgot my charger when I go to school because I know it will last all day.If you need something small and portable, but still awesome this is the Chromebook for you.
One thing you need to understand is that the Android app support is in beta mode. The tablet functionality is still very much in development. That means when you switch over to tablet the experience will not be iPad or Android tablet-like. Some apps may freeze, crash. But others work well. I've used Adobe Acrobat Reader to comment and highlight documents, which I then upload to Adobe's document cloud and view them on my PC. There are no issues. My Kindle app performs well as well. Some of the handwriting apps work beautifully with the pen.The screen is the best laptop screen I've used at any price. The images are clear, crisp and exceptionally bright. The touch screen is very responsive. Battery life is good, the system is lightweight and it seems to travel well.If you are complaining about a lack of backlighting on keyboard, well, that shouldn't have been a surprise.
I have had this for two weeks now. This is my fourth Chromebook and 2nd touch screen. So far, this is my favorite. I loved the size of the Acer C100 touch screen but this is almost as light. The screen is wonderful. Other people are more expert at explaining the details than I am but I like that it is small and light enough to comfortably travel with and has a beautiful screen for watching movies. My husband bought one too and he has no complaints either.
Have had mine about 4 months now and we love it. Perfect for web browsing, email, limited writing, reading e-books.Pros: Thin form, nice brushed metal case, LOVE the dual function as tablet and laptop. Most Android apps work well on it. I like the stylus even though I don't use it that much. Beautiful display. Full-size keyboard. Charges quickly and battery lasts a couple days. Boots up in seconds. I was a bit concerned I'd be bothered by limitations of Chrome OS. Hasn't bothered me a bit. Especially with pretty much full Android functionality, there's not much you can't do. It's fast. I've never noticed any lagging and I'm pretty sensitive to that. I like the sync'ing between the Chromebook and Chrome on my desktop.Cons: The keyboard is pretty cheap feeling. Wouldn't want to write a novel on it. Occasional hiccup where I can't type at all--need to reboot then, which takes all of 20 seconds and that always resolves it. Hinges are a bit sticky/creaky--but better that than loose. The file system takes some getting used to. Android apps can't access the SD card--supposedly that will eventually be fixed.Conclusion: Double-plus good. Don't even consider a Windows 10 laptop unless you have absolutely no choice.
Pros- sharp QLED display, fast start-up, multi-angle usage is handy, Slim body feels nice and tight. Fan-less. Stylus integration.Cons- Sound is mediocre and speakers crackle sometimes(I believe it's audio translation error, fixed after refreshing page), Bluetooth seems oddly short ranged as well as Wifi connections in comparison to my other devices working fine in "not far away" corners of the house. Getting acclimated to ChromeOS is challenging. Not AMOLED, just like TVs ALL Backlight LEDs display bland shadows on dark screened movies/videos (although is still a beautiful display otherwise...)This is perfect for my intended uses. I have a Windows10 on another MSI Laptop that is older but, still more than sufficient for all of my Microsoft needs for business and work programs/apps. I am replacing my Galaxy Tab S 8.4 and HP laptop from 2012.After acclimating to this OS I am enjoying this device a lot more. There is a learning curve depending what you are used to. This is lightning fast as far as powering up to using any app quickly. I do like that. My other devices seem sooo much slower to start up now.
The Samsung Chromebook Plus is almost perfect for me. The only things missing are GPS, backlit keyboard, and a second camera to take pics while in tablet mode. The pen isn't the S-Pen that I am used to from the Note series phones, but it works. I like the keyboard/touchpad layout, similar to a regular laptop, but it is chiclet keys. They have a good typing feel, though. The screen is nice and bright, and wonderfully detailed.The reason I bought the product was because I needed to be able to take notes in class (writing), type up papers and such, and maybe play a few games. Unfortunately, the S-Note app from Samsung Note phones isn't available (um, Samsung? Please?), but there are similar Android and Chrome apps available. Thanks to the active pen, I can write on the screen without my hand making errant marks on the screen.The battery life is excellent, and it can go from 0% to full in about 2 hours. It uses USB-C, and there is a connection on both sides of the device. The plug that comes with it is hard wired, but it will charge with a cord and charger block too.All in all, I love my new chromebook, and I would recommend it.
I had Ã  high expectation unfortunatly I was disapointed by 2 items:1- handwriting : not production read at all2- keybord not very productiveI think it is not suitable for professionals. But in my opinion could be Ã  good product if we need it just to navigate et watch video.
This laptop is great. Great screen, speedy performance (handled any porn video I threw at it) and has a perfectly fine keyboard and track pad (dispite all the reviews that say otherwise). Android apps work perfectly with no glitches. I was able to use this laptop as my main laptop - not sure why other's report that this laptop is only good for web browsing and watching videos....The reason I rated the laptop 3-stars is because I needed to return it. The speakers kept crackling and I would lose wifi constantly no matter what wifi I was connected to. I decided to go with the Pro due to its quicker processor. I would have kept the Plus though if I didn't experience the speaker or Wifi issues.
The little Chromebook that could, is what I call this item. I received one to test whenever I was deciding on what new hardware to deploy into my IT department. We use Gsuite and Chromebooks for our employees and are quite satisfied, however, we needed something extra. We turned to the Chromebook plus to fill our niche and it has surprised us all.This device is great for the person on the go. If you work inside web apps all day then this is your machine. It is light, fast and sleek! The screen is sharp and not too small, the resolution is just right, and tablet mode is great for reading. Day to day work task are easily accomplished(this is subjective depending on your type of work).The google play store is meh depending on what apps you use, some are great but others definitely could use some work, but it is in beta. The battery is somewhat lacking and can drain rather quick, mic and camera are decent but nothing to write home about, and the keyboard isn't the best for large hands.The Samsung Chromebook Plus is a niche product but what it does it does well. It provides amazing features at a great price and foot print. I would recommend to anyone who works inside of web apps all day, uses google gSuite, or is developer that uses AWS.
My daughter was so looking forward to this Chromebook as it has a lot of great features. She really liked the touchscreen, the integrated stylus, and the convertible screen that can turn it into more of a tablet. We did learn that the OS is quite different than what we're used to but we figured it out okay. The downside: in less than two weeks she managed to crack the screen, which is glass. Didn't even take much to do it, either, but since it's the screen, it is not covered under the warranty. Since this is a higher end Chromebook, we looked into repairing it. They manage to make every manner of screen replacement that can be purchased online and installed on your own, except for this one. I called Samsung and it's basically the cost of the unit to get the screen repaired. If that weren't the case, I'd give it another star but making something that is basically disposable if anything happens to the screen is a bummer. So word of caution: get the extra warranty!! If for no other reason than to cover the potential (and likely if this is going to an elementary aged kiddo) screen cracks. As for us, we'll be replacing this with a regular laptop.
Great Chromebook--small, light, runs smoothly, great screen, touch is nice to have, etc. The USB-C charging is a neat perk, especially if you have C chargers around for other things (phone, Nintendo, etc.). If you're a coder, you can do Linux stuff on it via Crouton, or Termux from the Play Store. I switch between this and a desktop, and though the desktop's always going to be faster, this processor doesn't feel painfully slow, which is surprising for an ARM chip.The Android app stuff is great, but don't confuse this for a purpose-built tablet--the flipped-back keyboard thing is awkward and it's big/heavy to hold anyway. Sometimes when you're running too much stuff and it runs out of memory, the whole thing will stall for a minute, annoyingly. Occasionally I wake it from sleep and it just reboots. Some of my earlier complaints about sound and the Android integration have been fixed in updates since I got it.I think the market for this overlaps with the one for stuff like the Surface or iPad Pro, or for tiny laptops in general if you don't need to run software written for Windows or the Mac.
The samsung Chromebook is awesome, however there is a known issue. There is a sound issue with the chromebook. Audio wil pop or crack, which Samsung denied happening on the chromebook. I spoke to two supervisors and all they mentioned is they can send it in for repair. I have had two replacements through Amazon which experienced the same thing. The following steps were taken to try and see what was providing the audio popping/craking noise1. Turned Bluetooth On/Off2. Powerwashed the device3. Changed from Stable channel to beta, and vise versa4. Disabled Google Play Store appsSamsung is not honoring their "Number 1 Customer service." I will definitely not be going with them again.Google Samsung Chromebook Plus Audio Popping/Crackling on chromebook forum
I bought this for myself as a graduation present as a replacement for my Macbook, which still works BUT has slowed down considerably over the years. My first impressions were great; the thing is light, quick, aesthetically pleasing. I feel like I am just now really figuring out all the cool stuff it can do. My favorite apps so far are Painter (an app that works SEAMLESSLY with the stylus), Polytopia (so fun and addicting, very similar to Civilization but cuter), and Squid (great note-taking app, wish I would have known about it in college).My critiques:- I wish the speakers were a LITTLE louder. I've thought about buying an external speaker but haven't gotten around to it. I am happy it connects to my Bluetooth headphones!- I really miss the ability to play PC games. If they came out with one of these that could support those games, I'd buy it in a second!- I miss my backlit keys from the Mac BUT the screen brightness is so awesome that it makes them visible in the dark.Things I love about it:- Battery life. Holy moley this thing lasts forever. The screen brightness definitely speeds up my need to charge more often but I've been really impressed with how long I'm able to use it (for stuff like paying bills and writing) without needing to plug it in. It also has a speedy recharge. Very impressive!- GOOGLE DOCS. 100x better than Word in my opinion. I just love it. I also have it on my iPhone and I love the ease of accessing documents no matter where I am!- The look and weight of it. It's stunning. I love showing it off to people! My grandma thought it was just about the coolest thing she's ever seen.
I Love this Chromebook. I love the small keyboard. I love how light it is. I love the size of the screen. I love the resolution. I love that it is a chromebook, and I don't have to go wading through installed programs to figure out what is making everything slow down. Ditto for worrying about a virus or malware. For people who are still working on a laptop, man, I hope you have to work with some heavy duty software, because otherwise you are missing out. My husband has a straight chromebook and it is great, but app compatibility and the memory with the Pro makes this the bridge for actually working with a chromebook. I took an online class and was able to download the plugin for Adobe Connect, no problem. Although the mike was a little laggy. I prefer to work on this so much that I have really explored the wealth of apps out there to make everything work. It's like the undiscovered country working with a full fledged browser and the app store. So when other students are trying to figure out how to edit pdf files-- do they have to buy 365, or Adobe?-- I am already in Dochub. This is an expensive chromebook-- but it still doesn't have the monetary value of a laptop-- but when my kid spilled a cup of tea on it, and I could spend $150 repairing or ditch it, I repaired it immediately. And then I sat on my hands until it came. And then gave thanks to have my favorite electronic back again.
Bought this about a month ago and had to return the first one as a couple of the letter keys started sticking on day two. This one has worked well, but the battery life has not been good. I am lucky to get five hours. I did buy the one year warranty on the second one as I have seen numerous reports of problems a couple of months after purchase. This is my first chrome book after using iPads for years. Overall it is a decent machine and the price was reasonable.
This machine is lightweight, sturdy and has a simple beauty to it. I love it. I don't want to put it down. I purchased this at Best Buy, regrettably as it is cheaper here on Amazon. I bought this for the whole family to share around the house. We keep it in the living room and switch between profiles as needed quickly and easily. The kids use it for school assignments. I use it to cast up to the TV and just basic web searches and what not. This Operating System is brilliant. Everything runs quickly and well. It just works. This machine could really put a dent in the Windows and Mac world. Those machines still have value for productivity beyond email/web/docs, but the gap is closing, and this Chromebook is much easier to use. You will love it. It will force you to move into the USB 3 world, but then, that is a good thing. Simple. I was considering purchasing a cheapy Chromebook or Windows laptop. I am so glad I didn't.
Bought this so that the wife could have something to use to watch Netflix while I hogged the XBOX playing games. She loves it! It has decent sound from the stock speakers and the included s pen is really cool as well. Setup was a breeze and the Google app store has more options than a traditional pc. Battery life is actually a lot better than one would expect and lasts a coupleDays with moderate daily use. The option to use an additional storage using a micro as card isn't seen very often with chrome books. All in all I believe Samsung produced a stellar product with this one!
I came across a great deal on this laptop at Best Buy and couldn't bare to let it go. The thing that bothers me the most, and the reason why i couldnt keep this.... was, because of the truncated keyboard. its an off-balanced square design, causing the keyboard to make the backspace button much smaller. i thought I could get used to it, but the back button is smaller than your typical numerical key, and I keep missing it. I guess this is something I could get used to, but I feel I can find better options.Pros: the screen is gorgeous. In comparison with an asus I was exploring, this was magic, very vivid colors, clear picture and video.... good battery life, and love the sleek aluminum finish, reminds me of my mac. this is a big transition for me going from mac to a chromebookCons: That wonky backspace button/ truncated keyboard; expensive
Pros: Bright display, Realistic color, Lightweight, good stylusCons: problematic trackpadThis reminds me of Galaxy S, which could set the new standard of its kind from now on. The screen is very bright nice and crisp. Light weight and reasonably good battery life.The only problem is the trackpad lagging. If you come from Macbook you will be really frustrated. When you drag slowly the response is very slow. You have to exaggerate the drag first to get the pointer response properly. The double tap click is not 100% reliable. Even the regular tapping is not response many times. I also miss three finger dragging in Macbook which is very handy.The touch screen can compensate to some degree but the touchscreen reliability is only 95% with your finger. The pen is really the best but the productive programs like Google Doc are not support it yet.For Android part, I only tried the Hearthstone. The game performed well enough though FPS is reduced in some animation. The unreliable touch screen made me miss played my card on many occasion. This is where I found the Pen become very helpful (bonus is it make you look like working)I bought this or another vendor but they didn't let me post what I thought about their product.
This is a handy little Chromebook. I bought it to see if I could get a device that could perform work duties and also play Android games. It's super light, long lasting battery, and has a sturdy case. It is a bit light on features. No auto dimmer or backlit keys. I have found that the pop up keyboard in tablet mode usually works fine for in house Google apps but covers the bottom of the screen on most others... which is unfortunate because you can't see what you are typing.It's nice having access to the app store. I wouldn't have picked it up otherwise. However, Microsoft Office apps are "not compatible with this device" but Outlook, OneDrive and Remote Desktop are. Can't we all just get along? If you are google docs only you will be in heaven. I had to download another app to modify my files inside Dropbox. Lots of workarounds for me but if you want the potability give it a shot!
I would have given this Chromebook 4 or 5 stars as in most respects it is stellar. I concur with all the praise: Superb screen, fast and smooth as long as you understand the limitations of the processor, great keyboard, beautiful finish. Android apps are good enough for now and Outlook which I use all the time is incredible, so Google is slowly moving in the right direction and will only get better - patience is the key.The speakers are VERY TINNY and weak. I have low expectations for a laptop but this machine gets the prize for low end. But I can live with them considering all the other high points.Where I (for now) give it the 2 stars is a glaring problem with the trackpad that others are begining to share online: Inconsistency with click and select and click and drag. I do A LOT of text editing on my CB so this is an essential function and works like a charm on my Acer C720.Is this just a temporary bug that will get fixed shortly or is it a hardware issue? I don't know as the product is still so new.Problem for me is that this is a feature that I use so much, that having it "broken" makes the machine basically unusable so unless I see a fix coming up in the next few days, will have to return it. Like I said, I see others talking about the same problem so not an isolated problem to my machine. Will most probably return it and wait for the pro to come out and see if the Trackpad issue has been resolved. Good luck if you decide to buy!
I did not purchase my Samsung Chromebook from Amazon, but at Best Buy, and I have to say it is the best $400 I have spent in years. Super fast, great display, and the ability to do everything on it that my phone and tablet do, PLUS with the capability of a laptop. I have not been able to put it down. Now the kids want one, but they will just,have ro be content with their Galaxy Tabs for now. I now have a completely all Samsung product household and could not be happier.
Unfortunately, my lovely honeymoon with the Chromebook Plus has ended. This product is garbage. There are widespread touch screen issues that Samsung refuses to address (just look at the Samsung support forum). Yet, they just keep selling it. Samsung doesn't offer replacements â?only repairs. The process can take up to FOURTEEN DAYS. For a laptop I've had for less than three months. For a laptop they should stop selling. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this one.
I've been using this as my main laptop over the past nearly 4 months, and it's the best laptop I have ever had. I am looking forward to the Android 7.1.1 update, resizable Android app windows, better Android apps support provided by Google (4K video editing, photo editing, etc), hopefully also some performance improvements through firmware updates (also Type-C SD card to Type-C HDD file transfer speeds), one thing's for sure, Chrome OS devices always get better over time, of course as long as your display, keyboard or battery doesn't somehow break. Mine works great still after those 4 months of heavy use. Now for sure it's not super cheap, that's why I think it would be great if Samsung could lower the retail price to about $349, then I really think it should be a no brainer. And I cannot understand why Samsung doesn't sell this laptop in Europe, I had to ship it from B&H to the UK.
Been using this product since the 15th and it's working pretty well so far. It's fast, smooth, the stylus pen is a nice touch and I'm rediscovering my passion for drawing again. However, here are some things to look out for:CAPSLOCK; If you don't want to deal with the Alt + search way of turning capslock on/off, Go to Settings > Device> Keyboard and change the search button to function as the CAPSLOCK key alone. You can also customize the other main keys as you wish.No backlit keyboard. For $400+, it would have been nice.Smaller than I thought it would be, but that's mainly on me.
As an entrepreneur, this is a a great companion for getting things done. I prefer this computer for signing e-docs (because of the pen), for research (because of the screen capture and notes), for noting changes on design (pen again), showing ideas/videos/presentations (tablet or tent mode), airplane work (easy to maneuver, packs up tiny). I am completely in the Google world of calendars, wifi, phone, mail, etc. and that is part of the reason this fits in so easily.For now, most of the Android apps that I use are working. Some of them aren't ideally suited for the screen ratio and some of them just don't work correctly. I have found that to be a burden at all.
This laptop has honestly been great. I got a good deal on it by buying it through Amazon Warehouse, but I think it would even be worth its full price.First off, I love the stylus. I do digital art so it's a great asset. I have a Wacom tablet as well, so I have a bunch of different s-Pens with different nib textures that work with this. There is something great about being able to draw right on the screen.The laptop is very snappy and the battery lasts forever. I love that it charges with USB-C. I do sometimes miss the USB-A port with things like my wired mouse or flash drive. This isn't a big deal, but you may need to get new Bluetooth mice, etc.Aesthetically, the aspect ratio is interesting. Sometimes it takes me a second to get accustomed to it after using other devices. It definitely has more usable space for websites, though. I also wish it was available in black like the Pro. I didn't need a more powerful machine so I just went with the Plus, even though I prefer the black color.I didn't think that I would care about not having a backlit keyboard, but honestly it's kind of annoying. I like to watch my laptop to fall asleep which means the screen is too dim to illuminate the keyboard. I just use it in tent or media mode, but then it's more difficult to adjust the screen brightness.Speakers are pretty underwhelming. I find that I need to the volume to be turned all the way up to hear anything.The keyboard is a little cramped. I have small hands so it doesn't bother me, but when I switch between normal full size keyboards and this one, my first few minutes of typing will have more errors and mistypes.The small backspace button doesn't bother me too much though.But all in all this is a great portable laptop. It does everything I need it to do. It definitely won't replace full function, high powered desktops and laptops. I have a gaming desktop and an old Macbook Pro to do the things that Chromebooks can't do.
Am I just got too bad luck? The first one I got had two dead pixels on the screen. I ordered a replacement and found a dead pixel on the screen as soon as it was pulled out from the box. Then the 3rd one came out without dead pixel but a scratch on the screen. I'm lost, I don't know if I should try it for the 4th time.Update on 5/17:I changed the rating from 1 to 4 stars. I ordered the 4th one, and finally this one came out as perfect. My kids have been playing on it for couple days, no problem so far.
I've had this for seven weeks, and the touchscreen only works with a stylus. The touchscreen no longer works with fingers. Very disappointed. Purchased from a Best Buy, so I can't return and have to send it back to Samsung for repairs, which takes three weeks or more. Meanwhile, I won't have a computer to use. This is an issue with the product apparently as searching Google for "samsung chromebook plus touch screen not working" shows. Samsung customer support is dreadful. Waited 15 minutes on hold to get a rep and then was on the call for 35 minutes. I won't buy another Samsung product again.
Update: On dev channel (at the time of this writing) does support this high resolutionMajor complaint is the external monitor resolution support is not documented. At the time of writing, stable channel was not compatible with 3440x1440 is not compatible, 1/4 of the screen is a gray bar.
Styling-aside, no one should mistake this for a MacBook-class performance laptop, but what the CB+ sacrifices in speed and flexibility, it makes up for in battery life, convenience, and price.I have the pleasure of working across many different devices each week and have been using the CB+ for a few months now as a fallback, all-day WordPress editor and Google Apps biz box. For those purposes it's a mixed bag, but for the price of < $500 it's hard to complain too much: there is a lot here. Here's the breakdown from ~3 months use:PERFORMANCEAs others have said, if all you need is a casual email, web browsing, and the Google Apps suite, this device fits the bill and offers some great flexibility with the stylus and touchscreen. Once you get into more complex webpage renderings, use it for a biz where time = money, or intend to use storage outside of the Google ecosystem, things get more challenging. FTP clients are few and poorly designed, web page edits/reloads are slower than an entry-level iPad, and the ability to work across different cloud containers is often limited to the Android ecosystem, with its own issues (see below). In fact, as I am typing in this review box with 4 Chrome tabs and a couple Android apps open, the system is stuttering, pausing, and exhibiting an ever so slight lag when backspacing or typing quickly.DESIGNWorking long hours on my MacBook Pro is difficult with its sharp front edges. The CB+ solves for this with its rounded edges, light weight, and surprisingly thin width. I can throw it in a bag, forget its there, and use it all day without any concern over battery life. On the other hand, if you are buying thinking it is a cheap route to tablet XP, think again. The beauty of an iPad is its singular focus as a 1lb touchscreen you hold in your hand first and attach a keyboard onto at your desk later. Flip-book designs like the CB+ are 2lb+ laptops first, with software-accelerated passive styli designed to mimic the no-lag, active styli on iPad Pros and Surfaces. Its not the same thing and near impossible to hold in one hand for any length of time given the 2x weight, larger screen size, and power button you will grow tired of accidentally hitting as you balance the device on a knee or leg. This is 90% laptop, 10% tablet.SCREENThis is why you buy this device. Stunning and the showcase of the device. Given the lower performance specs, you could almost consider it a $400 touch screen with a keyboard attached. Easy on the eyes over long periods of working, with the flexibility of ratcheting up to eye-squintingly high resolutions when needed.KEYBOARDThe flip side of the light weight and thin dimensions is a squishy, cheap-feeling keyboard light years behind the clickety, tactile feel of the my MacBook (or even iPad Pro Smart KB case). The lack of caps lock and tiny tab and backspace keys make it a challenge to switch back and forth between this device and others. The absence of lighted keys (not surprising at this price) distracting when switching off higher-priced laptops.ANDROID APPSAndroid apps on Chromebook are a love/hate experience. Love: immediate access to local, offline apps far more enjoyable to use than web-based equivalents. Hate: apps run in a shared sandbox, one app crashes, they all crash out. While many apps do effectively scale up to full window resolutions, its generally an either/or experience: phone-sized mini windows or full screen Chrome ones. Apps are also limited in features, most stripped down to features applicable on a smartphone versus more complete feature sets you expect on a laptop. While impressive that developers have allowed their apps to scale to a full sized view, there is years of work needed to get these apps to a level commensurate to what you would expect to see on an iPad, which faced the same challenge of years of developers optimizing their iPhone apps for larger screens. In short, a great addition with strong promise, but years ahead of it to bring Chromebooks to the same level as their MS or Apple equivalents.SUMMARYAll in all a decent jack of all trades, master of none device for those on a tight budget and seeking a predominantly keyboard-driven, traditional laptop experience < $500. Anything above that and you're better off looking at an iPad + KB (faster, lighter, more versatile) or Mac/Windows laptop (faster, more versatile, better resale).
Great screen, crisp details, sensitive pen, responsive touch screen, and good weight. Lots to like for the price. Don't expect overwhelming power, but it's still snappy when brushing edits to photos, which is an awesome experience.
I absolutely love my plus. I honestly can't think of a negative comment about it. Its excatly what I expected. I did hear about some problems with the touch screen but mine works perfectly. The speakers have some decent sound behind them for being bottom firing. I bought the Samsaung over the Asus solely because of this screen and wow it is pretty impressive. Bright and all the colors pop beautifully. The whites and very bright and the blacks are deep and dark. The battery charges in about 2ish hours (or at least thats when I noticed it was fully charged) and lasted on a full charge for about 5 days with basic usage like youtube videos and emails. I'm not very big on the gaming apps so I basicly use this thing as a laptop.I've only had my chromebook for about a month now so I'll check back in with another review.
Love the stylus, make the touch screen worth using! Nice and quick when using a normal (5~10) number of tabs. It does take a moment to get up to speed when booting into a heavy chrome session or google sheets, but that is to be expected.
Does everything I want. Great for typing and music or movies. Harder to draw with the stylus, but that is probably a low-skill issue on my part. Would really make a great tablet except I don't like my hands pressing the keys (even if they're deactivated in this mode). Has great battery life, too. Why would anyone pay more for windows?
DO NOT BUY!!! I first bought the laptop from BestBuy and at first I really liked the laptop. However in the second week of ownership the speakers kept making a buzzing and chirping noise, the metal got all scratched up (even in case(somehow)) and then the touch screen stopped working all together. Samsung wanted $50 if they did a diagnostic and found that it wasn't under warranty (not including how much to fix it). I was lucky and BestBuy swapped it out for me free of charge. Now the new laptop somehow is even more scratched up and scratched up deep. Bought another case for it but does not allow full 180 bend. Would not recommend product. Even thought the screen is amazing and it does run android apps pretty well, Samsung missed its mark on build quality and unfortunately makes me question buying another Samsung product. I really wanted to like this product.
This is my first significant product review, but after spending a week with the device I thought I would offer my thoughts. I bought it mainly as a light cheap, beater device to do web browsing, minor productivity, and wanted stylus specifically for MS OneNoteTLDR: Great value for inking and minor productivity if bought refurbished. Pros: Light, good screen, tolerable keyboard, all day battery life on low brightness settings (8-10hrs), stylus is good in OneNote Cons: No USBA ports, As of 6/24/17, NO NATIVE MICROSOFT OFFICE SUPPORT from playstore (see below). Must be sideloaded in developer mode. Freezes/slows at >8-9 tabs in chrome.Hardware:Build: All aluminum, initial impression is good, though torx screws on bottom of device get loose quicklyI/O: 2x usbc ports allows charging from either side, headphone jack works fineKeyboard/Trackpad: Keyboard is mushy but tolerable. No backlight. Major complaint is small backspace key, but I have gotten used to it pretty quickly. Trackpad generally works.Screen: Stellar and bright enough to use outsideSpeakers: Downfiring, generally OK but not greatPerformance: Has generally been fine when working exclusively in chrome. My unit does tend to freeze/slow down when I have more than 9ish tabs open in chrome in addition to a couple of apps like slack and onenote so this is not a device for heavy multitaskers.Software:ChromeOS: Works fine. After some tweaks, I WAS able to connect it to enterprise WPA, though with some difficulty.Play Store: Works great! As of 6/24/17 you can only adjust app window sizes to full screen half screen or minimized, but it was fine for my use with one major caveat.As of 6/24/17, does NOT natively support MIcrosoft Office. OneNote, Word, Excel play store apps must be sideloaded in developer mode. Microsoft has arbitrarily decided that it will not support Android Microsoft apps on any device >10" in size. This is very unfortunate as I bought this specifically to use it for OneNote and as far as I can tell, OneNote offers the smoothest inking experience on this device. Squid works pretty well too.Conclusion:It takes some work, but this functions well as secondary lightweight device for MS onenote and light productivity on enterprise networks. However, it take quite a bit of googling to figure out how to sideload microsoft office.Other tips:-When I first received my refurbished unit, it would not power on and the LED indicator was flashing blue, red, and white. I'm not sure what state this indicates, but if you powerwash the device (Esc+Refresh+power button) and plug the device in, the LED will turn solid red and the device will charge. After fully charging it (about 4 hours), you will be able to power on the device normally.-Ubuntu on this device seems to be doable, but the drivers are not perfect....yet
Purchased five of these for a project here and had to send two of them back to Samsung for failing keyboards after less than a week.
I loved this chromebook until the phantom touch screen problem became overwhelming. Basically, the screen goes crazy, randomly opening/closing windows/tabs and clicking links. It is infuriating. It did it once in awhile early on (but already outside the Amazon return period), but over the last week, it's started happening regularly, and I'm done. Looking at other reviewers' problems with Samsung customer support, I'll probably just cut my losses, and move on to a different machine from a different manufacturer. This was my first Samsung product ever, and it will probably be my last. You can take your chances with this product, but there are a lot of reviews detailing this same problem. I would steer clear of it.
I bought one of these because I normally love Google/Samsung and love my Android phone. Iâm not a fan of Apple so I don't think their products are better than the Chromebook - I hate Apple products probably equally as much as I hated my Chromebook which I returned after discovering itâs useless for my purposes. I realized that it's basically like a large mobile phone, and you can't access certain websites, at least not the desktop version of websites, and this was an absolute deal breaker for me. Even if there is an app available, its usually very limited. I wanted to install the Brave browser and all I could get for it was an app which was extremely limited and wouldn't let me use the extensions I want. Instead it's better to buy a Rasberry Pi and run Rasberrian on it because they have about the same amount of power. In fact the Pi is better in many ways. For example, the Pi is only 1/10 the price, takes up less space, is more energy efficient, can access desktop versions of websites, run desktop apps, has an ethernet port and with this useless Chromebook I had to waste money on a multi-port hub adapter for $120 which I will probably donate to charity. Don't make the same mistake as me thinking you can install Linux onto it or boot from it off a thumb drive. Itâs not that easy and wasnât worth the struggle of trying IMO. The people saying itâs easy are talking about doing it on the regular Chromebook with the Intel chip. Although they're fast, I feel Intel chips are less secure these days and I'm shifting more of my systems to ARM. I was going to try installing crouton until I found out that itâs being deprecated and apparently Google plans to stop making the Chromebook altogether and change the Chrome OS into a hybrid of Android and Chrome OS. Another big reason to avoid all versions of the Chromebook.
Mine also had the Phantom Touchscreen issue beginning after about 4 months of use. Took it back to Best Buy, they sent it off, it came back in less than two weeks with a replaced screen and no charge because they deal with Samsung So I don't have to. So far so good with the fix.If you are in the US and are having issues, take it to Best Buy. They can help whether you purchased thru them or not.Other than that, it has been a great little machine!
Great device. Looks good and performs well. No regrets with this purchase. This is my second Chromebook, I still have, and use, a Windows laptop but despair of the issues that these devices have. The Chromebook is just a simple appliance, which is what I want most of the time.
ProsThe screen is amazingThe design is really slickThe size ang weight makes is truly portableIts fastMost Android apps works greatConsBattery is only okThe keyboardThe speakers are way lower then on my phone
My second Chromebook and my new favorite laptop. I use Linux and Mac for work. I wanted a general purpose laptop for web browsing and checking email. The Samsung Chromebook Plus is a great value. If you are looking for a gaming laptop or are not comfortable with Google applications (Drive, Docs, Sheets, etc.) then you might not want to get a Chromebook.
I bought and then returned this product twice. The first time, the touch screen stoped working, the second time the screen (display contence) continuously jittered. It is unbelievable a major player like Samsung would release this with so many bugs.
consolidated on this. Got rid of my old chrome book and tablet. Love it. Apps are working great.
I LOVE all the functionality of this chromebook. It is fast and does exactly what I need. However, the exterior had scratches within days. The finish on the outside (although it looks nice) is very cheap. Also, the Samsung letters on the outside have already started falling off :/ such a bummer because I really love this chromebook. Definitely get a case!
I didn't order my chromebook plus through Amazon, I got it from Best Buy. I purchased this chromebook mainly to annotate PDFs for coursework as a substitute for printing hundreds of pages per semester, which would ultimately end up in the garbage or storage along with all of my notes. This chromebook is extremely practical for this usage. The stylus is precise and works well to annotate with numerous programs that are smoothly integrated with google drive, making for easy document importation. There was a three year gap from the last time I used a chromebook and my purchase of this one, and the improvements to the chrome OS are amazing. There is a huge increase in functionality offline due to its capability to run programs from the playstore (including all the microsoft office programs if you're not big on google's rendition). It's basically as useful as a computer with a "real" operating system. I had originally intended to use it alongside my macbook air, but I have found that I've been using my air less and less. There are a few things that I don't love though. The battery life could be better, and I wish I had realized that it's USB ports are USB type C. In terms of software, it randomly crashes sometimes. I think that when the RAM is overloaded instead of just slowing down to a crawl like your average computer, it crashes and closes everything. Not a huge problem, since it's constantly automatically saving whatever you're working on but it's annoying.
My quick 1 month review:Pros:1) overall build quality - light weight and solid feel2) best thing is its screen - for its resolution and aspect ratio.3) practical 2-in-1 form factor4) ready to run android apps5) fanless6) battery life - wish it could be longer but good enough considering its weightCons:1) touch screen not accurate enough2) cheap keyboard3) Chrome OS needs to improve (that's Google's job)
Garbage. Just like cheap chinese crap but at a premium price. Started developing a random reboot problem after only 6 months. It didn't get bad enough to address until just after my 1 year warranty was up. Even now it probably only happens every 15 minutes or so, enough to make the laptop useless, but not enough for customer service to be able to reproduce the problem.I'm not buying Samsung again. Get something cheaper. You're just as likely to get a lemon, but you won't have lost as much money.
Never buying another Samsung product. I purchased this shortly after it was released from Best Buy. A section of the screen goes dim occasionally (opening/closing adjusting angle) and the right USB-C port stopped working. Customer support is terrible and looks like I'm going to be without a computer for a few weeks until it's repaired.
Not as fast as my laptop. But very lightweight & good to take when I go to a coffee shop or to class.
I've owned this for two weeks, and I'm right at the end of the return period, waffling between keeping it and taking it back. I think I'll keep it, because the positives outweight the negatives ... slightly. Read on.Positives:- Very light. At 2.4 lbs, it's practically made of feathers.- Fantastic screen. Insanely high-res, very bright, and the 3:2 aspect ratio is great for this screen size. Side-by-side windows display fine too--plenty of room.- The keyboard feels pretty good. I'd have liked a little more key travel, but it's a very thin machine, so I understand the trade-off, and don't really mind. I wish the backspace key were bigger, as lots of others do. It's very easy to miss when typing.- The trackpad feels pretty good too, and is decently large. It's not the size of Texas, like you might find on a MacBook, but it's big enough. Physical clicks are possible only along the bottom half or so, but light taps work anywhere, as is the norm. Feels good in general.- Reasonably fast performance for the price. The Plus has an ARM hexa-core chip. I don't have a same-gen Intel Chromebook on hand to benchmark against, but it's fast enough for most of the light work and web browsing I've been doing on it. Some instances of lag, but nothing deal-breaking.Negatives, and instances of bugginess:- The battery life isn't the advertised 10 hours. It's more like 6-7 hours, mostly doing light web browsing.- The build quality's not that great. If you grip the right-hand side of the keyboard area, you can feel some give, as the bottom half and the top half squeeze together. There's an audible creak during this too.- When using the stylus, there's no palm rejection, meaning you can't rest your palm on the screen while writing or drawing, because it'll register as touch input. I understand most phones and tablets don't have palm rejection either, but their screens are much smaller, and thus easier to avoid touching. The Plus's screen is huge by comparison, and your paws are guaranteed to touch it while stylus-ing, especially in tablet mode. This limits the built-in stylus's usefulness quite a bit. It's a nice bullet point in Samsung's marketing, but that's about it.- A general Chrome OS gripe: for something billed as a tool that makes great use of the net and eschews large local storage, it's terrible at working with remote shares. Google's SMB app doesn't display thumbnails in remote shares, and when copying large files (or many smaller files), it fails partway through. Chromebooks have been around forever now--how is it still this bad in 2017?- The folding screen / tablet mode has been buggy for me so far. In one instance, when folding the screen back all the way, all my running apps crashed and disappeared. This was in an account with no third-party add-ons installed--totally clean. In another instance, folding back the screen failed to enter tablet mode fully: the UI wouldn't re-orient based on the Chromebook's orientation. Following that, after folding the screen back to its normal position, keyboard input failed to re-enable, necessitating a reboot. I've tried tablet mode only a handful of times so far, but half those attempts have been buggy. That ain't good. I realize Android mode on Chromebooks isn't ready for prime-time, but this isn't even about that--this is a general tablet mode built into the Plus, so you'd expect it to work regardless.- I've had a few instances after rebooting where the wireless connection didn't work, necessitating more rebooting.- I once woke it from sleep to find there was no mouse cursor on the screen, and trackpad input did nothing. I used the keyboard to tab through my accounts and log in, after which the mouse cursor appeared and the trackpad worked again.- I had 12-14 tabs open at one point, which I'll admit was pushing my luck (I usually have far fewer open). Chrome crashed, with no error message of any kind. Just vanished. Upon re-launch, it opened nothing but an empty tab, as if it had no idea it'd done anything wrong.- Various other crashes, in all sorts of situations.The bugginess is all over the place, making me think that I don't have a faulty unit, but rather that these are problems with the Plus in general, and in some part with Chrome OS itself. Two weeks of light use with all the above problems? Pretty discouraging. I think I just talked myself out of keeping it. :(
Bought it from Samsung's website because the delivery time on Amazon was too long.I really liked this laptop, but unfortunately the touchscreen was defective, causing erratic ghost touches and rendering it unusable unless I disabled the touchscreen. The same thing happened to a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 I purchased from Costco. There must be some quality control issue in the laptop touchscreen supply line (all computer components are made by the same China-based companies). I returned the Surface and will be returning the Chromebook Plus.If that wasn't a problem, this would have been a great product. There are different pros and cons to this laptop:3:2 screen ratio: not perfect for watching HD movies as there will be black space at the top and bottom. I actually love this aspect ratio, as it is great for reading e-textbooks, surfing the web, writing documents, basically anything productivity-oriented. It's also nice for android apps.Google Play Store: This is where you get all your android apps. Chrome OS has just been integrated with android apps and is still in beta stage. This one is a mixed bag. Some apps work and some don't. Hopefully more will become compatible over time. The apps that do work are more tuned for a tablet or phone, not for a laptop. Maybe in the future developers will try to make a Chromebook specific version of their apps, but who knows if it's worth it to devote resources for such a small market share at this point.Keyboard: I think a lot of people are picky about keyboards. It's a little cramped and is not back-lit, but I didn't have a problem with either of those issues. Unless you're not a touch-typist and consistently type in the dark, I don't really see much reason to have a back-lit keyboard, to be honest. I guess it's just one of those "premium" add-ons. Also, it drains battery life.Build: It says it has a "full metal body," but it feels like plastic. That being said, it seems like a quality build and looks amazing. It kind of has that rounded-edge form factor you see on the new Apple and Samsung phones. I haven't have an issues with the touchpad, just the touchscreen.Chrome OS: This was actually the first Chromebook I bought and have mixed feelings about it. Besides the disappointment of receiving a defective product, there are certain things about Chrome OS that leave me with mixed feelings. Chrome OS is basically the Chrome browser along with some added functionality like a file viewing system. Chrome OS's "apps" are actually just weblinks that bring you to the "webapp" of whatever you're trying to use. If your main goals are just web browsing and word processing then a Chromebook should be more than adequate. I liked the pricetag and the fact that Chromebooks run fast despite being so cheap. I you were to get a comparatively priced Windows laptop it would probably be lacking in the performance area. With a Chromebook, all you have is Chrome OS, so performance is not as important. The advent of android apps brings even more functionality, but these apps are still made for tablets and smartphones. I found that both the webapp version and android app version of Microsoft Onenote were inferior to the actual Onenote program on Windows 10.
1. Only after a day of owning it, the screen would randomly spaz out, clicking random spots on my screen and crazily scroll up and down like a computer gone mad..... all while constantly opening new tabs about every second. I could set it down, not even touch it and this would go on forever until I turned it off. This happened a few times a day and was the main reason I returned it.2. The touchpad is pretty bad (or maybe just mine). For some reason it was such a challenge just to click and drag something. The cursor would either not click initially, or would stop working halfway through the drag. And I kept my device clean so it wasnt because it was dirty.3. The outside scratches so easily. The is the most fragile piece of tech Ive ever had as far as resistance to scratching.4. This is completely my fault but it doesnt have a regular USB port. I use a regular flash drive for my colleges computers. I guess there is a solution however, just get a Type C to Type B adapter.5. The backspace key is infuriating. Its so small compared to every other keyboard Ive ever used, I would accidentally click the "+/=" key 90% of the time (cause thats usually where the backspace key is). I dont know, maybe you could get used to it.I know I just bashed it but of course there are Pros too..1. Beautiful screen2. Has the google play store which I loved3. Works great in tablet mode4. Samsung pen works well5. Battery Life is fantastic6. Thin and lightweightI felt kinda sad returning it because I wanted to love it. But I just had too many issues. Hopefully the pro version will be more refined.
Simply put I do not review stuff. In this case, I feel I must. I have had this PC for about 6 month. I am a huge supporter of Google and I am happy to embrace it. I love the style, size, and video. Not having a back-lit keyboard was a miss. I figured Samsung's success in the mobile industry would be a great fit for a Chromebook. I do not download trash, I use the browser as much as possible for apps as reading about the future of chrome it makes sense. I store all photos, videos, and music on the cloud and this book was simply a device to access the cloud (think VDI). Today we expect some very basic functions...such as WIFI and Bluetooth to work consistently. In a home with a smart TV, work computer, echo, google home, mobile phones (you get the picture) everything works great but this machine. At times it will show it brilliance, but consistently will not be able to stream a video or stay connected to a Bluetooth device. It is very confusing and I wait patiently for the next update to fix things, but in the IT industry 6 month is a long time and its time for me to realize this is a POS. I hope this helps a few people out there. Good Luck!!!
I purchased the Plus the first week of March 2017. I am a long time computer owner and at one time I was a value added reseller. In addition to the Plus I have a Mac Mini and an Acer Aspire One convertible equipped with a i5 processor and Windows 10. I also own a Toshiba Chromebook. I knew in advance what I should expect of the Plus when it hit the market and what to expect later down the road when the Google Play Store leaves Beta. So far I am one happy Plus owner and have no regrets whatsoever. Some folks were hoping for a backlit keyboard. I have had that feature on at least two laptops in the past and never used it. The screen on the Plus is so darn good and bright I can see the keys with no problem at all. Other folks were hoping for a faster processor. I didn't expect the power of an i3 or i5. This processor is speedier than I expected. The screen is one of the best screens with touch control that I have ever seen at this price. My son, who owns an iPad Pro with the addition of the expensive pen says he prefers the Plus for drawing. He's hard to impress. Dollar for dollar the Plus easily beats the iPad in usefulness. Beware of reviews submitted by reviewers who have not purchased the Plus. This a great product for the prince.
Pros:-It runs all the android apps that I ve installed without a problem-The keyboard and the track-pad are fine-Great battery life-Charges very fast-Fast performance-Good looking machine-Light-Great screenCons:-The screen turned off once or twice without a reason-There is an annoying sound that comes from the speakers from time time to time-Weak speakers-MS office apps are not currently supportedTo sum up: There is room for improvement but this is a truly innovative laptop. There is no doubt that this is the future. If the compatibility with the office apps returns this laptop can easily replace a pc and certainly a mac, for home and work use.
Had the Samsung Chromebook plus for about a month now. Build is good, and battery life excellent, the screen is stunning. Fast processing.Getting used to the Chromebook experience, not many google play store apps stylus apps I used on my 8" tablet -e.g. Stylus Beta and other writing apps are functioning. Have not really found the styles as useful as I did on the 8" tablet. Hope this will improve.
I got it knowing full well what it was and how little it was capable of, but I still managed to be disappointed with it. The stylus comes in handy on the odd occasion, but so many android apps still don't work with the pen removal launcher thing. And the OneNote android still isn't even available for ChromeOS. It does look nice and is build well enough. It charges fast and the battery lasts forever because you'll hardly ever use the thing.The trackpad isn't very smooth to the touch either. I could nit-pick the hell out of this thing, but at the end of the day it's still a dull chromebook.. even with android apps and all that hype, chromeOS just doesn't deliver when compared to similarly priced Windows machines. I mean, I could have almost got a Surface 3 for what I paid for this thing. Regrets.
I do not need words.It's really best.Lightweight, best screen resolution
Everything about this chromebook has been working super well. It is performing better than expected, particularly the (still in beta) android app support. High notes: The screen, the app support, ease of use, and the fact that it uses the same charger as my smartphone. Low notes: track pad is a little clunky (the touch screen more than makes up for this) and the speakers are quiet. Overall none of my complaints are anything more than superficial and I would recommend this chromebook to anyone.
My Chromebook suffers from the infamous 'phantom touchscreen issue' (Google/Youtube Samsung Chromebook Phantom touchscreen to know about this issue). The issue appeared after 45 days of purchase and it has made the Chromebook completely unusable. International buyers like me need to be completely aware of this risk when purchasing this product, as this Chromebook model has been launched in just some select markets.
I love my new Samsung Chromebook it's awesome
I had really high hopes for this Chromebook â?after all I was one of the early testers of Chrome OS a few years ago and pitched it as the ultimate alternative to OS X or Windows.In the early days Chromebooks cost less than comparable Windows units and about a fifth of what a true Apple laptop would set you back.While the latter example holds true (if you can get a new MacBook Air for around $450 itâs probably stolen) the former isnât holding up much. Just about anybody can get a baseline Windows laptop for around the same price this Samsung costs.True, you might not get the touch screen or the really high resolution, but you will get the same amount of RAM and, at the very least, the same SSD space (32GB in base versions, including Windows). Of course, Windows or OS X units do not come with the Android Play Store.And letâs not forget the case â?aluminum instead of plastic is a great plus.But the positives end there. The cons far outweigh anything else, to wit:* No way to upgrade RAM or SSD. Both are soldered to the motherboard.* To say the Play Store is a bit buggy is being generous. I downloaded several of my Android standards and those that operated did so with such lag as to be useless. WPS Office comes to mind. I opened a simple .docx 10 page narrative (no tables, and no special whirligigs) only to have it sputter and stall at nearly every turn. Half the time I was typing faster than the characters were showing up on the screen. Meanwhile my Linux box and LibreOffice take documents ten times as long without a hiccup.Oh, and forget anything designed for the smaller screens of tablets or phones. Those just bounce around looking for a place to roost on your larger screen.* Use Google Docs instead, you say? I tried both online and offline versions and found both to have serious lag issues. 4GB DDR3 RAM and there are still lag issues?* The case may be aluminum but it sure doesnât look or feel like it. Until a disbelieving friend thumped it she thought it was just more colored plastic.* Feel like actually seeing your screen? Go ahead and crank up that brightness and just watch the battery die in about 4 to 5 hours. My 7 year old Lenovo converted from Windows to Linux bests that by 2 to 3 hours (yes, I did replace the battery in my Lenovo but which the same type it came with).* As much as Google may state there is plenty to be done with this unit even if youâre offline, I just havenât found this to be true. Sure, you can piddle with Google Docs offline but donât count on anything being saved until you sign online the next time around.There is one sterling compliment I must pay though â?the onboard pen for note taking and artistic endeavors is genius. It does very well with one minor exception â?my handwriting still stinks even if I make it orange or fuchsia.Sorry, but I just canât recommend this unit for the price-point. If you must go Chromebook, pick a less expensive variation.
Bought this for a school laptop, but I use it for everything! Great for Netflix in bed, drawing, notes, and just about everything. It's a little hard to open and flip, mostly because it's so thin. But all in all I'm very happy with it
light & easy to carry
I got this 8 months ago - first impression was great when it arrived, but the CONs become overwhelming over time.Pros :- screen format, stylus, android compatible, performance, convertible flip....Cons :- Bluetooth is intermittent/weak, Screen dimmer has no setting between "off" and "Too bright at night", not enough ports, no USB type A, no Video Out, no SD card.Yes, you can get hub/adapter/dongles to hang off the side of the notebook, but they will take more space than the notebook itself, will add up to significant $$$, and will definitely break the port in time.This Notebook would have been great, but it is simply too frustrating to go without thumb-drive, mouse, SD cards, external monitors/projectors, and other peripherals.I hated to lose the screen & Stylus from the Samsung, but competitor product performs similarly, is smaller, and has all the ports and slots a normal user needs *built in*.
I love the Chromebook as a whole. The keyboard is decent, the screen is great. Being able to flip in tablet mode is awesome. All that was great until....... Wifi connection started dropping. In the beginning, I could reset the wifi, and it would work fine. Then it turned into restart the device, and finally, it just wouldn't connect at all. So, I sent it off for repair from Samsung (they do have pretty good customer service I must admit.) They checked it out, and repaired it (apparently replaced the whole motherboard) I get my new one back, and for two weeks it is great, then.... the same issue. I am waiting for my second repair, and crossing my fingers that it is fixed this time. This issue is the only thing about the device that has been a problem, aside from the metal scratching easy, but that is not a huge issue for me.
Pros:__________- Runs Chrome and Android apps.- Beautiful screen that gives you a 2400x1600. The colors are rich, sharp, and not over saturated.- Touchscreen works very well as your figures are responsive and so far have not seen any glitches that you can find on some Hp computers.- Web surfing with numerous tabs while using Microsoft still brings a quick response time.- A beautiful device for a Netflix and basic web surfing users.- The stylus pen is responsive to the screen. don't really use it though since 90% of apps out their do not need it.- The pen as well comes with perks such as a laser pointer, magnify glass, note taking, and some others that youâre most likely going to use, if you'r a pen guy.- 720 webcam that you canât go wrong with those hoping to use skype well.- The built-in google play app store is a cool perk to have.- Full metal body but still weights less than 3 lbs.- I found it cool that more you write on the screen the more the computer will recognize what your spelling layout is. Meaning that taking notes will be pretty common after a couple of weeks with it (I'm still sticking with typing).- Theirs a button on the bottom right corner that allows a multi-window feature. Itâs a useful tool for those who want to use the fullest of their screen.- 360-degree hinges which advertise exactly as it should. A laptop and a tablet.- 4 GB RAM will make lagging obsolete for basic programming.Cons and Oks:__________- For a laptop itâs a great weight, but not for a tablet.- Apps that you use (Facebook, slack, telegram, Pinterest,) will reduce the battery life fast. Those require the use of the CPU will make it lose battery life even faster.- The pen falls out easily.- Not a sensitive mouse pad.- The keyboard is too close together as you will be pushing letters, numbers, and event the delete button in places that you didnât plan. Barely any room between the keys.- The Bluetooth connectivity disconnects at random times. I see this when my Bluetooth mouse suddenly stops working.- Youâll need external adapters if you want to hook it up to an external display.- Not every app in the google play stores is designed for this computer. I wish I could say which ones but there isnât a limit on this issue right now.- Forget drawing on this as the lag is not great at all if the pen for drawing.- Battery life sucks as I'm getting 5 hours sometimes to "maybe" 8 hours (if i go into a power saver mode). This is using Microsoft office, Netflix, web surfing, music playing, etc.- Speakers suck, youâll be requiring headphones when buying this. Not much bass and at max the volume isnât anything to brag about.- You lose your pen, youâll need to buy another one as somehow the pen that comes with it is the only pen that will work for this screen.- No backlit keyboard.- Annoying USB type-C.- Pressing the power button will take you into lock screen before powering down (which takes an extra 30 seconds). You can change this but itâs still annoying enough to put it up on the list.- The accelerometer is very sensitive when getting this. Even moving the computer from one place to another sometimes makes your screen flip upside down when youâre using it as a laptop.- Big borders around the screen makes everything feel like your watching a Imax movie from a basic television.- Lag issue does arise at random times.- PowerPoint, heavy Excel and Photoshop will start to see some lag.- Not much for gaming, even using Steam is out of the option.- Keep in mind that not all apps are trustworthy as there isnât much of a security layout in the app world. Phones always had limits but a computer is wide open.Bottom Line:__________Their are a lot of bugs or performance issues with this computer right now. But if the updates fix these problems than watching Netflix and web surfing will be perfect for you. Under this layout, youâre going to get decent battery life, a decent response time, and be able to take it anywhere you go. Weight isn't overbearing and the image quality is spot on. For those who want entertainment and nothing more, than this is a good deal.Overall, a decent amount of apps still are unable to adapt to this computer, and is in no way a gamer laptop for those who want a little more power in a computer. Itâs a 80% tablet with a 60% laptop. You can do the basic of enjoyment but nothing in the high-end range regarding CPU programs / games. I tested this computer and tried to put it through everything I can give it to Verdict: Itâs a college computer where movies, web surfing, and medium software programs are all you need for the use of a computer/tablet. A lot of glitches/firmware issues but if they get fixed than you're going to please with the results.Hopefully I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer.
Disclaimer: I was in it for the Android Apps....I've been using Chromebooks full time for about two months now (Two different Acer models). I know that's a small sampling, but I'm on my computer all day at work so I've definitely been able to put them through their paces. I'm a huge fan. They are so simple, fast, and reliable. I have one big annoyance with them. In my job, I have two different Office 365 accounts. This means that if I am logged into one I have to log out and completely close the browser (along with all of my tabs), reopen, and log into the other account if I need to use it.Then of course I'll immediately need something from the other account and have to switch back. Desktop apps like Outlook solve this problem on PCs and Macs.That's why I was so excited to see that Android apps are available for this Chromebook. That solves my one big problem. I can download an app and have both of my email/calendar accounts easily accessible. Unfortunately, they don't work as smoothly as I had hoped. They force quit themselves several times during the setup process and just don't seem stable. I know, I know...it's a beta thing. Still, should be mentioned. Some apps I wanted wouldn't work at all.How does it compare to the other two Chromebooks I own? If you take price out of the equation it's great. The screen is excellent, the touch screen is responsive, the pen is a nice touch. It feels well made. However, I have a feeling I'll very rarely fold this thing over and use it as a tablet until the apps work properly. To me, this means it's not worth the premium. The $284 Acer Chromebook 14 is a way better value.Pros:-Great screen (I actually really prefer the 3:2 aspect ratio to 16:9)-Pen is cool, works well-Tablet mode works well, touch screen is properly responsive-Trackpad is excellentCons:-Android apps are a failure so far (I'm assuming this will change...hope it's soon)-Price (since android apps don't really add much to the experience). If this thing was $375 it would be the best on the market.
This is the best machine of its kind out there. Astonishingly crisp and detailed display. Nice keyboard. Fast processing. I will never but an Apple or Windows computer again if I can avoid it. Android is the new star for quick access, great battery life and astonishing portability.
The Samsung Chromebook Plus has many negative features.1.The keyboard is in small letters and this makes it hard to read.2. No backlit keyboard3. When in tablet mode the keyboard is locked, but the mousepad works and this stinks if you try to play a game.4. It doesn't come with any kind of file manager.The positives. Nice full HD screen. If you only surf the net and don't store files I guess it could work.I thought it was awful so I took it back to the store and I spent more money and bought a Lenovo Flex 5 14inch laptop with backlit keyboard, 256 solid state hard drive, and 8gb of ram with windows 10.
I just got this chromebook yesterday. It is so impressive, and you can not even imagine how the pen works perfectly with both the apps and the chrome Os. When I show it to my friends in class, one of them went to bestbuy right away. After a full day use of this chromebook, the long battery life is what I did't expect, and overall, the system didn't slow down obviously when I have many apps opened in the back. Great build quality. Keyboard is a little different from Mac, and there is no backlit. Since I use it as an alternative device, that's not a big deal.
This chromebook has a beautiful screen and is very responsive to touch. However I am very disappointed that I cannot download and install apps from Google Play on this device. I followed all the instructions in the settings on the device to enable Google Play, and it automatically updated the OS for it. However, after rebooting the chromebook and I try to install any app from Google Play, there is a drop down menu that asks which device to install the app too. The only device that shows up is my phone. Samsung Chromebook Plus does not appear as a device to install to.I tried selecting my phone, just for grins, thinking that maybe it would download to both my phone and the Chromebook, but no luck there. It onlyinstalled it on my phone.Has anybody else run into this issue?
Well made, looks very high end. Battery life is great and for what I do on the laptop it suits me. The Android apps work very well too.
Best Chromebook i have, android apps are a good addition to Chrome OS
- Good-enough performance for, web browsing, emails, comparison shopping, light productivity (docs, sheets, slides).- Typing is okay, strong merits to its smooth metal curves around the entirety of the laptop (except below the ports). Feels wonderful beneath the palms.- 3:2 aspect ratio, offers a taller screen.**PlayStore (android apps), as of 08/07/2017,Beta as software term implies, are yet to perform as intended.For apps (you may experience occasional crashing and or screen freezing requiring power down to reset, problems may vary from device to device).YouTube app, download feature, with subscription, works.Chromebooks seem promising, optimistic of further improvements!**
Bought it as a gift for someone. Really love the build quality and increased functionality due to Google Play being shipped out of the box. After using it for a little while, I have to say that I am not a fan of that keyboard as many others have mentioned. The layout feels a little odd due to it's shrunken size. I am sure it's something that you can get used to overtime but it's definitely a major con for otherwise a great product.
It's not trying to be something it's not and it's overall a great product haven't had any problems....so far, plan to update if problems occur. Have had it for a couple months.
Easy to use and very versatile. Strong aluminium casing seems just as good as similar prody\ucts wghich cost way more.
Works exactly as expected with great design and build quality. Even photo editing works great on this with the help of built in play store acceptability
The quality of this Chromebook feels good. Nice weight for the most part. I thought I could be happy with it. But turned out to be a lemonWhat I did not like:1) the touch pad seemed quirky.2) outside scratches way too easily.3) stopped working after three days.The thing stopped taking a charge and would not boot up.
Godly speed in boot ups, and can handle most productive applications easily. Would totally recommend to any student or colleague.
Great computer. Extremely responsive, quick boots, great touchscreen and stylus, first rate.
It`s been one of the best Inversments I have done. It feels good and it works good.
The Chromebook Plus meets what I expect.
Love it. Great screen, nice size and Android apps work well.
Smooth. Works great better than expected.
Display image flickered and wobbled. Internet research indicated this is a known issue. Unit returned but only repair not replacement offered since purchased from USA for delivery to Australia. Disappointing.
I own several Chromebooks. This has a great, bright screen like my Pixel LS 2015. Another reviewer said that the web pages load slow and I have to agree. So much so, I will be returning this. I ran several tests side by side with my much older and slower CPU Chromebooks running the same latest version of Chrome OS on the same network. The Samsung web pages took 5-10 seconds longer to render. It is painful to wait for every page. Not sure why this is happening. I will try the Pro version when it comes out and maybe they will have this fixed in that one. Makes no sense why. Save yourself the pain on this one.
This is the only chromebook I have ever regretted buying, and the most expensive. The wi-fi will randomly drop, requiring a hard reset to work again. On a chromebook. Which without wi-fi is basically useless, even with a couple half-working android apps. Despite it's amazing screen quality, build and stylus, having half-assed wi-fi makes this device effectively useless. And I've read around, I know I am not the only one affected.
Provides a fall better experience as a tablet compared to my old iPad. Support for Google Play apps made all the difference! However, I still find issues extending display to a 2nd monitor, and maintaining hotspot session with my iPhone.
Stopped working after one month. Now I'm out $400 and i can't return it!
I have had this Chromebook for a little over a week now, and I must say that I am disappointed. First, let me state that the product itself is made of superb quality. The entire device is made of thin panels of aluminium, with the exception of the keyboard. However, my device came with ridiculous amount of flex within the bottom right side of the Chromebook. I figured this could be just mine, so getting a replacement could fix this. Secondly, the screen is great. It comes with the native resolution of 2400 by 1600, and can get as bright as 400 nits, which is beautifully amazing, BUT, I have found out that you cannot utilize this resolution due to the internal processing power being too week. It comes with Samsung's own ARM processor, which is a low voltage processor that would be better suited for a android tablet. Lastly, the most atrocious thing about this device is the keyboard. It is so godawful that I rather trash it and use this device in tablet mode only. The keys, for my sake at least, constantly got stuck and felt cheaper than a keyboard found on a sub $200 Chromebook.Pros--Good Build Quality-Best Screen I have seen on a Chromebook-2 in 1 functionality that works fairly wellCons-Terrible keyboard (seriously, I cannot stress enough on how bad it is)-ARM processor is weak and limits this device-$400 price tag is not justifiableAll in all, this device was very underwhelming to me. I have decided to return it. Thank the good Lord upstairs that Amazon is an amazing service that allows such actions.
Like many others, I am having too many WiFi issues. Most of them are failure to connect or "out of range" but other Samsung devices such as my Galaxy phone and 10.1 tablet do not have these problems. The problems are ameliorated by rebooting. Good news is that reboot is quick.I like everything else about it. Others who are having this WiFi problem have rated this device one Star. I can understand why.
I bought the Chromebook plus the morning it came out. I was really excited to have something portable for work. However, after using it for a couple months I'm not really impressed. I have constant issues with the WiFi ( all my other devices n the house don't have any issue ) and the pen already broke with normal use and is now stuck inside the machine. I can't exchange or return it because it's past the date. It's cheaply made and constant issues of freezing, wifi connection, screen moving on its own, etc. I had sent it in to Samsung twice and they refused to fix the system. Don't recommend. Put your money elsewhere
Go with the flip, have had probs with two samsung chromebooks both were display related and had to send back, very disappointed.
It's good!But there are some inconveniences in using Korean programs.
Mostly good. A lot of things done well but processor is too weak for anything beyond very minimal use. Which is really too bad considering how much I like the screen size, the pen operation, how thin the product is, the hinge operation, the amazing brightness level...
Absolutely fantastic product.Can't fault it,...
Great Chromebook and a Tablet.https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Convertible-Laptop-XE513C24-K01US/dp/B01LZ6XKS6
Ive been using this for a day and at first the touchscreen with my fingers was a bit buggy and kinda still is but it is very responsive with the pen, however everything else is amazing. It is a super fast device and the keyboard is actually not bad. I'd recommend you all to buy this but you should know that chrome os is still an os that needs work.
Works great. Daughter loves it..
Great screen, and given that Android apps are available I can now use almost all apps that I normally use. The only two things I did not get to work are vpn (to connect to my work) and some statistical software that I use that is only available for OSX or Windows. But for all Office apps, ftp, etc I have adequate replacements or the original itself.Very light and hip; the keyboard I am less enthusiastic about - it feels flimsy, but I am used to a IBM/Lenovo keyboard from the T450 series.ARM processor is good enough to have a decent amount of tabs/apps open (I normally have max 8 or so, I don't have 25 tabs open at the same time), and all the Android apps that I tried simply work. Also a bit cheaper than the ASUS competition.The pen is a nice touch, but thus far I have not really used it much.
I have never had so many problems with any computer as I've had with this. From constant problems connecting to WIFI to idiosyncratic ways that each app works(doesn't work) with respect to the mouse vs stylus. I regret buying this thing.
Same issues other are having touchscreen just stops working via touch. Still works with stylist. Machine is 3 months old unacceptable.
Want more USB ports? Want to use USB-A? Ethernet? Want to use an external monitor, keyboard and mouse? Good luck!I've tried four separate USB hubs from different manufacturers (j5, Insignia, Apple and Amazon Basics) and none work on the CBP, despite working on other computers.Switching Chrome OS to the beta channel did not improve the situation.This is a complete and total deal-breaker, and to be quite frank, Samsung really ought to be incredibly embarrassed. I cannot believe Samsung would actually release a product that lacks support for multiple common USB hubs, on a machine that has only two USB-C ports.
It's nice but the pen experience is horrible and frustrating ð¤. I've lost so much hair trying to use onenote with the pen. No palm rejection. Can't use portrait mode with a maximized window. Constantly inking in wrong places. Soft keyboard keeps opening. The aluminum and aluminum looking plastic scratches easily. It's light though which is great.I'd say this is worth more like $300 tops.
So far so good. Just know you have to purchase programs like Microsoft like an app vs. download the program.
Excellent chromebook!
Oddly shaped screen, over-priced for what you get.
Really good, I got this because I'm a student in high school and needed a place to work on HW. This is almost perfect... One thing that would have made it better is glowing keys.
Picked mine up on Monday from a big box store, which incidentally did not have it on display nor would they show one for approx another week, bought it sight unseen and brought it home.Construction is nice, I like the metal body, not too much flex in the keyboard. Hinges seem strong and the pen/touchscreen are very good.Unfortunately no access to the google play store yet. I wanted this so I could run the apps, not to open everything in a browser window.This is going back.UPDATE!Google Play is in play after a software update. This little Chromebook is working like a champ now.
I've used this Chromebook for about 2 days now and wanted to pass along my first thoughts. Keep in mind, I currently own a 2016 Macbook Pro and had a Chromebook Pixel 2. I can tell you off the bat that this is no Chromebook Pixel (one of my favorite devices ever).I'm only giving this device 3 stars as of right now (being generous) because as Google has said.....the software is still in beta mode. From initial boot up, until today..... this thing has resets, freezes and other hiccups all over the place. I see the potential though so I'm not going to be harsh. I spent about 30 minutes composing a message that was suddenly lost due to a random re-boot. Wasn't thrilled.The screen is as beautiful as claimed. Touch sensitivity and quality up there with the Chromebook Pixel. I was pleasantly surprised. The touchpad has a great feel to it and is as responsive as almost any other Chromebook I've used. Still doesn't beat a Macbook glass touchpad though. (I know it's an unfair comparison)Keyboard is just OK with satisfying key travel....but wish it was a bit better. Other reviewers have claimed the keyboard to be a bit cramped which I can attest to. When typing away, the small changes to key size (tab, delete) become apparent and its just something you'll have to get used to. Not a deal breaker.Been getting about 8 hours of battery life. So far so good.Hope this helps with your research. My opinion, wait until the bugs are smoothed out. Maybe by the release of the Pro model (that all black look too) they'll have most of this corrected.I miss my Pixel.
It has a great HD picture but that's about it, it runs smoothly but if you are a student looking for a reliable laptop this one is not for you. You can't really do much on it, especially not Microsoft word, or really anything that contains downloading programs. You also have to go through a lot of steps just to print, it took about a week and a half just to try and figure out how to connect my wireless printer to this laptop. If you just want a lightweight laptop to mess around with and basically just use the internet then this one is great. But if you're a student then I would look elsewhere.
I have not been able to print from it. I did what it said but still couldn't make it work
I really wanted to love this Chromebook, but several critical deficiencies made me return it. First, it did not handle video well at all: video apps, particularly those from tv/cable sources, buffered for several minutes, then ran OK for 15 minutes, then buffered again, etc. Intolerable, especially since my $250 less expensive Acer R11 handled the same v with NO video problem. Decreasing to 720p did not solve this problem. Second, the microsd card was not recognized, no matter what fix I tried from web sources. Third, Kindle books did not fill the screen in portrait mode, only in landscape mode. Plus no backlit keyboard at this price? Don't buy this inferior product. I am still searching for a Chromebook with a display larger than 11.6 inches, backlit keyboard, 1080p or above, that handles video well, and I am willing to spend $450, but apparently no such machine exists.
Was excited to buy. I went to Best Buy to check it out before purchasing. I was disappointed, I expected more.The size is awkward if you plan to watch movies on it. This is 3:2 ratio and movies are widescreen so it just did not feel right. Too bad, because th screen itself looks great.The keyboard is crammed and feels cheap. Not backlit either.Terrible speakers.The body itself is terrible. I expected nice, sturdy aluminum body similar to a macbook. It is like a cheap plastic.The computer was not as responsive as I hoped while I was using it. A spent over an hour using it because I was trying to convince myself to buy it. I just couldn't, it was just not worth it.I ended up going with the Asus C302. It feels more premium and is better in every way (except for the screen resolution).
The reason I bought this computer is I wanted a lap top with a touch screen, and what attracted me to this specific one is the description that the product can run android apps from the google play store. I have to say this is the worst purchase I have ever did! The product runs fine, the touch screen works well. The internet connectivity is very "moody" shall we say, it connects whenever it feels like it, which is 50-60% of the time, and I find myself more often than not having to restart computer. And now it is not connecting at all! The other thing that is advertised for this product is it supports a micro SD that can be used for storage. Turns out that if you load apps from the play store, The android part of this computer DOES NOT support storage on a micro SD card, and it only allows you to load it on the main memory, which is limited to 32 GB only!. Speaking of the android apps, not all of them download and run smoothly. I wanted to get my kindle books on it..... no such luck. the books won't download and I always get "error" messages. The last thing you should be aware of is the processor is not an Intel processor, and some reviews mention that this maybe the reason for the computer going slow when attempting to run multiple programs or open many tabs within the browser at once. My kids have older chromebooks from Dell with Intel processors and they run very well! Bottom line, as excited as I was to buy this computer, I totally regret my purchase now. If you insist on buying a chromebook with a touch screen and a play store compatibility STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG! You are better off buying the Asus with 64 GB internal memory and an intel processor. Better still, pay a bit extra and buy a Windows surface!
My grown daughter pressured me into this.. I waited forever for it to come available (pre-ordered it, then there was a long delay.) It is much smaller than I expected, not widescreen, feels awkward after using a widescreen Samsung Chromebook for years. The only advantage to its narrower squarer size is yahoo can't fit as many ads in your yahoo mail. hahaI have used it to watch a movie, the picture was excellent, but again, not widescreen, that's really hard to get used to.. and there isn't enough wrist support, so I can see problems down the road. The volume is also seriously deficient, you can barely hear it at all. I've ordered an expensive set of headphones, that was not necessary with my older Samsung Chromebooks. It also looks like I'll have to order a Chromecast Ultra if I want to view the screen on my television. WAY more expense than I ever planned on... and very disappointing. As far as I can figure, this does not work with Amazon's Firestick.I'm getting more and more discouraged with this "fancy" new laptop, it seems to be causing me way more headaches than pleasure!
It's trying really hard, and I want to give it an A for effort. I'm not sure if it's the processor or the newness of running android apps on the Chrome OS, but this thing can take a wrong turn into lag city really quickly. I've had numerous issues of apps becoming completely unresponsive, sometimes even to the point of crashing the OS. I'm going to be returning this and holding out hope that the Pro's more powerful processor and increased dev time can iron out the issues.
I purchased from a different big box store but I wanted to post my review here as most people come here first.Just a quick non in-depth but semi informative review :)First off, build quality on this is very nice and solid and the screen is amazing - not that you can really take full advantage of that resolution on such a small screen. The "recommended" resolution looks very good though. The pen worked well but I honestly didn't go too in depth with it. It worked as I would expect having owned phones from their Note series.Performance - Ehhh. Definitely a tad sluggish when in the play store and running android apps. I found that I had to exit out of chrome in order to do anything on the android side of things. What can you really expect from a core M3 though? I think for the most part, your average computer user should be fine with this. Also, if you do decide to go full on highest resolution with this, alot of the android apps arent going to work. Just a heads up.I had the laptop for 3 days, and every day it would reboot out of no where a few times. This may or may not be a software issue. This has been known to happen on several other chromebooks so take it as you will. I dont have the patience to wait it out so I returned it and grabbed a TabPro S (Completely different beast, I know)Battery Life in the 3 days I had it lasted about 8 hours on a charge.Oh and one more thing... Before you open the lid on the laptop make sure you take the plastic off that is on the hinge or it will make a loud cracking sound like you just broke something :)
If a beautiful screen and great build are all you're looking for then you might put up with its other issues but there's too many trade offs for the price. VLC for either Chrome or Android wouldn't playback most of my movies. In tablet mode the keyboard would still randomly let keystrokes get entered. OK Google detection was broken. I literally returned it within 48hrs. If the m3 version has a backlit keyboard and they sort out the buggy software I may give it a shot. I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this Chromebook but it was literally the biggest disappointment in an electronics purchase I've had in years...
Great Chromebook
I chose this Chromebook Plus for a variety of reasons, primarily the great display and the stylus. The Plus version is said to have a much better battery life than the yet to be released Pro. However I have a lot of issues with this thing being touted as Android ready. Every android app runs terribly and freezes continually. Overall the thing feels like a beta tester model, but I will have to reserve my 1 (or 5) star review for when Nougat releases.
This is not a friendly PC and the limitation of this product is not furfill any of my need. If you not familiar with this product consult and make test before buy this chromebook. I hate this product for limitation and breach of privacy and security are questionable!
Speakers were blown!!!!! only had 2 days of work on it go to eat and episode of Netflix and my speakers were crackling!!!
A hyped up tablet.
charged it over night. powered it on. during os update, the screen went black and would not reboot. holding in the power button for 60 seconds turned the led indicator off. pressing the power again turned the led light blue but the screen stayed black. sending it back. worst Samsung product since the note 7. buyer beware.had one from a big box store. it would update and boot but, would not run play store to install android apps.android on chrome os and the stylus were the reasons i was excited and wanted this to work but, it's not ready for prime time. I'm sad and disappointed. I don't think I'll be buying from Samsung for a very long time.
I have consistently believed in the solidity of Korean products, Samsung, LG, etc-- but lately it's becoming hard to me to ignore the consistent drop in product quality control, and customer service. Perhaps they made too much money and became greedy? Too greedy to stand by their products? Exploding cell phones, giant floods on my hardwood floors, TVs with burned out motherboards, and now this laptop which is the final insult to grievous injury. They should feel immense shame. The shame of their ancestors.Complaints:- SLOW. SLOW. SLOW. They used cheap components on the inside, making it look like Apple on the outside but giving you cheap Mong Kok / TST / Kowloon alleyway quality insides.How do I know?- OVERHEATING. The components do not work well together. No proper ventilation. I hold it on my lap and I feel like I could cook Bulgogi BBQ on my lap. Somebody remind them what it is they are building please. I don't want to feel like the laptop is about to explode on me like a Galaxy Note C4 Demolition Package.Final issue.- Android apps do not work on it. Are you kidding me? What a load of kimchee this thing is. Stay away.Buy a cheaper chromebook, buy a book, buy a Japanese product, buy anything but this thing. I want my money back, but good luck with that!!
Not worth computer money not all android apps work as stated
Samsung makes great TVâs but they do not make good laptops. The Chromebook Plus was not good. Overall it is kinda pricey and also it lags in performance. I think my older PC is a lot faster than this. It also did not work with all the apps that I wanted to use on my laptop. Some shut down others didnât even work properly. The pen sucks too. Falls out and has a slow reaction time when it comes to how it works with the unit. Plus it is a weird shape not a standard long length. Overall I donât like it at all and I like most chromebooks. Stay away people wait for something better.
So I have bought a lot of laptops both cheap and super expensive. I thought Samsung had good quality and good hardware, but after using this I would tell everyone to stay away. All in all the chromebook was SUER slow. I was expecting super fast speed online and I barely got that. I think my Samsung phone might be faster. The other thing too, is that the Pen falls out and can be lost easily, and it is kinda useless in my opinion. No apps or things online really need a pen, so itâs a wasted feature. Give me a better screen or more sensitive mousepad than a pen that doesnât do anything and falls out. The other thing is that the battery life is really bad. I donât really use my chromebook for much but the battery was dead in about 3 hours from web browsing and playing music. My 5 year old laptop has about the same battery life. Maybe it is worth the wait for the pro model but this model is no good. I do not suggest anyone buy it.
No back lit keyboardUSA keyboard
An ok product badly let down by Amazon's poor service
No camera so tablet part feels retarded, no LTE... Wtf??SAMSUNG HOW HARD IS IT TO UNDERSTAND.....MAKE A DAMN 4G LTE, 8INCH AND 10 INCH WITH A STYLUS WITH A DAMN CAMERA AND FLASH... OMG
Great laptop and amazing price for the specs. Plays games like Sims 4 great, and I use it for work at my internship all the time. No issues.
I paid about $540 for this which seems to be a good price for what you get.This is my travel computer and I mostly play Overwatch or other games on it in the evenings to pass the time. The i3-7100U is not powerful enough to support high end gaming on high resolution however on lower resolution there is minimal lag.The case is no frills but I have not had any problems with it. The screen is what you would expect for a non 4K laptop.
So far so good. I am a fan of HP. Nice screen resolution and has great sound.
Beautiful to look at and very Fast. I own desktops and laptops and they are all HP. This one is NOT a touch screen. There is one that looks like it that is. SO read the information carefully before you buy this. It does come with a two year care pack if it comes from Sams Club.
Love it. The keyboard has numbers keyboard with it as well and the keyboard lights up. I really appreciate that since I usually use my laptop in the dark. Speed is fast and has easy setup.
This computer is super slow. Also Iâve used it only a total of 10 hours max and already the screen is blank and I canât get the computer to come on. Itâs a piece of junk and I donât even think I can return it because Iâm too many months past because I had a move in the middle of from when I purchased it for now started really using it so I got screwed out of money have to go buy another computer right now at 12 PM in the afternoon because I have a deadline tonight.
Just got it yesterday but so far I love it. Easy to set up and works great..
Very happy with this computer. It has enough speed and memory for most tasks that you want to do on a lap top.
Great computer. It runs fast for my purposes(,mainly office, email and streaming videos). The screen is big and bright. I love the keyboard - its great and comfortable. The touchpad responds very well with less prodding than my old HP. I'm glad I chose this one as a replacement.
the compiter seems to be working fine. I haven't used many of the aps yet
Received item as described and in a timely fashion.
Performed excellently. Faster than I expected and the 17.3 screen is great even though I'm hooked to a 40 in monitor most of the time.
I love this computer. I've had it for a couple of months now and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
Love my laptop so far. Itâs everything i wanted when i was trying to find a laptop that would be a perfect fit for me. Ordered and didnât havenât have to wait forever to get it and before i knew it, it was in my hands. So excited!
Great quality. Love it !
I love this computer, it is great for my online classes with the large screen size.
So far so good really happy with this laptop.
Just fantastic! I was a bit surprised when it started talking to during set up but pleasantly so. Perfect HP product is all I can say. Love it!
Battery could be better.
Nice design, colour and good that it has 2TB memory while most other models have 1 TB. However, the @ and ' keys are mixed up so that when you press @ the keypad types ' and vice versa. Not sure if this can be rectified or if I would have to return.
Received May1. Performance has steadily gone downhill. I believe Windows 10 is responsible.Constantly have to reboot which is now taking forever. After the last Windows update it is virtually unusable. It is very unstable.Thanks Microsoft.
works great as it should, have no complaints, thanks
Very fast and large screen display
No complaints, this machine runs as expected
good computer
Love it
Love it!
So far no problems
Great computer my fiancee loves the color and how big of a screen it has.
Great item. Came exactly as advertised. It was ready to go. Just plugged it in and off we go.
The laptop is fine, works great,Except the backlit keyboard worked twice and hasnât since. This was an important feature factoring into the decision to get this. Now it doesnât work thus the three stars.
this computer is NOT new. I am extremely disappointed as it is very slow and I cannot get it up to snuff. first off - beware of CONSTANT updates. if you are wanting a new computer that is quick and easy, do not buy this one. when I contacted this seller and asked what might be wrong with this laptop, the seller answered back that to speed it up I might need to re-install Windows 10? SERIOUSLY? this was advertised as "new"!! a brand new laptop should be fast and unencumbered in its processing, and I only try to do one thing at a time. I did not return this laptop because I kept thinking once it finished all the updates things would be better and run more smoothly. WRONG. #dontbuythisone #betteroffatbestbuy
Very slow!
Slow to start up. I just need mine for photos and emails. Itâs fine for that. Just really a slow machine.
well so far so good. after receiving first one in damaged container. thing is price went up 30 dollars before I could reorder.
A new computer and had been hacked they said into buying a micro tech from Amazon at 500.00 was not happy. I was still under warranty and also had Norton so this computer cost me more than I had to pay.
Stopped working after 2 days. Sent it back.
So far Iâm thrilled with this purchase and the delivery was early!
I canât sign into this computer. It worked fine when I got it but now it says itâs hibernating. I want to return it
It's a great computer I love it.
I am no expert but I am very happy with this computer. The only complaint I have is that the sound is inadequate. It is very difficult to hear unless I use Bluetooth or headphones.
Excellent computer for the price. Consider this recommended specs for a successful windows 10 experience in my opinion. The hardware inside hits all the requirements for a good windows laptop without overkill parts. Since buying this similar spec laptop with an SSD costs hundreds $$$ more (Something is wrong with our laptop market), I did a $60 dollar separate SSD upgrade and this machine is more than twice as fast as the original. Highly recommended for those that are capable.
I was a little scared by the previous reviews on this laptop. But I ordered it anyway. Turns out the product is worth every penny! I am a software developer and I have been able to run all my IDEs with no glitch. I'll definitely recommend this laptop to anyone
The laptop never worked properly from the beginning. And I was unable to return it after one month. And the word "customer support" is an oxymoron. They are not supportive at all. They ignore your questions and do not communicate with you and just waste your time. Then they tell you you are going to have to mail the laptop to them and be without it for god knows how long. Which, if you are someone who uses your laptop for work, will put you out of commission. So buying this laptop for someone who uses it for work will be crippling to your job.
Flagship? Really? The boot takes forever (not just the initial). First thing you should do is uninstall McAfee and the immediately do the same for chromium. Reboot, then enter regedit.exe and delete all remaining chromium pockets and extensions. Then install avg. Also, take a good gander at the startup programs and unpin them from start. It will run 1000 times better.
Excellent laptop, easy to use, run smooth and cheap. I recommend this one.
nothing but trouble with this computer constantly freezes up I spent 5 hours with hp tech support and still does not function properly I am very frustrated at this point.
Maybe it's because I made the mistake of buying it used, maybe this laptop isn't efficient but 12 GB of Ram and a Quad Core i-5 processor do not seem to mean anything. Slow, lagging, terrible laptop. I do not recommend.
Not really what I was hoping for. Laptop is pretty slow for supposedly being the flagship model of HP, should have just spent the additional money for a gaming laptop simply for the speed.
Runs great, Very fast. Good value. For the one star, sounds like a lemon. I did not encounter any of the issues that was reported.
The best laptop I ever found. This laptop is powerful enough to do anything I put it. I can play games at high settings with no problem on some. For example I am able to play black ops 2 at ultra settings.
Its a bit flatter than the usual but not as fast as I would expected. HD quality is not what I expected and the mouse keeps flickering.
Something happened during an automatic Windows update and laptop stopped working. Had to send it back. What a pitty.
great laptop for the price. its certainly not fancy but its what inside that counts
Works Wonderfully
Love this computer, what a great deal
works well with minor issues.
Great laptop!!!
Great computer! HP doesnât disappoint!
Much clearer and faster then previous laptop
Extremely slow. I bought this to replace a 6 year old computer with a terrible processor and its slower than that. I installed Microsoft office on it nothing else. Huge waste of money.
Every time Windows 10 automatically upgrades, this notebook crashes and I have to reinstall Windows 10. But with the most recent Windows upgrade crash, I can't even sign in to the Welcome Screen so I can't do a recovery. This computer is 4 months old and still under warranty, but HP support it horrible. They keep promising to send me a link for a Recovery Kit I can download onto a flash drive, but the link never gets sent. I now have SEVEN case numbers in two days and still no link.. This is the worst computer purchase we have ever made and a complete waste of money.
Had this machine for 24 hours and had to return it for a refund. All kinds of problems. It was extremely slow (took 30 minutes just to start). Constantly making a loud noise; couldn't install or uninstall programs (finally had to do a factory reset); files that I transferred were corrupted and couldn't be opened on the new machine; battery was halfway drained an hour after unplugging (are they using old batteries?). Very disappointed.
Bought the same model in local store this month.The updated CPU is a quad core compared with the previous dual-core i5. The boosted frequency is 3.4 GHz which is amazing!And the 12 GB ram is really really useful.Love it!
This is by far the worst computer I have used in the past 20 years. It doesn't come with Microsoft office, this is why this laptop is cheaper. The product spec claims up to 3.4 Ghz, when you open the task manage it states it's a 1.6 Ghz, far cry from 3.4 Ghz. I bought this laptop to do word, excel, surf the Internet and read e-mails. This morning, it took about 5 minutes to open an excel doc. The fan always runs like crazy and the fan is loud, I can't figure out what is going on in the background. I buy a lot of items from Amazon and I have never written a review, basically because I've always been satisfied, but not this time. I will never buy a PC/Laptop from Amazon again after this experience. I will buy it from somewhere I know exactly what I am getting, I can try it out and have it supported.
I have been using this laptop for about 6 months, and I am basically happy with it. The one problem I have had is with the CD/DVD drive: it is extremely finicky to open. I have to do this slightly frustrating thing where I push the drive further into the computer and then push the open/close toggle with one of my fingers; sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. (Just pushing on the toggle button without pushing in the drive doesn't work at all.) Fortunately, I don't have to use the CD/DVD drive very often. I don't do gaming on this computer; just basic business application stuff. However, I do have a lot of applications open at once, and the amount of RAM seems sufficient for this: the speed/performance is fine. I am pleased that the touchpad includes separate buttons for left and right click (a previous version of HP computer tried to combine this into the touchpad and it was extremely frustrating and difficult to use). Overall, it seems like it was a reasonably good computer with a lot of RAM and large hard drive (1.8TB) at a reasonable price ($550).
I must be one of the exceptions. This laptop, the HP 15-BS158CL series, is worth every penny. I have never had an HP before, but it seemed to me that the company was reputable. With the excellent reviews given the i5-8250U Quad-Core processor by independent testers, I gave it a try. I am not disappointed and have not had any problems at all. It is extremely fast, arrived as specified, and runs like a well made Swiss watch. I have not encountered ANY of the problems detailed by other reviewers of the same model. I could not complain if I wanted to.
I finally updated to this new laptop, my old one was at least 10 years old. This one crashed after two months, my computer guy said the hard drive went defunct. Thankfully Amazon gave me a refund.
This computer has a low resolution screen. Flagship usually the best the company has to offer. This is not a flagship. Stop misrepresenting these computers!
Computer seems cheaply made and was slow to respond to clicks and keystrokes. Every click or stroke took a couple seconds to register, which was frustrating. I eventually returned the product. Not sure if the problem is the laptop or Windows 10 in general. Very disappointed.
My laptop came with a 1tb hard drive, not an SSD. Be careful of this seller, no guarantee that you will receive a laptop with the advertised SSD.
Fantastic performance for the price. I would recommend this to anyone and buy it again. Just uninstall the Dell bloatware and you are set!
Great price on a great product. Everything was as described. Has been a great daily laptop for my mother. This is coming from someone who does IT as a profession on a high level.
After reading many ads for a laptop computer I chose theBusiness Dell Inspiron 15.6" LED-Backlit-keyboard Display Laptop Bluetooth Windows 10-Gray.So far, I'm very pleased with all the features it offers, especially the light up keyboard.It is a sturdy laptop and appears to be well made.I hope to get many years of use from this Dell laptop.I don't give many 5 star ratings, only because I don't "love" things.However, this is one of those times it deserves the notability.
Overall great machine for a good price. Excellent build quality. Excellent sound. Keyboard backlit...awesome!Mine did not come with a power cable from wall outlet to charger/adapter.Display/Screen clarity could be better.
Bought this for my wife for Christmas. At times, she complains about the computer "hanging up" for a few seconds- where she can't open or close browser or programs - then it kicks in - I'm surprised this happens with all the ram, processor speed, AND solid state HDD.I'm assuming it's because of some bloatware that Dell/Microsoft in their infinite wisdom decided to install. I'm sure if I spent a few hours diagnosing and streamlining it, I could improve the performance - but when I spend money for a new laptop - I expect it to work right without me 'tinkering' with it. How hard is it for a computer company to build a fast, streamlined PC and sell it? Most consumers don't have the knowledge or patience to work thru these issues.Also, Wifi reception could be better. She'll be in our rec room which is furthest from our router and have connection issues. I have zero issues sitting next to her in the same room with either my Samsung cell phone or my Dell Latitude company laptop.
I got this specifically for a replacement portable office machine. Two hours after I got this I was running Linux Mint 18.2 without a single hiccup. It picks up my 27" monitor and all of my hardware. It did take a few tries to get the monitor into 1080p mode. It took longer for windows to upgrade itself and add bloatware during the initial startup thank it took for Mint to load upgrade and go into service. I've used linux in my office machines for several years now and have yet to encounter a crash or single virus/malware incident. Any important software such as Quickbooks that only works with windows is now also cloud based anyway. Bottom line, this is a great linux machine
This laptop serves its purpose for me (emails, movies, surfing the web and simple word documents etc). The sound quality does suck tho; so get speakers. Love thr number pad on the side. Only issue I had was a brief scare with it acting up and wouldn't allow me to log in, gave me a blue screen. I thought it was over! I'm not super tech savy but still know my way around for a little above the basics so I managed to fiddle in the advanced options and got it back - phew! Hope it's not the start of something.
Excellent computer, especially for the price!! I love this laptop - the SSD is extremely fast (startup takes less than 8 seconds), computer stays cool and quiet, backlit keyboard is beautiful, screen resolution is great, and comes with 3 USB ports. I downloaded the driver to dock this baby for 2 more screens and it works flawlessly. I would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone.
The SSD hard drive crashed after only 6 months. The tech told me it was an off brand, probably a cheap product from China that Dell got at a good price. Look elsewhere for a more reliable product!!!
I'm actually really happy with this purchase. The computer is silent and very fast. Boots in seconds. The keyboard is full size and backlit. It is on the heavier side, but it's not an issue for me. It runs great, the specs are very decent and the price was right.
Such an incredible computer. I was nervous before I bought it because I have some shaky history of purchasing expensive and luxurious items online; either they aren't in as good condition that the posting claimed or some other unneeded nonsense, but when as soon as I received this computer and inspected it thoroughly, I was EXTREMELY pleased. Lightning fast, supremely designed, and feels very durable. Honestly, I really would've paid more than $500 for this laptop. I feel like I got the deal of the year. To wrap this up, I highly recommend this computer to anybody who's looking at it.
Received within the 2 day shipping like advertised. At first I was skeptical because I'd heard so much negativity about Windows 10. I must admit, I do like this new computer, love the backlit keyboard, ease of use. So far, I am very pleased with my new computer. My Windows 7 was not compatible for the work I do so it was time for an upgrade.
The internal hardware I received is all correct, however the actual laptop body is not what is displayed in the picture! Looks like a nice machined metal finish and the one I received feels cheap and plastic! Very disappointing, don't order from Etekdirect.
So far, so good. I have had desktops all my life, and this is my first laptop. I am not a good judge of laptops. I like the keyboard, and I like that the laptop feels sturdy. I don't mind the extra weight--better than a flimsy computer.
I need help. Receive hardware failure message about the fan.Mtouyer@yahoo.com
We love this laptop Only after taking it into our tech guys and having them remove all the garbage dell programs that make it run super slow from the factory.
Good computer for the $$$. Had it for 1 month no issues. Pretty fast start up and great for students.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it. He travels quite a bit and has to meet a lot of remote clients. The laptop fits perfectly in his back pack and connects well to various wifi networks
very fast and love the light up key board
Super fast, small and compact but big enough for home and small business use . Does not seemed to have compromised on the features either. Love it.
Everything was just as it was stated! This is our second Dell and still love them! We purchased it for our daughter who is starting college and it is meeting all the needs that she was needing for school!
It's nothing fancy but seems to hold up out in a dirty welding shop. So far so good. I like the ssd drive better than a hard drive.
Great computer for my needs. I am not a gamer -- I just wanted a solid computer for work.
Computer is not as described. When I reached out for an explanation, I was ignored. If youre looking for key features like backlit keyboard or other specs you may get something other than what you ordered.
This piece of crap backlight already went out. I have only had it 5 months ans there is no return or repair for it.
It has a few little glitches. The sound can get muddled a bit. For my purpose, writing and doing ancestry research it serves its purpose well. Pretty easy to use so far. I would recommend it for some one who just needs a basic pc. Gets the job done.
Great buy for the money!
Love my new computer, so advanced and easy to use....
my Dell Inspiron 15.6" LED-Backlit Display Laptop is a joy to use
I love it, love it...so far it meets all my expectations. Easy to use, light, nice screen...and beautiful..yes it is beautiful.
I'm loving this laptop after having it for about a month, I just down loaded a music producing software onto it and am excited to get going!
I am a very satisfied customer.. my laptop is working very well..
The publication said that the computer had a backlit keyboard and it's a lie! There's no way of turning that on. Besides that, the computer is not the one displayed on the pictures, but black and looks cheaper. Dissapointed.
does not have vga adapter for external monitor
Laptop is good very fast and serving my purpose
Just received this awesome new computer. Definitely would make a similar purchase.
I've had this for 13 days now, paid $650, and I am already having issues. The audio didn't sound great from the beginning, but now it sounds like static, and if I watch a video on youtube, netflix, or anywhere else, the audio and video do not go together. It is not an issue of wifi, I have been to several different locations, and nothing has helped. I watch videos everyday, for school and for leisure. I am so mad that this costed so much and works so badly.
Great computer. well worth the price.
Great computer for a decent price. Cheaper laptops will have slower processors and will not be of the same quality.
I purchased several of these for our non-profit. The computers are fast and work great for what we are using them for. The SSD is exactly what we were looking for to help with quick startup. This helps our field staff become more productive!
Fast. Lightweight. Easy. And love that keys light up when touched.
love my new laptop
Very happy with my purchase
It came with ssd luckily its pretty good so far no problems
Great laptop but it misses brightness sensor.
Awesome!! Very fast!
Works great!
Excellent user experience!
Dell has always been my favorite!
Bought this for my wife. The keyboard backlighting didn't work, which is a dealbreaker for her. Had to return it.
I like my new computer, i got it to replace my previous Dell and am happy with this new one.
This computer is terrible donât buy
I was quite happy with my eight-year-old computer, but recently I was forced to update so that I could use one of the latest programs necessary for my work. So I bought this Dell Inspiron.So far, Iâm perfectly happy with it, but Iâll give one word of warning. The SSD hard drive is supposedly better and faster, but donât assume that it will be any bigger. The SSD is a new technology, which consequently must compensate for size. So, this new computerâs hard drive has about 240GB, which is, in fact, no bigger than my eight-year-old computer. So if you are looking for or expecting more storage space in your hard drive, then be prepared to spend some extra dollars to get more GB.
Love it.
Bad resolutions ,cheap finish ,cursor jump around by itself.The back lit keyboard is nice though
It has met our expectations!
Great, computer!
Hard Drive available very low GB.No attractive look......very heavy....not satisfied.....
Mine did not come with the SSD. but it came with the 1TB HDD. I am sending it back
I have Windows 16 not 10. Not what I wanted. Any suggestions?
Very fast bootup...about 11 seconds. Great graphics and apeed.
It is fast . Almost to fast and too helpful . Would like to turn off the cora voice helper . very intrusive in the middle if a project. the New word program again is too complicated less user friendly than my old. . The screen is beaufiful and surfing is good if i could get less help and interruptions . iI like the lighted key board.
Great computer ! Plenty of memory and speed with easy features. Really like the lite keyboard.
product seems gfood> what about the warranty in India??
I dislike everthing about this laptop and will never buy another Dell.
I bought this computer to replace an old, slow laptop. The new one is no faster, and is often slower, than the old machine. It takes forever to open a photograph or a web browser. It stalls constantly. with the "not responding" message appearing more often than not. I have had HP laptops in the past and they worked well until they got old. But this one is a piece of crap.
My laptop arrived in good time and so far everything is going great! Fast running and smooth!
Absolutely love my new laptop. Have always wanted one with a backlit keyboard. This thing is super fast too!
Itâs beautiful! Screen is big, style is sleek, keyboard & lighting is wonderful! Love it!
My son loves it. Plays Starcraft
Good size, Bright screen, Sound is just ok.. Now the bad! I purchased 2 of these laptops and 1 of them had Software Issues right out of the box, So I contacted HP and was told to fix this issue it would cost me a fee?? I explained that this is BRAND NEW out of box and again they said MORE MONEY!!! Are you kidding me? I was told that they DO NOT cover Software Only hardware! What Kind Of Crap Is That!! Anyway I thought that maybe it was just a new Customer Service Rep so I called back to see if that was indeed their policy, Yes I got the same answer ---> PAY US MORE AND WE WILL FIX YOUR BRAND NEW COMPUTER! HP IS A JOKE!!!!
Love mine!!
a lot larger than I thought....
I'm not a computer genius not very picky about products so this computer is perfect for me. I typically only use a computer to browse the internet, make Shutterfly books, listen to music, and watch shows. This computer is perfect for that. Lightweight, operates well, vibrant colors, and pretty self explanatory.
I got the computer almost a month ago, I figured I'd do a detailed review... I bought this as a quick replacement for my old laptop since it took a crap on me. So far it's been fine, but the keys stick A LOT. Not a big deal for me.. What's a big deal is now my mouse doesn't work because it's not compatible with Windows 10. Even had to delete it from the computer it's self. Very annoyed with that. You should buy a wireless mouse on the off chance it happens to you as well. Windows also takes most of your space, after the little bit I put on the pc I now have less than 10 gigs of use. Which is an upgrade from my old laptop, but I dislike how it's going to updates. I've used maybe 1-4 gigs all together leaving me with the 9 or so. There is a lot of unnecessary stuff, so I'd do a detailed uninstall / clean. It looks as described, the charger is easily replaceable if you need to. My last laptop had a cellphone charger-esk plug. Where as this charger is much more easily attainable. It lasts a very long time battery wise, and you only need to charge it for about 2hrs, I suggest doing that when it's about to die as your battery life may be cut short. The photos I have are when I first un-boxed it. The box it came in was highly protected, I've kept the box in case of a move.
This computer is excellent for the price! I purchased this laptop for my Daughter for under $200 dollars! I bought it for her for Christmas so she could play her Sims4 on it. With the memory that is built in it, the Windows 10, and all the updates you couldn't really download a huge game like the Sims4. So I went to Staples and bought a 64 GB flash drive for $20 dollars and now she is able to download and play all kinds of games including her Sims. This computer is made for just Web browsing, Work, or School work but if you have the extra money to get a SD card or Flash Drive and you want to use it to play games, I would suggest doing these options first before getting an external hard drive. I know my Daughter loves it. I also bought the rainbow keyboard to go with it! Now she can have it to play games which I am happy because that's what I initially bought it for! You definitely can't beat the price! One happy customer! ð
I like the laptop but as others have stated the space on here sucks. I wish can return it because I cant even download microsoft office onto it which is the one application i really need. Very unsatisfied with my purchase. I suggest you look around for better alternatives.
I wish I would of listened to the reviews on this laptop before buying it. I also wish I could return it.As others have said the storage is horrible. I have a constant low storage icon that I can do nothing about. I have nothing downloaded on the laptop just the stuff it came with. Because of this I cannot download any antivirus protection because there is no room. The battery life sucks, at a full charge I get maybe an hour of unplugged battery life. There is no internal fan to cool the system so it gets really warm. The biggest annoyance I have is after an hour or two the laptop needs to be restarted to refresh it. I was in the middle of typing when my keys stopped working, the only one that would work is the P and all that did was try to get me to print the page I was on.It is no good for streaming Amazon Prime movies/shows because they do not load all the way and buffer every 5-10 minutes.The pros are it is lightweight, the color is nice vibrant purple and that is about it.
Just got my laptop last Wednesday and right off the bat...Kept getting low storage messages. Turns out the storage was 25 outta 29.9 already used. Tried factory reset..nothing. Took this laptop to U.P.S. today..on return for my refund. BE CAREFUL!
This computer is good for surfing the web and working on documents. But you can forget about saving them. There's no room to save them. You can also forget about updating the software because there isn't enough room on the harddrive to accommodate the latest windows updates. So every time you log on to it, you've got a notification that it can't update.It's incredibly annoying. It was handy for my last semester of college where I was writing papers every week, but now it's just collecting dust on a shelf in my closet. Soon to be listed on let go.
Love it, love it, love it. A full size keyboard, with very limited memory. I solved the memory issue, by adding a SDHD card, and two USB thumb drives. I use one thumbdrive for business records, and the other for personal (photos, etc.). I have had my machine for 3 years, and it is going strong. No problems, other than the limited memory issue. You can't always add bulky software, unless you strip out a lot of other "stuff."However, most software solutions are online now, and it has not been an issue for me. I love this machine so much, as it is priced right for the projected life span of the technology (I usually replace my computer every 3 years or so). I have gifted this machine to three family members, who also love it. It is NOT a desktop computer, and it does not have the memory for a lot of bulky programs. But, nearly 100% of my tasks are completed on Microsoft office suite (Word, Excel), or online. Highly recommend.
Bought for my daughter to play games on. The windows 10 update took all of the memory on the computer. Had to buy an external hard drive and now works okay. Very slow, but gets the job done. I won't buy for this purpose but it would be great for web surfing as long as you don't need to save or download anything.
This computer was very cheap because it was refurbished. It advertised free Microsoft 365 for a year. I was unable to get a hold of the seller to get the 365. My emails were left unanswered by the seller.The computer is very light in weight. It is also very slow!
The computer stopped working after two months. Dont waste $$. It is very slow too
This was exactly what I needed. My daughter wanted her first laptop for Christmas. Once I finally received it (I will explain later) I opened it. It was well packaged and completely free from any signs of use or damages. It looked brand new. It started right away. I did the entire set up process with no issues. It seems like a very good starter computer. I am overall very happy with my purchase. After a few months of searching this is like a perfect match for what I needed.Now to the comment when I received it. There was an issue with the shipping that was NOT the sellers fault. There have been several issues in my area with local mail. When my package didn't arrive when it should have I contacted the seller. They immediately contacted me back and completely resolved all issues.
Ok I bought this for niece, she is in college and needed a basic laptop for studies ect......So far she loves it, though this laptop is certified refurbished I am satisfied with quality, it looks like new and works well. If you like me and really can't afford high end product but need to get something on par, a certified refurbished may be an option.
Unit looks nice, would be perfect for my wife to write on Word and browse the Internet.I installed some minor games. DosBOX. Runs great. I recommend uninstalling the HP software.
Purchased the laptop for my children and myself to complete reports, homework, surfing the web, pretty much clerical work. I have purchased a wireless mouse to go with it (because that is something I prefer to use). It doesn't have a lot of memory but it is enough for saving documents just not anything that has to use a lot of memory. Overall glad I purchased.
Bought this computer for my wife, just something simple to check email, basic websites. So far no lag time with downloads and responds well when operating with a couple of applications open.CON:Very annoying is the bloatware that's installed; I don't want Candy Crush or other applications installed on my computer that I never asked for.
After getting a nice refurbished desktop, I am confident with refurbished unit purchase. This refurbished laptop is so convenient and lightweight. I like it. Even it is not a powerful laptop for gaming I could still get everything done fast enough. Great
I got this for my wife. it does everything she needs it to do. I did a fresh install of windows to get the updates on it which was not very fun. i wish the HDD was just a bit bigger so i didn't have to mess around with it to get windows updated. i put a SD card in it for files and programs so the only thing on the HDD is windows.
Love it. It is fast.light and small
Got this item very quickly. Looks great. Can't even tell it's refurbished. Haven't set it up yet but if there are any problems I'll adjustt my review.
I love it. I shop and pay bills with no problem at all.
Doing great so far
When I bought this I didnât pay attention to how much memory it had, thatâs my own fault. But I think itâs ridiculous that I had to buy a hard drive just to update. Even after uninstalling office and deleting every one of my files I still didnât have enough space.
Bought for my daughter so she could do her homework without using mines. This laptop is terrific; it has the speed and programs that she needs. Very easy to setup everything that my ten-year-old setup majority of everything on her own.
We got this for my kids school, is a perfect e book!
great size, and color but less than warranty 20 after the 90 day warranty ran out the motherboard goes out and CS tells me their sorry. Well so am I for purchasing this item. I'm done purchasing electronics online! No recommendations here.
It's a bit slow but definitely gets the job done. I also love the color very nice shade of purple!
I wish i could send back. Battery acid is coming out the speakers and i oaid 200 $ for the pos. Thanks a lot.
I don't know what made me think this computer would be useful. It's light weight and pretty but had a hard drive smaller then my phone. Useless!
They suck so bad itâs not funny my husband got a new laptop and the first one was working fine the next day the speakers stop working then work aging send it back to order a new one got the one and that one was had a pice moving around in side of the. Computer evertime u move it not happy at all very disappointed.
Unable to add any software to this device. Any additional software or too many files and its full tells you to free up disk space. had to return which was too bad because I love the size, weight & color.
Pretty decent. Its not the fastest in the world and has trouble doing many things at once. Its totally solid for research and writing papers. I wouldn't get it a device to play games or stream.
So far very nice, a few of the keys were popped off but other than that , no problemWELL 9 months later itâs stops working right!!! Sucks!!!
Typical Microsoftbased computer, except this one was running an outdated version. Good thing I only needed it for running an app that Pads donât support.
Worked out well for our needs.
Not much on storage. Having a hard time updating windows 10 with not enough storage. Nothing to delete to make room, except maybe chrome. I love the color though
I returned the computer because it seems slower than the computer I replaced it with. So thankfully I was able to return it.
MY granddaughter is happy with it =)
Computer is incredibly slow and you are severely limited in what you can do with this. Only had it for a few months and just missed the return window other wise I would have sent it back. Do not purchase this.
We've had this 6 months and the screen is now going out. Would not recommend this product.
This computer does everything I need. Word, internet browsing, and Netflix. Very lightweight, pretty and functional.
Fantastic laptop, for the price, it works great!! Love it!!
Laptop is working well so far! Gorgeous color!
the delivery date was off because amazon uses UPS for the delivery but if that wasn the case and it was ontime i would have been very satisfied, i love my laptop.
the price was good but the unit has intermittent glitches, we have since purchased a new laptop
I can't even log on, this is the weirdest computer I've ever had, thinking I will return it.
Love it love it great for class work easy to travel with around campus.
Not happy at all!!! You canât expect much from this laptop but I would at least expect to be able to UPDATE windows. Nobody with these laptops are able to do it. Iâd love to return it but then it will cost me $40 shipping. Why would you sell something you canât update.
Terribly slow and no fan to keep it cool
I bought for my daughter whose going 2 college. It runs really slow
Delivered fast and packaged well. Works awesome!!!
Sucked do not buy! Freezes every Time I turn it on!
If you're looking for a computer that does anything besides basic stuff, you should look elsewhere. I use it only for writing and it works just fine. The computer is light and barely noticeable, durable (a necessity in my line of work), and has a long battery life. The casing feels a bit cheap, but can't complain because the reason I bought it is because my other laptop is so heavy. Basically, you get what you pay for; it does it's job for the price it is.
Buen producto excelente envÃ­o
I was hoping that it was purple in color! I understand that it was refurbished. But it was totally scratched up!!!!
From i recieve this laptop it keep freezing
Computer glitches and makes typing nearly impossible in some circumstances. Slow and internet doesnât work well. Google drive doesnât save... itâs a piece. But itâs cheap.
Just as you discribed, works great,grandchildren love it
I like it great price does the job
Amazing laptop !
Love it!
i like that is light weight, its easy to navigate thru. i think the price was great and i love the color
So far so good. No complaints. Works as expected with no hiccups. Did have a lot of bloatware but was able to remove most of it and have adequate space to function and run quickly.
I bought this laptop for my daughter and she loves it!
I ordered a purple computer and it arrived as a blue one. It was a Christmas gift for a girl. Otherwise it's ok; it glitches sometimes during the use of certain programs.
The computer was barley usable. I know itâs refurbished but it came with what appeared to be viruses already on it.
Fav color, lightweight, easy keyboard... Perfect for me.
Nice computer! Great value for money!
It looks pretty new. I just got it today and the sound doesnt work AT ALL! I tried just about everything to get it to work. Sending it back tomorrow!
I love it!
Processor Speed and Hard Drive Space
I ordered this as a present in the purple color. When it was opened it was blue.
I Received this product today only to open the box and only had half of the charging cord!! Not cool
No memory at all, will never order again!!
Has anybody looked at the battery, I can' t see how to open the back ?
Truly pleased would buy another!
It was cracked when I received it
Great speed fast updates awesome product
stupid laptop! its very slow, dont buy it pls
Ran for a few hours and never turned back on
Muy bueno
Returned, computer didn't work. The return process was very easy.
Kinda slow but works
didnt work, sent it back. they were easy to work with though
wasn't what I expected. It also did not work so I returned it the next day after receiving it.
You get what you pay for and this thing is absolute trash.
not what i expected
It's funny this laptop is called "Stream" because it can't even do that correctly! I cant get through three Netflix episodes w/o it having a buffering or the speakers start to sounded clouded and possessed. DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP!!
Nice product, perfectly meets all my needs. Love it.
It meets all my requirements. It is faster then I thought it would be and meets all my needs.
virtual memory was maxxed out within a week.
I love it, it's light weight, I had never use Windows 10 an it's easier than I thought it would be
Love it!!!!
It turned on two times and then never worked
Love it! My family has been all into its abilities using Skype Windows Wi-Fi and blue tooth, marvelous!
I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter. She loves it! I like that is perfect for her to use for schoolwork, and she likes that it is great for gaming and youtube. Graphics are good, sound is good. This is a great little machine for the price.
It works. It's just slow. By slow, I mean comparatively to the frustration you know if....you had aol in the 90's, you have ever tried to walk someone's bulldog, you had plans after a quick stop at the dmv, you needed bread on senior discount day at the supermarket, you wait in traffic for the exit ramp and sombody cuts the car in front of you off, race a donkey in the Kentucky derby...and so on.
I wanted to like it. It has much going for it. It is small, portable, cheap and easy. Alas, you get what you paid for. It has minuscule memory. I got an SD card for it to boost its memory, and that helps with storage of data and apps. However, there is insufficient memory to download and install Windows Updates. There are a number of workarounds posted on the web, but so far I haven't been able to get any of them to work for me. Finally I just had to turn off the Automatic Windows Update so I could get any work done at all. I am shocked and saddened that HP and Microsoft haven't negotiated a fix for this yet. I still use it and I still like it, but not being able to load Windows Updates is a major issue, and had I known about it before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it.
This is by far the slowest computer I've ever owned. Ive had base model Lenovo, Gateway and those performed much smoother. I bought this because I thought it was a good decent affordable Laptop. It is cheap compared to others , and it looks good, neither of those factors improves its slow, slow performance. When you first start it up the laptop is overrun by BS Microsoft apps and programs they want you to use. Blatant advertising, (perhaps thats why it is so affordable). Between all the notifications from other un needed products and trying to install programs you actually use, (itunes, opera web browser for me) this computer goes oh so slow. Not worth the purchase I would say, keep looking for a better computer. It could be worth spending a bit more for a better device. And if you have an external hard drive get ready for a major performance decrease with this computer. Huge bummer
Worth noting.... I did not purchase this dog. My dear SON did, for his sister.... And I got stuck with it.This machine is so under powered that it will BRICK on Factory Restore. I bought my dear daughter a far better machine -https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K1IO3QW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1These very cheap HP's will waste your money. MS has de-supported these cheap processors under WIN10. Please, buy nothing under an I3.... My daughter's unit got wiped, and tossed into the local trash :(.
I like the idea of this little laptop. It is lightweight and cute, but they made a huge mistake when they put it together: They loaded Windows 10 on this thing with a 30Gb hard drive. 30Gb should be enough for an operating system, right? No. No it is not.After installing ONLY firefox and nothing else, the hard drive is full and I get a message every day that Windows cannot update because there is no memory left. This is totally unacceptable, and there is NO way that HP didn't know this. HP knew this going in, and shipped the thing with a hard drive that is too small to even accommodate the OS.This thing is a rip off if you want to do anything with it other than look at email. You will not be doing any work, such as writing, because the hard drive is too small to even hold the OS.. This will be my very last HP product.
Don't buy this laptop. I am highly disappointed with this product. I purchased one as a backup to my work laptop and one for a client as a closing gift. I've only had it a week when it started to lag and freeze. Storage is horrible and other than how pretty it is, it may as well just be kept in a display case since it doesn't function properly. I just received a text from my client asking me if I purchased a warranty. Luckily, I can take them back. Such an inconvenience.
Please please donât waste your time or money. This product belongs on the trash and reported to the feds. HP should be ashamed. Iâm afraid to purchase anything from HP after having such a poor product that doesnt work
Had problems with the audio and with the system, it doesn't run and it freezes if the laptop is pluged in :( have to return it.
This machine is well worth the money. All new systems need to update as features and securities have evolved since the software was loaded. How quickly this is done depends entirely on your internet connection speed. I am very happy I bought this laptop and highly recommend it.
Great laptop for the money. Isn't the too of the line, fastest one on the market. But, you get plenty of bang for your buck. Easy to set up as well.
I like this laptop. This is the third Lenovo computer that I have purchased. The laptop is light weight and the keypad feels good. One note though, I could not run Bitdefender because the laptop did not have enough Ghz. It does come with 30 days of McAfee.Another note: the touch pad does not have a scrolling feature. You can set it to scroll using two fingers on the touch pad. This takes some time to get used to. Despite the lack of these features, I still like the laptop.
I have had my computer only for a week now but so far so good. Windows 10 was a bit goofy setting up. I called Lenovo and they wanted about $70 to have someone help me finishing set everything up. I did a few reboots and was able to do it myself.Iâm not 100% sure I would recommend this to a beginner computer user, but I think I would to a fearless computer user.Nice big screen and the keyboard has more on it (than my computer I am replacing) including 10 key pad. My previous computer had a very small computer and was very comfortable for me. This keyboard is a little more spread out so it may be more comfortable for a manâs hands.Anyway, does what I need it to do.
I ordered this because in the past, Lenovo has been an excellent computer manufacturer. When I opened the box, the computer was very sleek and nicely designed. It was the size I needed and the keyboard was very ergonomic. The problems started when I initially powered up the device. It began making a rattling noise like a pin on a record player nonstop. I looked through forums and saw the same issue. I went to Lenovo support and they said is was a common issue and that they were changing the HDD in them. The computer was also terrible laggy- I couldn't browse multiple tabs, the screen kept refreshing, etc. For the price, this computer is loaded with bloatware and unacceptably slow. It is a complete waste of money- Buyer Beware, it is not even good for light home use.
Very poor and slow. Perhaps i got a bad one and amazon is returning but it was extremely slow and would not even allow factory reset to take place.
great for the price.
Great buy on this laptop! Great price and great quality new
Yo. My kid was like "thanks for getting me this lap top for my birthday. For Christmas can we make it work better?"
I saw the bad reviews and i figured they were just for defective products. I got my computer and low and behold the screen barely works, it has huge lines going through it. Honestly this is embarrassing lenovo, it might even be a scam selling obviously defective products .
Good laptop for the money. Bought for our mechanic at work and he says it does the job just fine.
Great laptop for the money. Some licensed items have to be purchased separately, due to user need. Processor is slower than expected, but still good PC.
really slow computer, not happy with the item, be aware before buying the item!
Couldn't handle modest usage, havent had it more than 3 months and the harddrive is digitally missing and now it won't boot up. Garbage.
Runs slow
This is a really good computer for the money. It does run slow but this computer is more for people who require a lot of storage for documents, music, pictures and artwork. Overall I would recommend this computer.
Only got this yesterday but already super impressed and thrilled with this Ideapad! Color is great, easy to set it up and use. Very happy with my purchase!
Almost a month since I have it. Working well, nice old school-like desing, light weight, fast startup... More than satisfactory for the low price.
Very slow laptop.
I have had it for about a month and a half, and the keyboard already completely stopped working.
it works very will but i do not like the pad
Thank youð
The computer itself is nice but it is slow as molasses. Not happy with the performance at all
This is a great laptop it is great for school. It is very dependable and it is a fast computer.
Works well just have a few issues with the touchpad, as it is unresponsive at times
All the features are great. I love the colour especially
Really wanted a 64 bit computer. Hence it is a little slower than expected.
Is very beautiful color and i love this laptop
No booklet with instructions. Has lots of program cost extra data cost. I did put the music Deezer which you have to subscribe. Another to store files are complicated Format is definitely different from Dell, Acer, HP etc. 4 GB slow. Good size little heavier. Screen size good. My mistake to buy on line on Amazon. Return for 3rd party cumbersome. 20 % restocking fee is too much. I know they have to sell as used item 10 % reasonable. the dealer could have sold me 8 GB of the same kind but did no show much interested because I wanted an Acer 7 they don't carry it. So I am stuck & probably use my Dell.
Live the big keys but it is very slow...
Computer is running horribly slow and now won't shut off. I could normally take the battery out but even pressing the reset button, it stays "on" without the screen Turing on. Avoid. I. Glad I have insurance and a chance to return.
This is an excellent budget lap top. The build quality is good for the price, the color options and design are really nice given the price. It is lighter than other laptops that have the same sized screen, which is important when your wife is small. The laptop is not the quickest on the market, but if you know how to set up your laptop correctly after getting it out of the box, the lag is not noticeable. I bought this as a basic laptop companion, so we basically use it for internet, email and streaming videos. Those functions run smoothly on the device. We do not do anything heavy on the laptop. The keys are responsive and the screen appears sharp.
If I could give 0 stars, I would. This is the worst computer I've ever owned. I am returning it immediately. Setup was easy with Cortana, but slow. It took forever to boot up just to start doing anything. Launching the internet felt worse than dial-up. The internet application (Windows Edge, I think) froze while typing an email, and I had to restart the computer. I had a full wifi connection - so it was the application - not my internet speed. I used it for less than an hour and was so frustrated that I started the return process with Amazon (on my wife's MacBook Pro). It's taken over an hour to only complete "3% of the factory reset". I only completed setting up my mail account on this laptop, nothing else -- so the restoration to factory settings should only take seconds. Do not buy this computer.
After 2 months the software doesn't allow internet use. I was never told that it would cost $19 a month to maintain software support. I want my money back!
Slow when unbox and install a 2GB application thru internet.
No idea yet. It's hour four of updates. I hooked it to a cat 5 cable 4 hours ago as I thought it might be my wifi. This is ridiculous. I am at 49% of updates.
Worse computer ever used. It took 6 hours to upgrade the system, and its super slow. Crappy stuff.
Laptop hangs a lot. Does weird stuff. I'll keep it but not very happy with it at all.
Juts received it and I totally love the color. Setting up as i type and happy I got this computer
Please do not buy this laptop this laptop was so so slow it had Built-in virus even if you put the antivirus it won't work and once you are connected to the Internet you become hacked on all other devices in your home!!!!I am so mad!!!!
This computer sends me a message that there is an upgrade. Then its asks if I want to upgrade, it may not compatible with my system. Don't the company know whether the upgrade is for my computer? Not feeling this laptop at all. It has shut down for not reason and I've had to reboot the system.
Really awful. Super slow and buggy. I reset the factory settings, and it's still a frustrating nightmare. Wish I had just bought a Chromebook.
Great laptop
I just received this 3 days ago and so far the unit is operating very nicely, it seems to have good speed with most operations. I do think that the wifi receiver is a touch week but nothing of great concern for me. I have also noticed that Yahoo doesn't operate very quickly or efficient with this unit which isn't a big deal either. The only thing that I'm truly disappointed in so far is the color, this unit was suppose to be blue according to the description but instead it's a very purple unit. Ultimately the color doesn't matter but I don't feel very manly while working on my purple laptop, LOL!! I'll update if anything would change down the road.
Slower than slow. Confirmed the specs, but just not even remotely up to snuff. 2 stars for looks!
Not satisfied, slower than expected, and battery gets discharged within less than 1/2 hour
First it took over eight hours for the the laptop to update. Took another hour for the setup to complete. Once everything was said and done and I created my account I was able to use the laptop twice. On the third attempt the Laptop went through the Lenovo load screen to the password screen. Once at this screen the keyboard would not work the bar to type in the password would not show up to type in the password. I spent over an hour on the phone and then an additional 30 mins on chat help to try and resolve the issue. I was finally told there was nothing they could do for me as it appears to be a software issue.The laptop worked great for the first two rimes I was able to use it. The time frame for this issue to appear was one week after unboxing. I do not recommend this item.
I've had computer only 2 1/2 months, had added new Office day 1, costing as much or more than computer and Computer has died! Wil not open. I'm in terrible dire straits to close out business deal and pay all and cannot with all records on computer. Terribly unfair and sad. I've been ripped off and need a contact number so I can call to get hopefully get help ASAP. This is my first negative reply, i wish I didn't have you write.
It is not user friendly , it's also hard to download anything!
This is the worst new computer I've ever purchased. I gave it 2 stars because I guess I need to leave room at the bottom for a computer that doesn't even power up. When on the internet I literally type a sentence then watch as it slowly appears, letter by letter on my screen. If I reboot it goes away for a while. I reboot about 3 times a day.
I'm happy with it
Great deal at the time
Horrible, took 6 and a half hours for it to be ready to get started. Kept on updating for hours on end and makes noises. Horrible purchase, not worth getting at all.
The Ideapad 320 sells at "Big Box" stores for $199, and it does a good job at basic tasks such as taking notes in class, preparing Word documents, doing emails and watching Netflix. It does NOT have the power for games or video and photo editing.As with many Windows 10 computers in 2018, initial setup is a pain. It takes about 18 hours over a three day period to download and install an endless series of Windows 10 updates. Then, you must run the Lenovo software update program and install a new BIOS. And, finally, because of a Windows 10 "bug", you must disable the option to use a PIN code to sign into Windows because the PIN code sign in option locks the CPU at 100%, turning your computer into a paperweight. To fix the bug, you press F2 when start up begins. On the BIOS menu, go to the security page and press "disable" next to "Intel PTT" to turn off PIN code sign on. Restart the computer and sign in with your full Microsoft Windows password.Next, a Windows bug built-in to Microsoft Edge causes problems with long videos. Install the Chrome browser to watch Netflix and other videos.After setup is completed, the Ideapad 320 does a very good job for basic tasks. The non-glare screen is great for working on documents.
Noisy! Noisy! Noisy!!!! If you wanna buy it, make sure that you are ok with the noise. It becomes noisy after a few minutes working. Color is nice. I don't like the shape of this laptop, the corners are kinda sharp. It's not 1TB, I don't know but I just see about 929.9GB in total. Anyway, I ordered an ASUS laptop and this one is not as noisy as ASUS. I have no idea why they are noisy. Slow!! Definitely not recommend!
This laptop is so slooooooowwwww. Like words can't even describe how slow it is. For starters the description stated that it had a LED back light, and it didn't. When I first opened the laptop and plugged it up of course there was things that needed to be installed and updated. This took about 2 hours. I mean i have others computers and tablets in my home on the same Wi-Fi connection and all move fast but not this device. After everything was installed and updated, when opening the web browser that even loads slow. I purchased this laptop for school and also because I felt like it was a great price but I would rather spend an additional $200.00 on another laptop and know that I wouldn't have to worry about speed and an update every time I open my laptop. Battery life sucks too on this device. I mean I wouldn't even give my 8 yr old daughter this laptop. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY SAVE AND GET SOMETHING ELSE!
This computer is so slow it is not possible to actually use it. I don't know if it's defective or if this is just a really poor design, but either way, it's going back and I would not recommend buying it.
Very inexpensive laptop with lots of features. However, the CUP and 4GB of RAM is woefully inadequate to run Windows10. It bogs down with the installed Microsoft Edge browser and is slightly better with Chrome. Installation of any antivirus program further slows it down. Not recommended. Spend the extra money on an upgraded laptop.
This computer is super slow, which I guess wouldn't be so bad if the battery life lasted. I bought this computer 6 months ago because my other Lenovo was having to stay plugged in to use. Time for an upgrade! Well we don't use a computer at home often, just here and there for homework, projects or crafts. So in the last 6 months we've used it a handful of times, using it for the last 20 minutes it has already dropped 20% in battery life. 1% per minute!!! What a joke! Such a waste of money because we basically need to use it as a desktop, so that it can stay plugged in. Which is where our other computer is, after being 6 years old.
Bought this for wife. She loves it. Awesome laptop for money.
My 4 year old Lenovo laptop, which sounds like it is going to explode and likes to randomly shut itself off, is considerably faster than this laptop. Still trying to fix this issue while resisting the urge to throw it against a wall. Too lazy to return. At least it was cheap and is pretty purple.
I have had this computer for about a month now, it's great. It is a little slow as some other reviews have pointed out but it really isn't an issue. I play Stardew Valley on it with no problem and you absolutely cannot beat the storage for the price. It is sleek and light, and I am so grateful to have a laptop.
This is my SECOND IdeaPad since Dec. the first had broken keys and now this one, the day after I was elidgible for refund the screen broke. Now I have no laptop for work unless I want to buy another
I've been using this laptop now for a short time but so far it works well. I love the details. I'll write an updated review in the future.
I had to return this item, only because I really missed have the 'Touch-Screen' feature.It's a good buy for the money.
It's a beautiful machine but it's slow.
My 2010 laptop is faster than this model. So disappointed with the performance of this product. I never had a computer this slow. It's better to pay extra money for a better computer.
This computer stinks. Itâs slower than my 6 y/o Samsung, shuts down randomly and while I donât have a lot on it yet ( and may just get rid of it) my security/malware is picking up a lot of issues and itâs only 53% optimized?! Very disappointed- cheap but... câmon guys!
Excellent laptop!
Works fast and the screen are awesome
For its price point, it's one of the the best out there. Love this laptop. More than met my expectations. Primary use is for homework and surfing kids also play games and watch videos.
Touchpad starting freezing within a few weeks of having this laptop and by 2 months it stopped working completely...I regret buying it
So beautiful!!! Opened box folded out arm added builds and plugged it it!! It is stunning!!
Thanks , I love Lenovo !
It's great
it just stopped powering up not even a month old
Love it
loved my laptop, loved the color
Just bought a Lenovo since it's what I can afford at the moment but the battery life sucks it barely lost 3 hours. Not sure if my battery came defected. The performance speed is ok but again it's just something I'm settling for but still wish it had a higher performance rate.
Beautiful color. Large screen. Too big to fit in my laptop bag. The system is very slow starting up snd shutting down and that's with nothing really being stored on the computer. Would hate to see how slow it gets when things are downloaded on it. Returning this one.
After 2 months there is no access to the internet. To correct the software issue I was told I now have to pay $19 a month for a minimum of 10 months. I want my money back!
Not as good as a dell.
Got this as a giftwould not power up, had to charge 2hrs,Still setting up but its slow. Im thinking about, returning not a good first impression at all
Not a gaming laptop. but great laptop for school. Affordable and looks great!
SUMMARYThe E 15 is a fast computer with plenty of ports and great battery life, but the washed out screen holds it back.DESIGNWith a bevy of ports including VGA and a DVD drive, plus its heavy weight, the E 15 screams "work computer!" This isn't a bad thing, because it also feels substantial, including the monitor hinge. Many laptops in this price range feel like they need to be babied to survive long. There is a physical Ethernet port, an HDMI port, three USB 3.0 ports, and up to date 802.11ac WiFi. One nice touch is that the matte plastic has that brushed look, giving it a bit more traction and style. More importantly, and unlike many modern laptops, it is easy to service or upgrade.PERFORMANCEThe 8th gen Core i3 2.2 Ghz CPU and 6 GB memory combine to give swift performance for most common tasks like word processing, web browsing in many tabs, and streaming video. One shocking thing to me is how well it handled running its own 1080p screen, a second 1080p screen over USB 3.0, and a third 2560x1440 screen all at once without issue. I was running multiple HD video streams and web browsing at the time on different screens. My previous laptop that cost much more and had a dedicated GPU dropped a lot of frames in this configuration.I only notice the weaker CPU compared to my more expensive laptop with CPU intensive or heavy 3D tasks. If you are running those, including things like gaming beyond the basics or rendering video, this may not be the right choice. With that said, at this price, there is no great solution.I see another review talking about how slow the computer is, which makes me wonder if Windows was still installing updates. Any new computer is going to be slow while all that happens in the background. The network is being pushed, the hard drive is being run heavily, and the CPU is periodically busy. The only thing noticeably slow is startup. An SSD upgrade would speed things up substantially.SOFTWAREWhile I have to use Mac OS and Linux for work, Windows 10 is my favorite OS. It is flexible and easy to work with, with the most support for hardware and usually no headaches installing new devices. This version of Windows 10 is almost clean, but includes a few things that I would delete. Namely, Norton Antivirus, which can cause issues and slowdown. It is easy to delete and Windows 10 has an antivirus built in.DISPLAYIt is obvious where costs were cut to get the low price when you see the monitor in action. It has a large bezel, which is not such a big deal. However, the colors are washed out and even more washed out when not looking directly at it. It is one of the worst screens I have seen in a long time, and the main reason for dropping my score. It is passable, but I would personally spend a little more for a screen with better blacks and sharper details if I was going to do a lot of writing on it. While people rarely use laptops outside, the screen is also not bright enough for that. As someone who usually cranks down the brightness to save my eyes, that aspect is fine with me.If you are going to be docking it and using standalone monitors, it supports higher resolutions well.INTERFACEThere is no touch screen, which I surprisingly miss because touch controls are so good in Windows 10. But, they aren't critical. The keyboard has nice travel and a proper full layout. The trackpad isn't as responsive as a high end laptop and the clicks aren't as snappy, but it works properly and I haven't had to fight with it.BATTERYWow, the long battery life is so much better than my previous laptop, whichcould last through a movie and then be done for. This is likely due to the newest Intel CPUs being built for low power consumption in combination with Acer's lack of concern over a big heavy battery. The result is that, as long as I charge it at night, battery life just isn't a concern. There is even a charging port for phones or tablets that is functional with the laptop off, making this a replacement for USB batteries.The charging itself could be improved, with a relatively large power brick. I was hoping they allowed charging over USB, but I don't think that is available. I could be missing how to do it.EDIT: I forgot to mention the bright blue light that stays on when it is charging and shut down. It is very annoying to have it in my bedroom. A bit of electrical tape fixes it, but I wish it wasn't there to begin with.
This is a nice setup for under $400. The laptop features the Intel i3-8130U 8th generation (latest generation for 4/2018, a 2 core processor), a 1TB drive and 6gb RAM. The battery is supposed to last for 12 hours (I tested this a bit but not a lot). The laptop has 6gb, a read/write DVD drive, and a lot of connections and a 1920 x 1080 display.The laptop is responsive and snappy for an under $400 laptop. Iâm a bit perplexed by some of the reviews claiming this to be slow. It is not. This value laptop has some chops. I loaded my desired suite of applications with Ninite dot com, that went quickly. In testing performance, I ran a Netflix movie and a show on YouTube at the same time with no performance degradation. I ran the 2+ hour movie twice while doing other stuff on the laptop and the battery still showed over 7 hours left.This laptop has a lot of connectors: USB, HDMI, and even a VGA connection (which I would suggest dropping, if you need that just put a HDMI/VGA adapter in your computer bag). Also included is the R/W DVD drive... something becoming rare in laptops. A nice option to watch movies if desired.The laptop display is good but has a poor viewing angle. I wasnât surprised, my guess is that this is the display was where trade-offs were made to get the laptop to this price. The display is hard to see from the side (a witty salesperson would claim this is great for privacy) and required tilting the display forward/back more than I liked to obtain the best viewing angle from the front.The speakers surprised me. The speaker volume is typical to most laptops in that I wish it would be about 20% louder at max. The speakers seems to be nice but not amazing, at least until I was lying on a couch watching a movie with the laptop on my chest. The nearness of my ears to the speakers allowed me to hear a very nice spacial mix of the sound.. the movie sound track "bloomed" at that point and was surprisingly good. Bear in mind, I practically had to have the laptop a foot or two from my face for this to kick in.Overall, for sub $400, this is a very nice performing laptop.
Fantastic product. This laptop is a step up from the previous product which only had the skylake 6 series. The 8th gen processor handles some really impressive things for the price. The only thing is that pesky 5400rpm hard drive. Simply buy a 2.5â?ssd and a Sata to USB adapter. Plug the drive into the pc and use macrium reflect to copy the drive as soon as the computer is set up. Then pop out the old drive and insert the new ssd. It blows even my aging desktop out of the water. Even without a discreet card the graphics are impressive. It easily outputs 4K with less than 50% draw on integrated graphics. Although it might be limited for rendering and such. My biggest qualm is that the older model had a backlit keyboard that was great. I would have gladly paid 400 for this laptop if it only had that backlighting. As far as budget laptops go this acer is fantastic.
For its price, one of the best option out there. What concerns me are the cramped keyboard layout and sturdiness of its screen cover. It's keys are small and non-standard while the screen cover, a press will feel like a space between the cover & led screen.
My HP and DELL had a few bells and whistles that I miss on this ACER. Other than the aforementioned, for speed, functionality and price this laptop is excellent!
Best deal on the internet. It's a beautiful Computer, and so far, it works wonderfully. I love that it has a 12 hour battery. Great for where I live in Africa where the energy is not reliable. My daughter researched the net and bought one of these. When I say it, I bought one for myself even thought my 6-year-old Acer is still going well. Go for it!
Fantastic laptop! Runs most games i've thrown at it and it's easily upgradeable. I'm installing an SSD and running windows and apps off of it and using the included 1TB HDD as storage until i can get an SSD for storage as well. The battery life is excellent and it was almost entirely clear from the random crap most big box retailers slam into their off the shelf machines (removed the antivirus included as it doesn't hold a candle to avast).My major complaint thought is the trackpad. I really wish there were buttons on it instead of a click of the right or left side of the pad. I just can't get used to the tactile click vs having no button. I also have an issue with the power button essentially doing nothing. I wanted it to put the laptop to sleep but it doesn't do anything. Might be a software issue though.
Iâm not the most tech savvy person on earth. My old PC was starting to become unreliable, and I knew I needed to replace it before it died. I did a bit of comparison shopping on Amazon, and decided on this Acer. It has lots of space and is fast enough for me. I do not play games on this laptop, so I donât know anything about graphics, etc. I feel I got a great laptop for the price, and it suits my simple needs.
Love it. The best laptop I've bought to date, but cannot say that because of WIN 10. I'm familiar with WIN 7 and learned to hate WIN 10 after a few hours. UBUNTU 18.04 is now loaded and working well. I'm keeping my old WIN 7 laptop for things that I cannot do on UBUNTU, and that list is getting shorter.The FULL HD 1080 display is incredible.
Delivery time is just a week, for an i-Parcel order, its quite surprise.I got this notebook by $359, its a very nice price for a desktop replacement with latest i3 8th gen CPU, this CPU its performance even better than i5 7th gen CPU, also come with 6GB RAM and 1TB harddisk, good enough for browsing internet, watching online video streaming at home.Another pros is it come with a DVD drive, and many kinds of port, you don't have to connecting internet by adapter if your wifi is down, you don't have to connecting old monitor by VGA port adapter, if you need to install a software or watch DVD, you don't need to connect a external DVD drive. Also it is very easy to extend like add more RAM or even a M.2 SATA SSD drive.I guess it can run some simple game, I don't play computer game and I never expect Intel graphic chip can do much.The cons is it just have around 4GB RAM available after boot up, maybe its because of the bloatware such as Norton anti virus, I guess remove such softwares or reinstall a clear version Windows could help, also its display drive is not well installed, you have to reinstall it in Device Manager manually.I am happy for this deal.
Not the fastest PC around, but at this price you can't expect it to be. Otherwise works fine and not much bloatware.
It is fast and I don't think is slow as complain by some reviews, most probably after downloaded the antivirus software. The only disadvantage was the lack of drives, example the D drive already set for DVD and this should be a backup drive. The E drive also not there, lack of partition but overall this laptop can consider very fast. It great even though not a back-lit keyboard.
I love my new laptop. I love it so much I bought another one for the club I belong to.
Good laptop for the price! Comes with a little bit of bloatware, but I've seen much worse from other manufacturers. **** Important: HDD was 30% fragmented upon arrival; hence, it was running fairly sluggish at first. Run disk defragment to fix this (you can use Cortana to search defragment, but Acer also has its own utility).**** After taking off the little bit of bloatware it came with (including Norton) and running disk defragment, it has fairly quick speed/response and tons of free space. Could easily run something like Minecraft off this, but it's intended for leisure/everyday/school/office work; not gaming.Pros: Low Price, high HDD capacity, long battery life, 1080p screen, reasonable RAM (6GB), low heat 8th gen. i3, louder-than-typical speakersCons: Feels heavy, meh keys (non-backlit, thin, cheap), a little bloatware
Very pleased with the product quality. It was also delivered on time.
I really enjoy this computer. worth the cost, going to buy another one of these.
Very happy with the computer and the whole buying on Amazon experience. Thank you.
My old Acer wore out and I didn't question what I would replace it with.
Very slow, very disappointed. Should have done more research I guess. Thought 6 giga of ram would be faster but I guess it has a not so good processor?
Good product, nice. It's slow with the original software, I had to format it and install windows 8.1 and office 2013, that improved the speed.
The screen is fair. Not as good as what I expected. Otherwise a good computer for the average user.
Acer has stepped up its game. THis is a great laptop!
Great budget laptop, paired it with and m.2 ssd and works amazing
Everything works perfect,obviously after the (windows 10 services) tweak.. only noobs will complain. Great product..
Nice Size and works great so far !
Bought this for my 82 year old grandmother in-law and she absolutely loves it. Works like it should.
Bitterly disappointed with the performance of this laptop. Takes forever and a day to boot up. Opening up applications takes ages too and keyboard keys are muddled. Avoid this laptop. I will not purchase another Acer.
The description states this computer has a 1080p "full HD" monitor. However, I returned this computer within hours of delivery because the colors were very flat, contrast was poor and the monitor emitted way too much blue light. The monitor quality on this computer was unacceptable.
thank you
Sleep doesn't work under Windows because of a bug in the video driver. I was able to fix it by going to Intel's web site and getting the latest driver from there. It requires manual install because the automatic installer refuses to replace the manufacturer's (Acer's) version. But you can override that and then sleep works. Without updating the driver, you just won't have a sleep option on any menu. Also, in the hardware manager you'll see an error symbol indicating that the graphics card is having problems. All that gets fixed with the latest driver from Intel's web site. This is a windows only issue -- I also installed Linux and sleep worked fine out of the box (but installation requires some extra steps to work with UEFI secure boot).
This is the best laptop for light or a decent amount of gaming. It runs pretty quick for its price and most likely the best outcome for the money spent.
This Laptop Great!Low price!High productivity,if you want to make it stronger, inserd SSD
Good computer, fast, beautifull colors, perfect present for my daugther graduation

One of the best budget laptops in Acer
I love this computer.
Good laptop, very good Quality/proceso ratio.
Very good, works well, is fast
Not too bad. Poor quality screen, even for a TN panel. The main problem were the Trackpad Drivers were trashed. Have your paper clip ready to reset the computer. Acer was more worried about getting the warranty information than that their product didn't work. Don't expect it to work straight out of the box.
For the price, a very good computer. However I made the very small OS upgrade from Win10 Home Edition to Win10 Education Edition, and now the screen brightness keys do not work. Acer's tech support's only advice was to reset the computer to the original OS to fix the problem. So the low rating is for product support rather than the product itself. It should not be difficult for them to produce the necessary software patch.
The laptop arrived,The looks would probably get a 3/5. It's somewhere in the middle of a cheap laptop, with some accents found on more expensive models.But the built quality and design, is similar to $300-$500 laptops.Like mentioned, the viewing angles of this screen isn't the best, but if it's just for you, sitting in front, it's quite ok!I like how they re-assigned some of the Fn keys (vol and screen brightness) to the cursor keys, instead of your standard number or F-keys.The speakers sound very nice for a laptop of this kind.It comes with only 2 hours worth of uninstalling crapware, vs the 8 hours of prepping I'd do on most other laptops.Mostly just the crap that comes with Windows installation, Firefox, a trial for Norton AV or something, and some Acer specific software that really doesn't serve any purpose.The weakness of this device is definitely the slow harddrive, that results in a laggy device. Upgrade to an SSD ($60-120 more), and this device should work quite well!That, and the screen, which has poor viewing angles. However, if you're the only one using it, the screen looks quite good. It's definitely bright enough for indoor usage. The colors are ok. They say 'wide gamut', but because the blacks aren't really black, it looks more like a cheaper TFT screen.For the rest, I had no problems with wifi, browsing, gaming (does well up to 1080p).The RAM is supposedly upgradeable to either 8 or 32GB, but 6GB is really more than you need for day to day usage.For the price, it's a great device, that blows older professional laptops of 10x the price, out of the water (performance wise).It probably will serve me well for the 4 to 6 years of the lifetime of a laptop. (No reason to go with a more expensive Asus or Sony that will outlast this laptop for 4 years, when you only keep laptops 4 to 5 years max).My guess is, this laptop will outlive Windows 10, and that's a good thing!
Perhaps it's because I'm middle aged and slowing down myself but I don't understand how anyone can think this is a slow computer. It's not the fastest I've owned but an i3 priced in the $350 range isn't going to run with the $700 machines. I plan to use this one for data storage and access, not as my main machine. To that end, setting up a simple database and retrieving information, online data searches, e-mail, and blog posting (pictures, text -- running on Wordpress) has so far been a breeze and this E15 is more than fast enough, has plenty of storage, and a very good set of ports including VGA. The CD/DVD drive works perfectly and is a nice addition, as my other relatively new laptop did not include one. Windows 10 is pre-installed as are the usual bloatware, easily uninstalled. Speakers actually sound pretty good, though I'm a headphones guy and would never judge a laptop by its sound system.Battery life is exceptional, making this an ideal travel machine.Two issues. 1) This is not a genuinely dual channel setup. This is 4 GB + 2GB (a kind of 'flex' processing) and while this likely won't matter to many budget customers, as the speed will be plenty fast, I think claiming dual channel is a bit misleading. It is faster than a single channel of 6 GB. OK, I'm being a little picky. 2) The screen isn't the best. It looks a bit dull, frankly, kind of like the old TFT screens found on all those old Toshiba laptops from years ago. If you're trying to save money on a laptop but still need deep, clear, saturated color, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.For the price, this E 15 is a very competitive machine. It's fast enough and has enough storage, ports, a dedicated number pad, and a responsive enough touch pad that I'm finding it very easy to use. (Using two-fingered commands on the pad is especially good on this machine.) Were it to have backlit keys and a better screen, it would be a stellar laptop for all my needs and would likely make it to my office as my main machine. As it is, it's a great backup and would be the perfect student computer as long as graphics aren't terribly important. Heck, it even looks great.This is my first Acer but it likely won't be my last.
the laptop is absolutely cute, amazing performance, nice design, lovely Full HD screen and powerful processor, i can even play a heavy games.gr8 laptop, 10x to acer.
Really slow don't buy it.
Very slow, partially due to not having Windows configured at all. Waste of time 5400 HDD, don't even bother. Did not recognize GSkill DRAM of proper spec. DDR3L DRAM when the chipset and CPU clearly would support DDR4. BIOS is terrible and almost non-existent. Fitted with an NVMe m.2 socket but advised that only SATA is supported. Screen is marginally acceptable but bad. The viewing angle is so poor you can't even get a same-tint background all the way across the screen. I sent it back and won't be buying another ACER. Support material is TERRIBLE and printed in text so small you need a microscope. The 8th Gen i3 is adequate, but theentire system is lacking. Misc detail - The Mobo is a KBL Ironman_SK and the DRAM timing as delivered is 11-11-11-28. Perhaps Acer will fix this in the next iteration. Very glad I didn't spend more to get the i5 with the screen the way it is. ~~
Works well but it a little slow
I like it so much!
I don't think I'd buy this again. Last year I bought a refurbished Dell with an older i5 processor for half the price. I decided to buy this Acer for my wife instead of another refurbished Dell because of the claim about graphics. The graphics on the Acer are not very good. The resolution on my kindle fire HD is much better. But the 8th generation i3 processor is fast. The battery lasts forever. The startup is almost immediate. There is tons of storage space with 1 TB. The machine doesn't get hot. One more negative. The track pad is bad. The cursor doesn't go where I want it to.
The Acer Aspire E5-576-392H is a nice budget laptop with good performance and usability. It has some good hardware features such as the 8th Generation Intel CPU, Full HD 1080 LCD screen, USB3.1 Type-C, fast 802.11ac wifi with MU-MIMO technology (up to 3 times faster speeds on MU-MIMO networks), and relatively long battery life. It is certainly fast enough for general multitasking, casual gaming, and playing videos, but it is not a gaming laptop. Bootup time to the Windows login screen is about 14 secondsAcer ranks relatively high among laptop manufacturers. LaptopMag (part of Tomâs Guide) rates Acer as the fourth best laptop company in 2018 with a score of 81 (out of 100). The highest rated laptop companies are Lenovo (score of 86), HP (85), Dell (82). Tied with Acer is Asus (81). Lower rated companies are Microsoft (77), Apple (72), Razer (70), MSI (67), and Samsung (67). So Acer is not significantly lower than the higher rated laptop companies. LaptopMag states that Acer knows how to provide premium features at bargain-basement prices, giving great value and pleasing aesthetics. Acer got dinged slightly for its customer support.Hardware features:* CPU: Intel 8th Generation i3-8130U Processor 2.2GHz; Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz and 4 MB SmartCache. Codename Kaby Lake-U/Y. It has 2 cores and 4 threads.* Graphics: Intel UHD Graphics 620 integrated on the CPU* Motherboard: KBL Ironman_SK V1.32* Memory: 6 GB of dual channel DDR3L SDRAM 800MHz; Max is 16 GB; slot 1 has 4 GB and slot 2 has a 2 GB stick and are easily accessible.* Screen: 15.6 inch LED backlit, full HD 1920x1080 resolution. Not a touchscreen. Viewing angle is generally good, except that the black colors in photos and videos may appear as a gray washout when the angle is more than about 45 degrees from center or the screen is tilted backward or forward.* Hard drive: 1 TB Toshiba 5,400-rpm hard drive. (Remove the compartment cover and you can swap out the drive with an M.2 SSD (solid state drive) up to 512GB).* DVD: 8X DVD Double-Layer Drive RW (writer); M-DISC enabled* Ports: Left side: Ethernet (Gigabit LAN) (RJ-45), two USB 3.0 ports, and a compact USB-C 3.1 connector, HDMI out and VGA video output connectors.

I thought it was quite good.* Wi-fi: fast 802.11ac wireless with new MU-MIMO technology (up to 3 times faster on MU-MIMO networks). It also has Dual-Band wifi at 2.4GHz and 5GHz.* Bluetooth is included* Speakers: Stereo speakers with Acer TrueHarmony offering lifelike audio* Battery: 6-cell 2800 mAh Li-ion. While Acer states that battery life may be as long as 13.5 hours, I got about 6 hours using the default settings.* Warranty: 1 yearSoftware:* Windows 10 Home edition* Microsoft Office 365, 30 day trial* Norton Security (trial)* The usual Windows 10 suspects, such as Skype, Bubble Witch, Candy Crush, Disney Magic, March of Empires, MS Solitaire, etc.Whatâs in the box: The laptop, charger, Acer contact info, 4 page set-up guide (in English and other languages), and a few other documentsPerfomance:For a budget laptop, performance is very good. LaptopMag states 8th Gen Core chips are between 50 and 92 percent faster than their predecessors on multi-threaded tasks. Geekbench 4.2.3 gives my Acer a single core score of 3970 and a multi-core score of 7842. Geekbench uses an Intel Core i7-6600U (6th Generation Skylake architecture) for its benchmark and the single core baseline is a score of 4000. Geekbench 4.2.3 indicates the multi-core score for the i7-6600U is 6758. Higher numbers are better. So the Geekbench indicates that my Acerâs i3-8130U CPU is equivalent to the i7-6600U on a single core comparison, and faster than the i7 when both CPU cores are used.For the graphics, LaptopMag states the Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics processors are suitable for some entry-level casual gaming and multimedia, including Ultra High-Definition videos.To test the multitasking capabilities, I opened 25 tabs in Firefox. I began downloading a large file. I ran Wonderfox Video Converter to convert a video to a different format. And I played a DVD movie using 5KPlayer. While all this was running I went into MS Word and began typing. There was no lag or delay as I typed text, so running all of those processes did not degrade the performance.Other comments:*USB 3.1 Type-C port supports ultra-fast data transfers. USB 3.1 more than doubles the theoretical bandwidth of the USB 3.0. USB Type-C is a new, tiny, super-fast connector for the Universal Serial Bus standard. And the USB 3.0 ports can charge your devices when the laptop is powered off.* I think the dual band wifi is great. You have to use a wifi router that supports it to get the dual band benefit. On my Netgear AC1750 router, my destopâs download speed using an Ethernet cable is 235 Mbps (on Spectrum). The Acer gets about 40 Mbps download speeds using the regular wifi, but gets over 150 Mbps download speeds when connected using 5G wifi. Your mileage will vary.*Windows no longer includes software to play DVD movies, so you may want to consider a free video player like 5KPlayer or VLC Media PlayerIâve only had one small issue with this Acer laptop. Sometimes it does not find my desktop computer on the network. On the positive side, it survived a deep puncture hole 3 inches wide in the box during shipment. I would recommend this Acer Aspire E5 laptop.
The Acer Aspire E15 is designed for a specific audience. It is not a gaming computer. It is designed for someone who wants to go on the internet, surf the internet, stream some shows, and type some documents. This would be ideal for someone who is a student or someone who wants a travel computer just for consuming media (in fact, it as a DVD drive, which none of my other gaming laptops have!).The computer is relatively slow at most tasks, which is normal for a basic computer running an i3 processor. It takes a few seconds longer for most tasks, including turning it on, opening a web browser, or opening an app. However, everything works. If you do not expect lightning speed, then this computer works with no problems.The only real issue is that because the computer is already so slow, too many open applications make it nearly impossible to use. This is not necessarily the fault of the computer; it was built that way. It is the fault of the intrusive programs. Norton anti-virus is a very aggressive program, and when McAfee got installed during a Flash update, having two intrusive, aggressive anti-virus programs open at the same time made the computer chug so much, I thought it crashed. Once they were uninstalled, and other apps closed, the computer ran at a normal speed.If you are looking for a basic laptop such as this, then I recommend you cleanup programs you do not want, fine-tune the WiFi settings (I had to change mine because it kept losing connections to my router), and run the Windows updates. Once this is done, you will have a perfectly fine machine. Right now, it is a perfect computer for my son, who is learning to use the internet for research, play some web browser based games through his school, and listen to CDs through the DVD drive (this type of optical drive is slowly being phased out of laptops, so I am super impressed it has one). If this sounds like the kinds of things you want to do, then I recommend this computer.
Does,t have the same resolution (1920) as the 7th generation
Although I do 90% of my technology on my phone, I do have a few things that require a PC to do. Some things are just easier to type or do on a laptop than mobile device. I had previously got a Chromebook, but there are many programs and functions that I need that were not compatible. The main hurdle I have faced lately is using my husband's laptop to use my Cricut for new downloads and projects because my Chromebook would not run it. This worked great for SVG and font files and synced flawlessly with my Cricut. From the moment I opened the box, I was pleased to find a shiny new laptop. It was actually a little bigger than I was expecting at the price point, but I was glad to see the keyboard boasted a number pad which is lacking on many laptops. Once I opened it, plugged it in and turned it on, I was greeted by a Cortana, Microsoft's version of Siri. She walked me through the set up process and I was online within minutes. The TB hard drive is a nice asset for a computer in this price point. The screen was okay but not fabulous. If you are looking for a high powered gaming computer, you may be disappointed, but I found it very appropriate for all tasks that I need it for. I would definitely recommend it for as a solid find at this price point.
On time delivery. And I start to setup look nice and good price I recommend this laptop ððððð
Have had good success with Acer laptops in the past, and this adds to that reputation. Impressed with solid construction and speed/processing power considering the price. Recently bought a Lenovo laptop for similar money, and this is way better. Setup went quickly; very happy with the wireless, and appreciated the fact that it comes with DVD drive when many now do not. HD screen provides plenty of clarity. Very impressed with the long battery life as well.Windows 10 is a serious upgrade from the previous versions, and having it already installed on here made setup go much faster. Definitely not a high end laptop, but will get the job done for work or for a college student in a non-technical major, and appears much more durable and robust than some of the "sleeker" models on sale in stores next to it.
I received my Acer laptop and the first thing I liked about it was the ease in getting it up and running. Just turn it on and it sets itself up - just say yes or no to questions it asks you. And then there was a pleasant sjrprise. I have a three computer subscription to Microsoft Office 350 and the laptop did all the work. It didn't even ask me if I had Office, it just asked my Microsoft password and then installed the suite automatically. Considering the low price, the Acer is pretty fast and the image on the screen is crisp and clear. I would definitely recommend it.
This is a nice laptop in the price point. It will do anything the typical user needs it to do. It's good for just surfing the internet, playing and streaming videos and music, and even some games. The picture on the screen is very clear and looks fantastic. I really notice the full HD capabilities. The computer speed is good, doesn't run too slow. This is a nice family laptop and it stay in our living room for all family members to use when needed. You will need to put your own virus protection on it as the trial period ends after 30 days for the virus protection. Battery life also seems good with the battery not draining too quickly while doing tasks.
I can't say for sure whether the problem with this computer is due to it's design, or the configuration of Windows 10, or the installation of Office. But the bottom line is that this is a very slow computer that does not efficiently run Office. I have just tried to open a simple spreadsheet, only to have Excel slip into a "not responding" state... 5 times in a row!Access to the internet is slow, basic pages that pop onto my screen with my 5 year old Dell notebook take forever. Moreover, I have been working with this PC for 3 hours now and the alleged 12 hour battery shows 4 hours of time remaining (and the unit has been sitting for some of that time.Frankly, there are just too many performance inconsistencies with this PC for me to offer even a lukewarm recommendation.
For the cost of this laptop, you get a lot. I like the processing power, there is plenty of memory, and the storage is great. The screen has good brightness range. The plastic build is sturdy enough to last for a decent amount if taken care of properly.My biggest complaint is that you cannot remove the battery. Once the battery starts to go, you can't replace it. Unless you can take apart the entire laptop and replace the battery cells yourself, you would have to purchase another one.Not sure how universal this issue is but the speakers on mine are looow compared to other similar laptops from other manufacturers so be wary of that.
I should have returned this laptop. I had problems with it right out of the box, but needed it for work and rationalized it as just being annoying. Immediately, it began to have problems with lag and freezing of applications, mainly Word. It was pretty intermittent at first. But now, about one year later it's basically useless. It freezes, fails to start, and often crashes when logging in. When it does actually make it to the desktop, its borderline nonfunctional. It lags horrendously, and programs often fail to respond to the point that I have to hard shut down the computer because it crashes. I have been through every piece of troubleshooting I could find online with no improvement, and it is getting worse.I hope I'm the only one that has this problem, and I see here that many people are finding theirs works fine. Not so much on my end.
Two complaints about HP laptop PC, 17 inch, 2017 Edition:It is slooooooooooow: Slow to start up, VERRRRRRY Slow to just open Office Word documents, and WORSE to open simple web sites. That never happened with my old HP laptop PC that I used continuously for 10 years, since 2008. I am very disappointed. I would return it but I missed the 3 month window (no pun).Second Complaint: Before you know whether you have a problem with an HP laptop PC, the included short warranty RUNS OUT. Then without any warning, they want another $137 warranty -- not forever, but only for ONE YEAR! That means in 3 years, I could have paid for a whole new HP! No Way! I think they overcharge.
Does everything I wanted and more. Great product for the money. only regret is keyboard is not back lite.
The description for this computer reads: 2017 Edition HP 17.3 Inch HD+ (1600x900) SVA BrightView Premium High Performance WLED-Backlit Laptop, Intel Core i3-6100U 2.3GHz, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD, Win10This is not backlit, and that is a huge disappointment for me - I never would have purchased this computer had I known that it didn't have this feature. Everything else seems to be working fine, but this is very frustrating.
This laptop keeps no charge with its battery. Terribly disappointing. I thought I would give HP one more chance as I have several Lenovoâs that have had no issues. I truly regret this purchase. This was a Christmas gift..so sad
The major draw back is the short battery life, only about four hours between charges. Since I rarely use it outside my home this is not a deal breaker, however if you need a laptop that you use for extended periods away from an AC source I'd take heed.
Battery life is the worst
So far so good
I bought this as a cheap replacement for a previous tablet that I lost. I'll start by saying I use this primarily to watch movies on airplanes and to surf the net, so if you're looking for a review on how this handles intensive gaming, this isn't it.Right out of the box, this thing will need a Windows 10 update. Be prepared to give it AT LEAST 24 hours to go through the entire update. This isn't a fault of the device, but it's slightly annoying if you thought you could just fire this thing up and get started. Do yourself a favor and get started on it as soon as you take it out of the box, plug it in, and connect to the internet. It will save you time down the road when further Windows updates are released.The graphics on this little thing are pretty awesome. I stream Amazon Prime movies and the quality of playback was superb. A big plus for my usage is that it fits perfectly on an airplane seatback tray table and still leaves room for a drink, especially when you detach the keyboard and leave it in your bag (no need for it unless you're typing, but the screen can double for that purpose if you don't have a lot of typing to do). The keyboard itself is very sturdy and doesn't feel cheap at all and provides a nice, protective cover when attached and folded. The keys are very responsive and the integrated trackpad/mouse works as expected. No surprises.I added a Micro SD card with 64 GB to expand the storage and the pics I had we're crystal clear. In fact, the images were better and had more depth and contrast than when I view them on my 23' desktop. The front facing camera is about what you would expect for a device in this price range and the microphone picks up sound pretty well when you're speaking within 4 to 5 feet of the screen. I can Skype with my kids without much issue and I prefer using this for video chatting over using a phone because I can see their faces better on this bigger screen. If you're thinking of using this for business video conferencing, there are probably better quality options for you.The one downside of this (so far) is the sound produced by the device itself. The speaker is pretty awful if you try to listen to it straight from the device and can only be described as "tinny" and it is definitely monotone, not stereo. I connected my Bluetooth headphones to this device and the sound was good that way. If you're thinking you can lie around in bed and watch stuff with this, I would recommend headphones otherwise you'll miss out on a lot of background stuff due to the low fidelity of this thing.
Update: I returned this unit.I came back to make sure I only gave it a one star. The lines in the screen never went away after waking from sleep, pressing again would correct it but, next time it slept the line in the screen would take over the whole screen.I literally hate this keyboard. The first couple of times even holding the unit, the keyboard detached and landed on my foot; man that hurt.I cannot even hold, open, or barely use the unit with the keyboard as it falls off way too easy.Even when I use it the keyboard flops all around. Opening the unit will separate the keyboard from the tablet causing problems with usage.I would much rather have the 2017 version with a hard keyboard; much like a laptop.I may be raving on and on but, I really feel strongly about my dislike for the keyboard setup.The display did freak out when I awoke it from sleep; it had lines running through it and could not read display.I hate to return things but, this one might have to go if it keeps up.I haven't used it that much yet but, the unit appears to be slow to respond. I have often read about slow tablets and to me barely noticed but, this one...SLOW!I am not that impatient but, I will have three windows open from clicking the same thing; thinking that it did not open.
Is a crappy computer as soon as i got it, it had a screen that that said it needed to be repair, mailed the seller and they have not responded
Too many problems, I returned them(2).
Realtek Lan wireless doesn't work.."new" computer...piece of junk
Whole system crashed after only a couple weeks of having it.
Don't Buy This...it ant worth the money
No Wi-Fi capability unlike stated in product description
i bouth this similar item,,, a waste of time, i didn't even kept it for a week, i turned it off and when turn it back on, it has no windows installed! it was NULL! i look around and found that it didn't had the old windows version installed in case a back uo needed to be done, that's the reason it came back on with no windows! nothing, cero! i returned it as fast as i could!
Received it today, loaded Windows updates and downloaded Office. Will add comments if anything goes wrong, but for the money, you can't beat this machine. My old travel laptop finally died and I hate spending lots of money for a travel machine when all I need are the basics. I refuse to travel with a laptop that requires "the cloud" to function properly. I may pull the 4GB RAM and put in an 8GB card, but that's for later.Oh, and I noticed several people complained about the track pad. After downloading all the updates, I noticed one of them was for "track pad update." My pad seems to work as well as my other PC after the update.
This laptop is not for gamers or those that need powerful editing programs. It is a couple steps above a Chromebook,but a couple steps below the more expensive and powerful units. It is a great in between for those that need the basics but want more than a Chromebook.It provides a large amount of storage space-I ended up with around 420 after with Windows and other pre-installed programs already built in. There is also a slot for a SD card if you need/want more space.While DVD/CD drives are becoming a thing of the past, it is nice to have one built in this unit and I consider this a huge plus.If you travel a lot like me, you might want to go with a smaller screen as a 15 inch screen can be difficult to pack and carry along as you go.The only complaint I have(so far) is the quality of the track pad. It is not the best, so I recommend getting another mouse.
Had it almost a week now and I love it. Plenty of hard drive space, a disc drive and best part is that it's not a crappy chromebook. It's got everything I need and the price is right. I recommend this to anyone, especially if they live paycheck to paycheck.
This is a bottom of the line, VERY basic laptop. Expect that, and you won't be disappointed. The one thing that really irritates me is the fact that it was loaded with McAfee Anti-Virus software that was a demo. After a month, when it expired, I began receiving daily messages to purchase McAfee to protect my computer. Still getting 'em to this day. Ugh.The quality of the build is lackluster, but is on par with what you pay. Plastic, cheap, but efficient enough, if you are a casual home or office user. Not good for traveling.One of the best features of the laptop is the DVD drive. It's cheap and flimsy, so you need to be delicate with it, but it's a GREAT option.
I bought this laptop at the beginning of 2018. It's a cheap, yet decent for the price, refurbished laptop. However, after I unboxed it, I found they hadn't set it for OOBE (Out Of Box Experience), which is how most computers are initially set, so you can customize some of the settings and create your user account. And, certain things didn't work, like the Start/Windows button. It was somewhat unusable in that state, so I did a complete reinstall of Windows. (Thankfully, I'm a computer tech by trade, and have already done this stuff plenty of times before.) Also, upgraded the memory from 4 to 8 GB. Not terrible to get apart and not too many screws to worry about. You pretty much just pry the plastic shell from the bottom to get to the electronics. Also, as a side note, the refurbisher slipped in a single half-sheet of paper explaining what was included with the laptop. Fine, but the part where they wrote that Microsoft Works, not Office, was the current productivity software was a bit of a head scratcher. Works had been discontinued in 2009. Not trying to be harsh, but I'm not sure what happened there. Despite that, the laptop looked and operated fine. But, if I weren't a tech, I can imagine the frustration I'd be going through.
hardware is OK but the software preload is disastrous. Disabling all HP services and removing everything called McAfee helps... Having 2 AVs running in parallel (the MS one and McAfee on top) kills about 1/3 of the performance without even doing anything...
I wish I would have read other reviews before I bought this. Others are saying they had problems within a week or two. Mine was defective right out of the box! I just got through set up when it froze and wouldn't do anything. It said sign in was bad. I was trying to replace my old laptop so I don't have to deal with stuff like this. Shipping back asap! What a waste of my time
Within a week of arriving it had a small problem after an update installed. Contacted HP customer service who said (to my shock) that it was "No longer under the 90 day software warranty." They wouldn't help me even though they knew I had just purchased it as "new". Told me a LOT about what I could expect from them in the future, so I sent it back, and will NEVER buy HP products again.
This was a real disappointment. The build uses cheap parts. I found out after many hours of trying that one of the USB ports does not fully function. So, some devices work but others don't. Took a long time to figure out, so it is out of warranty. It is not the peripherals, because they work fine on other machines. This is just very cheaply built.
Had it for a few days now and, personally, I think itâs the perfect computer for what I need it to do. However it is slower than what I am used to and Iâm sure I can get it to go a little faster with a bit of geeky help. Response rate of course is pretty slow too. Perhaps theyâll make this a clearance item soon for future buyers or at least take it off the market and fix the speed of the PC. Time will tell.
This is perfect for what I needed it for and the price was definitely within my budget. It has enough memory for my movies and the screen is a great size.
It's only been a few months and already there is a big dead pixel area.
No, buy something faster. Wish I'd returned it before the opportunity passed me by
Unless you are pretty computer savvy I would stay away from this laptop. I honestly don't understand why HP would allow so much bloatware to be put on their machine to the point where it's virtually unusable. I've been trying to avoid a complete reinstall of the operating system, but I fear that may be the only option. Maybe today it's impossible to buy a Windows machine that isn't laden with bloatware.
Bought this with my Grandsons in mind who love their video games..I put this in the spare room on a stand and they have their private time to play games when they come to visit Great investment..
Arrived quickly as promised, otherwise it's so S L O W! I just use it for email, wordprocessing, and surfing the internet. When I attempt to move the curser/mouse pointer it slides all over the place, always missing the target. I have to wait for it to stop sliding about and then redirect it to its destination, sometimes need to do it 3 or 4 times. And opening documents or web links is also extremely slow. Not really worth the one star needed to post a review. Just downloaded latest Microsoft 10 update which made a slight improvement.
I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews. Word of mouth is sometimes the best way to review a product vs. learning the hard way. I've only had this laptop for a few months and we're already considering purchasing another computer. It is slow. And we're already getting warnings about the coolant (fan system) malfunctioning!
In general like the speed as compared to my 10 year old Lenovo. But the cursor movement on this HP freezes in place often, just won't follow my finger for several seconds. I haven't had time to shop for an external mouse; I hope that will overcome the problem.
The worse part of this computer is that a user cannot tell when the numbers lock is ON/OFF. It is a slow computer and it was necessary to upgrade to 8GB from the built-in 4GB. That cost another $100.
This laptop is not worth the discounted price. It runs slowly and the cursor sticks and then jumps. I will return.
They shipped it fast and I love the the look and feel and the separate 10 key. However, this laptop is really slow. I don't use it for games, just searching the internet and record keeping. It is slower than the laptop I replaced which was about 4 or 5 years old.
a little slow but not so much to discourage me from buying again. functions quite well
nice laptop for the price. Good bargain price device. Everything worked fine out of the box. Nice graphic processor. Could use a backlit keyboard, but thats my only real complaint for the price.
This was given as a Christmas gift and the recipient was thrilled. She loves this notebook and it all she wants and more. Good value.
Bought it for a friend. Work great for web browsing and media consumption.
Just Horrible! Immediately after I got this laptop, I would turn it on and it would turn off unexpectedly. Here's a fact: all of amazon's laptops are shifty. Uh, wrong word spell check two t's & no f! I did not want the hassle of returning another shifty laptop. Not realizing this shifty laptop would get even worse! Warranty quickly went out and I'm stuck with this piece of shut!
Awful, cheap laptop. Entire setup is plastic and reeks of 'Made In China'. WI-FI adaptor could not find my router (3 feet away!) and the whole rig was SLOW. Sad thing is, I did my research. A LOT of misleading info on this until. Skip it.
I wish there was more than 5 stars because thats how much awesome this laptop is. As beautiful it is, it also surprisingly for the price runs smoothly and fast. Great laptop !!!
Nice laptop for cheap. First boot it crashed but it restarted fine after that and the OOBE was a snap. I love the fact it comes with a DVD RW drive. Product description said it comes with a single RAM slot but according to Windows it comes with two RAM Slots with one slot in use.
This laptop is working great! Works wonderfully for what I need it for: schoolwork.
At the time price was great. Giving the benefit of the doubt and time since last purchasing a HP, thought they would improve.In my sincere and honest opinion, still not satisfied. Poor performance.Keep in mind, this is my and only not opinion.One must judge for themselves.
This is literally the slowest laptop Iâve ever owned. It takes forever just to open any pages and do schoolwork. I just needed it for school and it runs slower than the laptop I bought 7 years ago. So disappointed. Shouldâve spent a little more and bought something nicer.
After 3 days of minimal use, basically the setup, it died. I am guessing the HD broke down.
Lightweight for the size. Good value for the money. It was a replacement for an older hp.
Kinda slow but very nice computer for the price.
Works well for everyday home chores. Screen is crisp, bright and as good as many that are more expensive
good laptop for the price but the mouse buttons built in are kinda difficult to use. I advice getting a mouse.
Using it to replace a tablet that was a pain. Omitted the need to pay an additional cell phone charge to us it.
Itâs a powerful machine, I think itâs my home network that tends to drop the program from time to time?
I HAD A SIMILAR HP LAPTOP THAT i LOVED. IT TOOK MY SON 3 HOURS TALKING WITH HP TO ALLOW ME TO GET IN WITH THE PASSWORD I ENTERED. SOMETIMES IT STILL TAKES ME SEVERAL TRIES TO SIGN IN. I STILL CAN'T GET INTO SOME THINGS AND IT IS SO SLOW. I WAS DISAPPOINTED.
Not a fast processor. Not good for graphics & large spreadsheets, etc.
its okay......hate windows 10...always had windows 7....this computer which i didn;t know doesn't come with outlook 16...so you have to pay for it yearly....thanks microsoft...
As advertised, works great and delivered ontime
Extremely slow. Every day wants to update - which can take 20 minutes. Humming sound comes on sometimes. I may send back. Not worth the price that is for sure.
Great for the price and for what I need to work on. As a current college student I need something that is durable, reliable and cheap and sometimes that is hard to find. The pros: bright screen, dvd player, battery locks( never seen it before), doesn't freeze. Cons no back light for keys, low volume but other than that it was great
Too slow, freezes definitely not a high end machine nor was I expecting it to be but I certainly expected something better for its price turned out worst than my Granddaughters 9 year old Laptop (Toshiba), sent it back got a higher priced unit ($18 bucks) now my Wife is happy which makes me even happierð plays her games and streams her movies with no problems.
I love this notebook laptop. Great price, functions great.
wifes compute and she is happy need I say more
really nice purchase. I recommend this seller. I'll buy again soon.
Mama is using it so it has to be ok.
Works great!!! Love this computer.
Good price all I need in a laptop
this was for someone else
nice laptop
Nice laptop. Really love it
Our ten year old son loves this
Love, love, love my new HP Noebook laptop, such an excellent buy!!! The price was amazing, Windows 10, impressed!!!! I'd highly recommend....
Great priced for what it is.
I do not care for Windows 10
It's not as fast as I thought it would be, but it's sufficient for me.
Crap. Just... pure crap. Played one dvd and just stopped working period. Slow right off the get go. Takes 10 minuets to start up and then lags.. wish I could give it 0 stars.
Great computer for the price! Exactly what I expected Fast, reliable and easy to set up. I wish they offered the one year office product with it.
Extremely slow computer. Could not even handle Google Chrome and a couple work documents open at the same time
All GoodHappy daysDid have U.S plug on but easy fixed
Nice size screen and the keyboard layout is good but way slow.
It is OK, not good and not bad until now. I have experienced some issues with the speaker but I think it is probrably the RAM
I use this computer for our small business and so far it's working well. At times it's a little slow but really nothing to complain about. Definitely worth the money.
Not bad build is meh and color is ok but for the price is decent very loud though
My daughter loves her new HP Notebook. Totally excited about it.
My daughter seem to like it a lot.
Poor!! 32gb storage space??? Really???
Great product!
I love it!!the screen is big.. it has WiFi and Bluetooth It arrived on time and it was everything I needed.. although I will be only using it for school I love it
The computer would not turn on, sent it back the next day.
Christmas present however I opened it and this is perfect for my granddaughter who really only does work processing or google searches. Great buy and price.
I love this laptop! Itâs the one I was looking for in my whole life. I had my dadâs laptop for 12 years and I wanted a laptop on my own. That way I can do games and work at the same time
DEFECTIVE - Track Pad doesn't work, the hard drive is giving error messages and won't respond to updates. Very disappointed, it's the one gift my child really wanted this christmas and it's defective, AND I have to pay to ship it back to get a refund....
Computer is extremely slow and doesnât seem to have the processing power it needs.... extremely disappointed.
Arrived on time an actually early. New as described an works abs and runs great. LOVE LOVE LOVE my laptop!
I have always punched H P. Have never been disappointed.
I've had this laptop for 4 months now and have had no problems except when my husband messes with it. Great laptop for the price.
This computer froze and did not want to open any applications. I tried restarting it, letting it die out, logging off and nothing works. It doesnât let m do anything. Very bad.
Great computer for the price!
great work computer
It's a good note book. I was disappointed in that the Microsoft word and Excel is temporary with the tablet. They will ask me to but the software I am sure.
it works fine My only problem it seems to be slower than hoped
This unit lives up to all of my expectations and I am writing this review with it.
works very well
Laptop is great
Didn't work, returned for refund
Super slow,the screen is terrible like it has a white hue to it,lacks color, cannot connect to wifi, runs soooo slowwwwww, pages loaded up real slow too this was a waste of money. Huge regret picture made it seem like it was going to have a decent hd screen but no false ads. Avoid at all costs. I honestly wanted this to be a good value but its so defective beyond use 90s pc slow...
It's very good and user friendly. It is fast. I have not encountered any kind of problem so far and I hope it stays that way.
I purchased this Notebook for my granddaughter going off to college. She loved it!
Bought this yesterday! Already does not work! Staring at a black screen for 20 minutes while it is thinking. I am SOOOOOO pissed!
Better half loves it, she happy me happy!!!!!
Just what the doctor ordered.
No. It was a Christmas gift and the laptop didn't work due to software issues. We had to send it back. Huge disappointment.
Love the hp notebook laptop. Haven't had any problems.
Really like my Notebook. Right size to read my newspapers, and surf the web. Great color display. .
As good as its spec.
Worked fine for a couple months then hard drive failed after 3 months.
Great computer!
Windows 10 is simply terrible. The computer itself may be OK but the constant annoyances from Win 10 make this a regrettable purchase. My local geeks have worked with me to make the display as Windows Seven-ish as possible but that is only SOME help. MS has gotten way too intrusive into my personal decisions as the user. It refused to let me use my password of choice because it was 'seen too often.' Also the MS Edge software continues to intrude itself despite my having made the tried and true MS Explorer my browser of choice. Finally, no matter what I do, the computer continues to use Bing as the search engine despite me having changed the setting to use Google. In all probability, I am taking the machine back to my techs next week and having it erased and Windows 7 installed.
Very satisfied with my purchase. Excellent service and delivered as promised.
I likes th prompt delivery service. Plus it was exaxtly as advertised.
This laptop literally booted up then told me to restart it then bam, black screen
Surprisingly good for the money!This unit, the (HP Notebook Laptop 15.6 HD Vibrant Display Quad Core AMD E2-7110 CPU 1.8GHz 4GB RAM 500GB HDD DVD Windows 10) is a great starter for any home, student or office. Sporting Windows 10 is a great addon considering other computer offerings down in this price range which offer windows 7 if anything at all.As is, it's good for most tasks including some photo editing and processing. Handles the web and email with ease, simultaneously I might add. Will even run all that while working in Word and using rather large spreadsheets in excel!This unit is versatile and with a few cheap upgrades, will perform exactly like a $1,000.00 laptop.I'd recommend upgrading the ram to 8GB and the hard drive with a small SSD hard drive for speed, or a large fast 7200 rpm notebook drive. Once those are done, you've got something more than capable for almost anything you'd want to do with it.HP as always, great service and support along with great quality that will last you easily 4-6 years if you take care of it. Highly Recommend!
Excellent for the miney
I bought this as a gift for my grandson. He said he likes the hp and its fast.
It seems to work fine. For the money it is good.
HOLY CRAP THIS SUCKS! Do not waste your money on this POS. It's so slow, I couldn't do anything. Trust me. this is way too good to be true. Look somewhere else!
That it is new! Least favorite thing is it is a little bit slow
Awful present for my wife. Ruined Christmas. Would not powerup up after third time.
A great laptop for a great price
I love it
so far so good
Love it
Very nice but at times slow
It quit turning on ppl
Only 8 weeks old but already defective. Too cheap to be true.
WiFi adapter failed after 3 uses. Called HP and after an hour of useless back and forth decided to return the laptop. Not worth the time and effort.
expected a new laptop. it was listed as a new lap top. instead I got one that someone had ordered used and decided not to keep. It has a load of apps they installed on it that I can not uninstall. it has a bunch of documents that are not mine. And worst of all it will not read a CD or DVD. If at all possible i would give it no stars. As to the lap top it self it's slow , jerky and I hate windows 10. it is the most user unfriendly operating system out there. It is worthless.
Crap. Used it maybe twice and now it won't even boot up. Highly disappointed and frustrated.
This computer is slow. It's the exact same capacity as the last time I bought the low-end model for HP, and that was like 4 years ago. No improvement at all. Windows 10 does not work well on it because it is the slowest computer I've ever had. Very disappointed.
Nice basic computer for routine work which is what we wanted. It is not a high speed machine but it is satisfactory for our use. While it is stated as HP computer when you turn it on the "ASUS" logo comes up up every time.
Purchased to up-date older lap-top with Windows XP. It appears that to get Office 16 there will be a monthly/or yearly subscription charge.I have not progressed beyond turning it on for the introduction, then off and back into the box for the present to "cogitate."
Nice heavy laptop. Good color and speed. Not a big fan of Windows 10 but it's ok. Laptop locks up sometimes and I have to set it aside and let it cycle through whatever stalled it. Overall it's a good laptop that's built well and stays cool.
I purchased this laptop for mother and for the price, I was not expecting a lot, but this laptop failed to meet even my modest to low expectations. It is unusably slow. It takes like 5 minutes to boot up and every operation took an excessive amount of time to complete. It also fails to find and connect to her WIFI, continuously getting stuck on "Checking network requirements." We tried it out for a couple weeks but I'm returning it and trying a different brand. Awful product.
Product arrived functioning poorly, did not appear new. Desktop background was pixellated and number keypad didn't function. Sending back - will not buy again.
Got this for my boyfriend for christmas. We opened it early and it looks and sounds amazing. It works perfectly. Has tons of space which is what he needed. It really does have HD visuals. Would buy again without a second thought.
I don't know ð¤·ââï¸?because it was purchased for a woman friend who lives in hawaii and she says she didn't like it or want it, thought it was cheap or junk. I have 7 HP laptops and other than 1 Dell laptop. HP Computer ð» laptops are the only brand I buy. Quality products for printers or laptop computers. I will always buy HP made products!!
Todo en orden
Came in quickly the price is awesome, giving it to my husband for Christmas
Good product
I have had for less than a year. Keyboard does not work. Amazon will not refund. HP wants me to pay $25 shipping each way to fix it even though it's under warranty. Don't buy it!
So I just received my laptop yesterday for school and the box was a little damaged nothing major because the computer is wrapped excellently. Now however when I turned it on, it came straight on and Iâm reading the setup instructions and Iâm clicking the startup flag in the bottom left hand corner. Still nothing is working, so I googled and still couldnât find anything. So I figured force restarting solves most problems so I force restarted the computer and it came back on then the initial setup that shouldâve came on screen the first time appeared. Itâs a very good computer so far with easy setup especially if youâve previously had an Microsoft account to just log into. Seeing as i just received this package last night Iâll spend a week and a half testing it out and Iâll post an update.***UPDATE.So the speakers crackle. Not only when th volume is loud but low as well. And even though the laptop is new, a new update pops up on my screen everyday sometimes more than one and more than twice a day. Holds a great charge as well. Colors are very vibrant and itâs good at connecting with your phone and syncing data that you need if you arenât near your phone. Havenât tried this computer out with my Photography software yet but hopefully it wonât let me down!!
I actually really like this laptop. I purchased it because of its low price and seemingly good content and storage. I also use it for online college. It took a minute to really work faster after the big updates were installed but I expected that. I actually have it in my lap right now and it doesn't over heat! My past laptops would burn my lap after a few minutes of being on them, but I can have plenty of tabs and apps open at once on this computer and it won't heat up. I highly recommend this for a college student of any sort or someone who just wants something simple and not too complicated!
Boot up: go make a cup of coffee or take a shower. It might be ready when you get back.Launch anything: browser? give it a few minutes. Switch apps? Good luck.Popups: all the bloated software that comes pre-installed, and immediately expires, will keep bugging you even after you politely decline to renew subscriptions you never wanted in the first place.
The display is not as good as expected.
This was a gift. Item wonât work. My daughter received this for her bday and although my internet is fine in everything else in my house, it says Iâm connected but wonât allow me to do anything!!!!!!!! Not happy!!!!!!
Never bought it, but it's categorized as "dedicated" for graphics when it purports to have a Radeon R2 chip, which is integrated. Epic failure.
best laptop for this price.It's under $ 300.So about 5 years out of date,but still a good computer.
good laptop with 4gb ram and 500 gb hd
So, first thing is first: I am not a heavy PC gamer. I play mostly consoles when I do game. But I needed a new laptop for school and music production and it's rare to find a laptop with an actual graphics card higher than a 960M for this price.A few points:This DID come with 8GB DDR4 RAM, a 4GB GTX 1050 (not the Ti edition), and a 1TB hard drive. It does support up to 32GB RAM using 2 16GB sticks, and is upgradeable through a door on the bottom.Pros:-This laptop feels sturdy and solid. I love the red accents and the solid black main body color.-The graphics card has handled the light gaming I've done with it with flying colors. So far, I've tested Portal 2 at maxed out settings and it's done roughly 180-200fps. LA Noire at all maxed settings keeps a steady 30fps (it's frame locked), Metro 2033 at maxed settings runs at roughly 45fps.-The Intel i5 has been a solid CPU for it as well.-The wifi uses ac and b/g/n so it makes full usage of the 5ghz channel for wireless. The speed difference is night and day. I get almost triple the download speed using ac over b/g/n.-Battery life unplugged and surfing the internet is really good. 7-8 hours.Cons:-Ok, so this is my major issue and the only reason it's not getting 5 stars. The speakers are...not great. They advertise a subwoofer, but I'm not sure what the deal with that is since the bass on this is average at best. The speakers do tend to crackle and distort at higher volumes to the point where a musician like myself gets very annoyed. I'm actually debating on buying a bluetooth speaker to use instead.Overall, if you're looking for a solid gaming laptop, this is probably the best one I've found, but be aware that the speakers are not great and I almost feel like they dropped sound quality to increase graphics quality. It's a weird trade.
Where I can start, this has been my best laptop, the first days were a struggle, deleting the bloatware, updating drivers, downloading programs, passing file from my old laptop, the laptop was laggy sometimes, the laptop took a lot of time turning off and starting and I started to complain about my purchase, I had problems updating the Video Card, I didn't have administrator permissions, but those were little issues that I solved, then, updating all the things, drivers, setting the system for the best performance and following the instructions of others user, my laptop turned into a monster.It runs all the games that I want (Rainbow Six with all the settings full, GTA V in very high, PUBG in ultra settings,, etc) with 60+ fps and it's amazing. It doesn't overheat and now it starts really fast and it works great.I bought it for school, but I wanted something that could run some "heavy" games and this was more than I was expecting. This is my first "gaming" laptop and I'm really happy with my purchase. Now I'll get a SSD and more RAM and it will be the perfect laptop for this price.[TIP]If your graphic card appears as Intel HD Graphics use this this tip to change it to GTX's card. (Thanks to -BigDaddy- for the help)1. Right Click on your desktop.2. Click NVIDIA Control Panel.3. Click Manage 3D Settings on the left menu.4. Click on the Preferred graphics processor drop down menu under the Global Settings tab.5. Select High-performance NVIDIA processor from the list.
Nice computer. Fast boot. Great graphics. Loaded Fallout 4, Lightroom and Photoshop. All performed flawlessly. BTW, the screen looks fine, after reading the reviews about people swapping out the monitor, I was expecting garbage. It really look good, and I edit photos for a living. It's not pro, and you do have to tilt it to the right angle, but it's nothing to worry about. Certainly would not even consider swapping it out. BTW, it does look awesome connected to my 32" Samsung. Fallout 4 on the 32' looked great with this laptop. One tip, when you connect a second monitor via HTML, you will have to reselect the sound source, it defaulted to the HTML, even if it had no speakers.Also, after I did all the software updates, I was surprised to see the video source defaulted to the Intel onboard graphics, which will slow the system down. I had to go into the Nvidia settings and select the Nvidia graphics as the default for global settings. I thought that strange and might not have noticed if I hadn't run a benchmark and was surprised at how slow the graphics were until I changed the default.The BIOS settings are really dumbed down, not much to do there.The build is good, seems sturdy. It is not a light weight computer, but as a desktop replacement, I did not think it would be. Keyboard is good, and looks sharp with the red backlighting.Overall, very pleased, so far. I almost marked it down for having to fiddle with the Sound and video settings, and the consumerish BIOS, but it doesn't really detract from what seems to be a fine computer for the price. Highly recommended. It really is amazing the amount of computing power we can carry around in a small package for not much money.
Very good budget gaming laptop. Took out the 1TB HDD it came with, and threw in a 128GB SSD (which I just prefer speed over storage) and had an extra 8GB of DDR4 Laptop RAM so mine is a slight upgrade from normal, but that being said for the money it's a great portable gaming machine, obviously not as good as a desktop for around the same price, but pretty damn close. I get like 80s in PUBG, 150 in CSGO, and I didn't really bench more than that because I have my main gaming desktop for that, this is just for on the go. Overall it's good, monitor sucks, but that's what you have an HDMI port for, keyboard sucks, but most laptops have an awful keyboard in my opinion, and touchpad sucks, but nobody is going to use the touchpad for gaming. All in all I love it.
First things first: only get this if you don't mind having an absolutely awful screen. This is not a laptop for artists, with its washed out TN panel and poor angles. However, I'm not an artist, so this is a neutral point in my book. 1080p is good enough.Next, this thing's hard drive is abysmal and often causes the system to grind to a halt. However, this doesn't actually matter all that much if you know a thing or two about laptops, from which my next point follows.If you just want a laptop that works well right out of the box then maybe consider something else because you are NOT going to find something in this price range that matches that description. However, one of it's downsides: the thickness, is a blessing in disguise. Literally every issue I have with it can be upgraded away. Hard drive too slow? Install an SSD. Screen too awful? Replace it with an IPS touch panel. Not enough RAM? Add more! You can buy this laptop as a base to upgrade into a very capable machine.This thing is so cheap for the amount of power behind it, I genuinely can't think of a better system at this price point for running games. The fact that it has a GPU means that it will be capable for years. Right now you can play most games comfortably on medium settings and sometimes higher at 1080p 60fps which is more than I can say for game consoles. This thing just annihilates Minecraft and Wii emulation. It's great for making videogame grade 3D models in blender, and I've never experienced slow down in Unity. Photoshop and Adobe Premiere work fine, however the screen means you shouldn't really get this laptop if your primary concern is color accuracy.
Out of the box this is a very clean looking computer. It took a couple days to get all the updates done but that is to be expected. Once that was out of the way though and I did a disk clean up this thing runs like a champ. There was not a lot of bloat ware to get off of it either.My step son is very happy for this runs World of Warcraft at max settings and Battlefield 1 at near max settings (and yes it will run Crysis - hahaha)Can get a lil warm but that is nothing that a decent cooling plate cant fix. The screen is nice and bright, very fast refresh, keyboard is decent. Speakers are loud - not the best quality but it is a lap top / if you want louder just plug in your creative labs 7.1 surround sound into it.Over all this is a monster machine - especially for the price.Also, you could not build a desk top for this price with the same specs - I tried120 board200 chip185 video90 ram50 hard drive50 power supply50 case90 monitor30 keyboard25 speakers/headphones= 890
NEW REVIEW:I got one of these and it blew out on me in about 3 weeks. No idea why. Despite the comment below, I had it on a laptop cooler and I wasn't doing anything that would generate heat when it blew out. Research revealed that this was not a common problem with these machines, so I'm guessing I got one that just had something go wrong with it (not the first time that's ever happened to me).I sent it back to Amazon, got a refund and then bought another one. So far so good. I liked the laptop enough to warrant purchasing another one, so I thought it only fair that I revise my rating. Providing this one doesn't blow out on me in a couple of weeks, I see no reason not to rate it 5-stars (original rating had been 3-stars).It's an amazing little machine that runs everything I throw at it.OLD REVIEW:A great laptop, but it stopped working completely after about three and a half weeks of use. It shut down while I was doing light work (nothing that would generate any major heat) and then never came on again. Had it kept working, I would have probably thought it was the best laptop I ever owned, but given that it gave out on me after such a short time, I'm not sure I can recommend it. I'm giving it three stars because when it did work, it worked great. I was able to play "The Witcher 3" on ultra video settings with a very good frame rate (even though I usually knocked it down to high).There's no guarantee that my experience will be the same as yours though. No idea why mine stopped working. Good luck with your purchase. I had to return mine.
Ok, for anyone buying this laptop, I have to say that this is a great budget laptop. For 800 bucks it runs almost every game you'd want to play on high quality and 60fps (games that aren't extremely graphics intensive). BUT, a lot of people complain that the computer is slow (and so did I at first). It turns out that you just need to disable a lot of the startup bloatware and useless Microsoft services. Once you do, it'll run a lot faster. Just make sure that you have it plugged in to charge when gaming or else you'll experience frame drops and quality decrease. Other than the initial problems, this laptop is great!
I bought this laptop (1TB,8 RAM,I5 ) a few weeks ago,shipped really fast!,when I got this laptop I encountered a problem on the disk hard drive, it was always about 100%, I spoke with Dell's customer service and their employee gave an excellent attitude and fixed the problem in a few seconds, the next problem I encountered was limitation of the fps when the computer is unplugged from power source, to solve this problem you need to download the Nvidia GeForce Experience and change the battrey boost to 60 fps,great laptop so far,can handle most of the games on ultra,also look cool and comfortable to use,I keep updating if anything new come out.
I recommend doing a full reset using the "Fresh Start" option on Windows 10 after you get the laptop, which is not simply a reset, but puts Windows 10 to its default mode without everything Dell put on the laptop. The laptop is great, but when you first get it, it might run pretty trashy due to bloatware. After my reset, the thing has been running great for the last few months, but before the reset (the first week of owning the laptop), it ran slow, had low performance on games, and was simply not working great. That was my experience.
I like this laptop. upgraded from a dell i3531 which is a $250 laptop so its a huge step up for me though It still a plastic laptop so you probably should expect small cracks on the side of the laptop that doesn't effect the usability and isn't noticeable. to help avoid this recommend getting a poly carbonate shell to give you laptop more protection. I like that the laptop has a full HD panel but the TN display make colors look much worse when compared to IPS but its overall is fine if you never used an IPS screen (the difference is considerable). Sound is good and the underside sub woofer makes listening to music a lot more immersive. 3 USB 3.0 ports isn't enough for me i need at least 4 since one port is always occupied with a wireless mouse receiver i also need a port to charge my mouse and a port for a external HDD which means i always need to unplug one of these things if want to use another USB. The HDD version i have is way too slow for 2018 standards and i think SSD's are close to becoming the standard for laptops. Keyboard and track pad are good so no worries unless your not used having a NumPad to the right of the keyboard which requires you to slightly disposition your hands from the center of the laptop to the left which is slightly uncomfortable if you want to type papers. I usually keep my laptop on my desk since I've seen pictures of the 7559 (which has the same body as this laptop) being completely destroyed because of the hinge defect on these laptops. At first i was worried that this might happen to me but its been over 2 months since i bought this so my fears have settled but you should still be careful to not drop this laptop cause it will probably break unless you get the poly carbonate shell which will make this laptop stronger. the gaming side of this laptop is fine and the fans do get noisy when your gaming but its drowned out by the games so i really notice most of the time.As of right now dell released the new G series gaming laptops which start at $750 which is 100 dollars more but the quality is bound to be improved and it has HDMI 2.0 for 4K at 60HZ and a M.2 SSD NVME drive for crazy fast memory speed even faster then M.2 SSD(which is the best you can get for this laptop). For example SSD M.2 is 5 times faster then HDD and NVME SSD M.2 is 5 times faster then a M.2 SSD.. though NVME M.2 SSD's are much more expensive but will get cheaper in the future so you can always buy one separately and add it in yourself since dell gaming laptops are easy to upgrade.the upgraded hardware on the G3 means your more future proof with G3 series laptops then with this 5577 but that is not to say you wont be fine with this laptop since you still able to do work on this laptop and game.Overall i gave this laptop 4 stars since its decent and i got it for $636.50 ($676.28 with tax) so i recommend getting this if you don't intend to run a 4k at 60HZ monitor or require NVME and don't care about color accuracy on the display.P.S you can run 4K at 30HZ which is enough for movies. also the polycarbonate shell I am referring to is here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XDBVZW6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
The laptop functioned fine and was quick and responsive for the evening that I had it and had all the same specs as what I ordered. However, like a lot of the other reviews, I found the display quality to be terrible. It has more light bleed than my MSRP $300 laptop, color accuracy is low, brightness is low, and the viewing angles are terrible. The overall effect is a dull, imprecise display with only one angle where you can see what's on the screen. It makes no sense to put such a poor screen on a gaming laptop, even if the GTX 1050 isn't top of the line. Count on needing to hook up an external monitor to enjoy your visuals.A possible detractor for any potential buyer may be the red backlit keyboard AND red lettering. I wasn't expecting this to be such a pain in the neck to use, but I basically could not see the keys without leaning in. A minor annoyance if you type from memory, but I still do not know why anyone would put a red backlit keyboard on a laptop. As this is more personal preference, I haven't docked the rating for this.While the build is not phenomenal (it's plastic), I couldn't find any obvious structural weaknesses, and for the price I thought it was really good. Still, it's not rugged and you will need to be careful with it. I ended up returning it because of the display, and though I did have to pay return shipping, the seller treated me right, so no complaints there.
Great laptop. The only cons that I saw:- itâs the weight (5.6 pound) if you need to travel- The temperature located around the letters âuiopâ? âjkl;â?and â?./â?on the keyboard. Yo can feel the heat in that section when youâre using around 50% or 8GB Ram (16GB RAM Total) and a lot of process in your pc. As I use a wireless keyboard, It doesnât affect me the heat sensation on keyboard.- Laptop screen. Itâs ok... the colors are not very intense. Itâs a shame because it has powerful component. Iâm using 2 additional monitor, so it doesnât bother me anyway. For gaming itâs recommended that you use the hdmi built in port.But in overall itâs incredible fast without freezing moments at the moment ( using it by 45 days almost continuous)
I got tired of using older computers from work as a personal computer. Got tired of just minimal specs. I wanted FAST! I wanted 4 cores hyper threaded (8 logical processors). I wanted at least 2 GHz cores. I wanted 16gb memory and I wanted fast memory. I wanted a better resolution than what I had before (1366 x 768) so I could see more of each app I was using. And I wanted to finally have an SSD drive. This system was exactly what I needed. It's literally perfect. It boots up in 30 seconds. I no longer wait for Photoshop to open. I no longer wait for my financial app to open. Everything about it is super fast. I would recommend this to anyone needing a fast laptop.
Where to start, this laptop had so much problems it gave me a frigging headache. First the Windows update 1709 issue and so many other updates messed up the laptop and I couldn't do anything on it. Second the NVIDIA drivers or the hard drive it came with was damaged or something on arrival so I couldn't play anything or do anything. Third, Windows and Dell support couldn't do anything helpful, and this laptop wasn't as fast as advertised from the webpage. Thanks Dell and Amazon for a crappy laptop for over 500 dollars!
I reeeally like this laptop, very nice! Im not a huge online gamer but my boyfriend is, and he recommended this laptop for me. Im mostly using it for school and light use and some gaming. Ive had it for a fee days now and the only complaint was not the laptop itself but the microsoft store and updates- i had to download a few things for them to work corectly- kept freezing. Also it is a bit heavier than most computers but that doesnt bother me at all, just makes it less flimsy. I would recommend this laptop.
I bought this product a month ago and so far it has exceeded my expectations. The body is very rigid with little to no bend, yet the laptop is surprisingly light weight. The screen is a significant improvement over my previous laptop. Don't let the negative screen reviews dissuade you, this screen is one of the best matte TN panel screens I have seen on a laptop.The only downside to this laptop and issue that I have is on start up, the laptop freezes. This is an issue that is present on almost every start up of the device on both waking from sleep and powering on from being shut off. There is a simple work around by pressing ctrl + alt + delete and opening task manager but this is very inconvenient and there shouldn't be any reason to have a work around for a brand new laptop.
Have had mine for almost a month now and here's my thoughts.The keys have a nice matted texture that I enjoy. The backlight is very nice and even. Only complaint with it is it's defult is to fade after less than a minute but that's a setting issue only.It's light weight but feels very sturdy. The whole finish is matted, which I'm a fan of.Plenty of ports. Looks great. (Just like photos)The Screen. I read alot of reviews where this was the most disappointing part of the laptop due to quality issues. I find (switch to it from a high quality touch screen) that yes it is lacking a bit however as for as display quality I believe the issue lies more in the defult contrast and color settings. After looking up where to find the calibration setting I went through the steps and lowered contrast and brightness, then color sturation. After this the screen looked so much better. Complete game changer. I don't even think about it anymore. If you do alot of Photoshop for photo editing you may not want this laptop but I think thoes are the only people who need to worry about the screen.Of course if you can afford a higher price point and your worried about mind blowing display then go for another laptop. But for people wanting a laptop with a good processor AND graphics card for games and Adobe style products in this price range this is going to work great for you.Think it's more of a 4.5 because to get it to 5 you need to mess with the settings a bit.Have played games like league or ledgends, wow, and other online games (Been told it would run ARC as well)Use it for my graphic design classes and projects as well.
Excellent laptop. Much better battery than I had anticipated and the screen really isn't bad. Love that all the USB ports are USB 3.0. The red backlit keyboard and the overall design look great.I'd recommend getting rid of all the bloatware and using Dell's preinstalled update software to update everything, then install Nvidia's Geforce Experience app from the Microsoft Store to update the graphics drivers. The laptop is fast but the hard drive does get slowed down. I'll be moving the OS and some games to a M.2 SSD soon.Pros:-Great design, feel and sturdiness-Fast to boot-Strong graphics card-Long lasting battery-Fantastic priceCons:-Pretty weak speakers, but I only use headphones anyway-Screen quality is somewhat low but you really don't notice itThe pros vastly outweigh the cons so I definitely recommend it.
I had been contemplating a laptop for quite a while. This is my first as I have always gone the way of desktops until now. With how this computer is equipped, I feel like I got a hell of a deal. Gaming isn't as much of a priority as it had been in the past, but I do some coding and programming that requires some beefy specs. Having a 2.8GHz quad core with 16GB of RAM really makes things easy. And having the SSD makes it boot up in the blink of an eye. And the fans barely make any noise.The design is great. I love the red accents and backlit keyboard. It's not too cumbersome or too heavy to fit into the laptop pocket of my backpack for traveling.The only knock that I'm going to give it is what everyone is complaining about. The sound quality! It's awful! They're spotty, they crackle. Doesn't matter what volume level. It always happens.BUT!!! There is a fix.I connected headphones expecting for the quality to be better. But it was still bad. That means it's not the speakers. It has to be the sound card or drivers. I tried updating the Realtek drivers since that is the brand, but the update didn't fix it. I instead installed the default Windows drivers, and magically there were no more issues with sound.Even though I had to play with the drivers to fix the sound, I still consider it to be a solid buy. There is some bloatware that comes with it, but I deleted all of that. Works like a dream!
runs games at ultra/epic settings, fan noise is noticeable but i don't mind it. updated my i5 model to 16gb of ram 1tb SSD with a 250m.2 and its become a monster of a laptop for everything i throw at it, gaming, editing, web browsing. good budget laptop i can see it lasting a good few years.
My data science course and the experiments post that needed a power packed system. I was keen on the Mac book pro but the ~3k usd cost post taxes made me think again.My attention was on Lenovo legion Y520 , but saw some reviews of keyboard issues and dropped it. I was then looking for similar spec's and zeroed on this one. I picked this one in my last visit to US. The first one came with a tiny dead pixel in the middle of the screen(sadly) and Amazon was quick to get me a replacement before I left US. Amazon prime shipping helps!I went with the i7/512GB SSD and added a 2TB firecuda as there was an unused HDD slot. Now I feel I have a very good configuration.I read some reviews that it is heavy, yes I do agree as well. But ask yourself, do you need a lightweight ultra book which takes 2x times to process your tasks or a powerful laptop which is a desktop replacement?Barring the fan sound on occasions of heavy processing and 2X8GB RAM modules it came with (I would have liked it better had it come with 1x16GB module - you know its easier to get it to 32GB without any wastage), I felt it to be a decent pick. So far I love it!One star less for the bad pixel experience, but it's now a common practice for me to inspect pixels on any display devices I buy.
I bought this laptop for software development, it is great. I never experienced the issues other people experience. It just worked as expected.My project is one time project, I would not buy an expensive laptop. As long as it has 1050 GPU, it would work for me.Anyway, as a normal laptop, it worked and the laptop is pretty cool for a software developer.
Great packaging as usual.Works fantastic with no lags as I have installed fifa18 and have it connected via 20ft HDMI cable to my 40inch tv. Usually connects 4 controllers to the Laptop and the gameplay is seamless with absolutely no lags neith controller lags.Also installed Adobe Photoshop, Premier Pro and After Effects with all working perfectly.It has not overheated thus far.I would recommend to anyone
I brought this computer based on the amount of memory and the fact that it had a solid state drive. The boot time exceeded my expectations. I am not a fan of the darker keyboard even though it is backlite, it takes some getting use to. I am however happy with my purchase. The shipping time exceeded my expectation. The is my first laptop with a solid state drive and I would not got back to a regular drive. For me, 512 gig has been ample space.
Everything I could possibly want, beautiful graphics, runs great, and just overall stunning design.I plan to use this mainly as a computer where I'm not going to be transporting it anywhere, so I have high hopes this will last me for a long time.Very well done on the design Dell, I'm thoroughly impressed.
Alright, so, I have never had a laptop or PC and neither has anyone in my family. It goes without saying that I am no PC expert. However, if youâre looking for a laptop that can run most games, Netflix, youtube, etc- this is perfect. I bought it for school use with some personal use on the side, admittedly Iâve been spoiled to more personal use than school use. It runs games like Fortnite, State of Decay 2, Roblox, and Skyrim without any problems. It has AMAZING batter life. My ONLY complaint is the touchpad, which isnât a big deal since I usually use a Bluetooth mouse.In conclusion, if youâre skeptical and nervous like me and have no idea what to choose- give this a chance. Itâll do all the necessities and much more for a great price (:
I don't write a lot of reviews - but I have to say in the first week of use, this laptop is awesome. I'm not a pc gamer, so I can't tell you about that. But for basic programs, Internet, email, etc. one of the best machines I've ever used - and I work in IT for a livinging.
Love this. Its perfect for my work. It's like what I wanted, I like the dell brand, I've always bought equipment like that. It has a long duration. I hope this laptop lasts for another 10 years
Best bang for a $700ish dollar laptop.My past laptop which I used for College died on me a few days ago. I needed one urgently and after some research I determined that it was well balanced for it's price. I'm currently studying Computer Science and I must say this PC is perfect for programming and doing renders.
Conceptually, this PC is a powerful little devil, but (a) its main retail package includes Windows 10 Home (oh-lord...ah), and (b) it is unforgivably flimsy (as most game laptops are, but still...). Specifically, I bought the version with the 500GB SSD and 16GB RAM, and then I added a 2.5" HDD that I bought elsewhere, which allowed me to use the SSD for programs and the HDD for storage/docs.***The biggest pros include: 7700HQ processor, NVIDIA GTX 1050 video, near-full-size keyboard with num pad, non-glossy screen, drive bays for both SSD and HDD, plus ease of one-screw disassembly and access to battery, memory, and SSD/HDD (disassembly would be sooo painful if I instead were to buy the competing Asus VivoBook such as the M580VD-EB76... which I seriously considered FYI).***The biggest cons include: large form factor (the laptop footprint is much bigger than the size of the screen), Windows 10 Home (let's face it, the Home version is trash... and if you don't know that yet, you will soon), flimsy hinges (so flimsy I feel guilty opening and closing the lid), flimsy back panel (thin and weak), flimsy gills (the red-colored metal radiator gills are cute but are made of tin foil, quite literally... super-extra flimsy), flimsy body (so flimsy I can bend it visibly by using only two fingers of each hand to twist it in opposite directions), no video out except one HDMI port (you will need to buy USB to VGA Video Graphics Adapters to extend your desktop, which are $30 to $35 each - by the way, I recommend the ones made by Pluggable brand), and finally, with Windows 10 Home edition this PC is simply NOT cheap.***One last tip: people who say that the sub-woofer on this laptop makes it sound awesome are either deaf or have really low expectations or working for Dell - ignore them and accept the fact that the sub-woofer is going to suck, and all subwoofers sized like a penny always suck. But also remember, Dell has simply never been great at delivering awesome speaker audio systems. I recall how a few years ago I was seconds ago from clicking the ORDER button on Amazon to buy a new "entertainment laptop"... but while eyeballing the features for the last time on the page, I noticed that this so-called "entertainment" (ssssh.....) laptop had just one - that's not two but one, ladies and gentlemen - speaker on it. What does this tell you? This tells you how Dell sees audio as part of a laptop - they think great audio is - well - nice but not required. Hence the subwoofer that doesn't look or sound like one.***In conclusion, would I recommend this laptop? Yes, but only - and I mean ONLY - if size factor isn't super important to you AND if you are concerned with being able to easily open the back panel to tweak your system, which is one thing that this laptop does like no other: it requires removal of just ONE SCREW to remove the entire back panel for access to the guts (and as you may have suspected, I am very pleased with that!)
This laptop is pretty good for the money but comes with a few KNOWN ISSUES!! Come'on Dell! The fan noise is unbearable!!! They would spin at full speed just while browsing the web with a few tabs open.No heavy processing at all!! Dell's technical support was pretty much useless and could not troubleshoot this KNOWN ISSUE. Unacceptable quality control from Dell. I'm not a computer wiz but did some heavy investigating to fix this. If you're having issues with crackling audio just update the audio drivers and it should fix it. To fix the fan issue you'll need to update the BIOS to most current available. Then go into the power plan settings and change from "Dell" to "balanced". Then go to advanced setting within that power plan and lower the "maximum processor state" to about 70-80% This has seemed to worked for me but you might want to tweek the settings to your liking. You might not even have to update the bios but might as well. So much better and has not affected the performance of the laptop. The fans were so damn loud I was about to return this laptop. A $1000 laptop should have never left the factory with KNOWN ISSUES like this!! This is my 1st Dell and will most certainly be my last. Unacceptable to have to troubleshoot all these issues!! Dell as a courtesy and in good faith, should extend the warranties on this model for selling defective laptops. Use caution before deciding to purchase a Dell product.
Got this computer (512 gb SSD, 16 gb RAM) a day ago and it's pretty much everything I wanted and more. Has all the ports I need for school with the power to play games whenever I have extra time. I haven't really dealt with the display too much because I use an external monitor but from what I've seen so far the display is pretty decent.The only gripe I have is that the fans get fairly loud when you're working the CPU too hard but other than that it's been a great purchase. I got the ASUS equivalent about half a month back and was incredibly unsatisfied with that laptop. You are definitely making a great choice in getting this one.
Good price, great laptop, quiet with SSD!
Great budget gaming laptop but I would recommend adding an SSD to it because the hard drive is pretty slow for windows 10. But other than that its great.
Amazing price for a good working laptop for not only schoolwork use but is ALSO able to handle art programs like Photoshop and Toon Boom Harmony and Adobe Animate, and for playing high graphic games like Overwatch. As a college student and artist, I highly recommend this laptop if you love gaming with high graphics with ease on your free time, creating art and while doing schoolwork. Worth the price and I love it and use it everyday wherever I go and whenever I need it. Great for taking on the go too.
A terrific computer, fast as I expected, and reasonably priced for a gaming machine. While I am not a gamer, I like to over-build laptops so they last longer. My last HP was still working fairly well at 6 years old., because I selected the fastest chip and a machine with better capabilities when I had it built.
So far this laptop has worked fantastic for playing games on Steam and Origin. I haven't had any problems with it. I love the glowing red keyboard, the sound is fine, the graphics look good. It's pretty heavy so not sure I'll be carrying it around much. You can hear the fan but it's not that loud, in my opinion. Maybe some reviewers are expecting way too much for a lower priced laptop?
What I liked most. Hhmm well it sounds pretty good. Guess that is about it.What I don't like. It's painfully slow. In every area, just processing a simple update takes forever. Screen blanks out to black often and it just seems to be tired and struggles to keep up. I have used this over multiple wifi and wired connections with the same result. It's frustrating to say the least and I regret the purchase.
Itâs only been a couple of days but I have absolutely no complaints with this. You get what you pay for. It handles my game, and multiple other things at once. Iâm happy with my purchase, fully.
Right out of the box, this laptop hangs, hesitates or freezes. The system seems to hesitate, every few minutes, for anywhere from 5 seconds to several minutes. You get the "busy" spinning circle, and nothing responds. We are returning this asap, as this laptop is unusable in this condition. Will be ordering a different brand.
Computer freezes/hangs often. Had it hard crash on me multiple times and then it finally wouldn't boot to windows, had to send it out for repair.
I am so glad I purchased this laptop. Itâs a great product at a great price and only takes a minute or so to boot up. I was shocked at how fast it booted up. The only thing that surprised me is that it doesnât have a cd drive and this is why Iâm only giving 4 stars. I thought I checked over the specs pretty carefully, but guess not LOL
Works great after all the updating and new hard drive.I replaced the 1tb 5400 hard drive with a crucial m.2 500gig.The boot time went from 45 sec to 5 sec. Programs start very fast.Screen Is okay. I most likely won't be replacing that.The keyboard is really nice. The backlit red looks good.The computer is very sturdy.I would recommend, but definitely replace the hard drive.
You know when you meet someone and click with them right away? That's what happened when I got this laptop and turned it on. No words can fully describe how much I love my new Dell Inspiron. The design is marvellous and the audio system is extremely pleasing to the ear. I won't even go on about the amazing performance and specs.
Nvidia was the most important feature that enhanced its performance for the needs of CAD work, according to my niece who was the beneficiary of this gift, starting her engineering degree program.
the sound of the laptop is distorted, it is supposed to have a good sound card butcher this sucks, the seller did not answer for this problem
Boy was I disappointed with this thing. Let me go over some quick pros & cons so you can get through this review quickly.+ Amazing build quality: Super sturdy, no screen flex+ Aesthetics: I love the more subdued look, not too "gamer-y" for a laptop with a 1050+ Keyboard: Enjoyed the feel and key placements- Screen: Holy crap, this thing is *bad*. I am not a picky person when it comes to screens, but this TN panel is awful. Colors are beyond bad, the screen looks constantly dirty, and the 1080p resolution can easily pass for 900p- Performance & Speed: This thing runs slower than my Mid-2012 MacBook Pro, no joke. I tried living with it, but it's absurdly slow. Even after removing all bloatware and defragmenting the HDD, it still "runs" like a slug.- Performance (continued): This carries over into game performance, where I was getting 30-40fps during fights in Overwatch. For those who don't know, a 1050 and i5-7300u are more than enough for something like Overwatch, but I was getting that frame rate even when set to 720p low settings. This is after ensuring all drivers are updated and the game was using my 1050 and not the integrated GPU. I also made sure the laptop was favoring performance. No change. I almost certainly received a defective unit, as this can't possibly be normal.All-in-all, I don't recommend simply based off of my experience. If you buy the SSD variant, don't get a defective unit, and can ignore the ugly screen, it's a nice laptop. But given my issues with speed and performance, I'll be returning my unit and looking elsewhere.
Great laptop for my casual gaming and business apps. Don't give up on the TN screen, after a few Dell updates it is fine for my purposes. If you need to use more graphic based apps you may want to look to another like the XPS laptop.
Everything is as expected, shipping was fast, and everything ran great.My only area of concern are going to be how the hinges behave after a few months of opening/closing repeatedly.Notes:I also added an M2 card as my OS drive and upgraded the RAM with a pair of 8G sticks repurposing the existing one in a different machine. An M2 card is an extremely worthwhile upgrade in regards to this machine.
I just got mine yesterday and so far I love it. I will updated my review if any issues come up. I can run Dark Souls 3 on high settings and get 40-50 fps. Laptop doesn't feel cheaply made and honestly feels very nice which suprised me. Also if you do get this product make sure you update everything before using. I noticed a few issues before doing so but as soon as I updated everything and rebooted it ran perfectly.
Bought this as a gift for my adult gamer son. He is very well pleased with it. Everything he wanted this Dell Gaming Laptop has!
The performance and built quality is amazing. The laptop boots up extremely fast and plenty of RAM really helps if you into coding or data science.There's just one issue that many other DELL users have also mentioned. Certain applications like VLC, Codeblocks get pixellated despite the laptop supporting that level of graphics. Maybe there are some display compatibility issues.Overall, this laptop is an extremely good option in this price.
Great computer, excellent design, it's fast and great for gaming
Got sold this by origin electronics. Laptop arrived. Switched it on and all i get is 100% disk use. Have tried everything form diagnostics to factory reset and even changing things in registry. Still getting 100% use. Avoid this product and seller!!!
It's an okay laptop for Cyber Monday purchase.But it says 3.5 GHz processor in details while it actually is 2.5 GHz.
POS won't even turn on...couldn't afford insurance, so now I'm stuck with two bricks hinged together.
just perfect, really solid ,like how the charger light
I bought a Dell Inspiron 15 5000 brand new as gift to my sister and i sent it to her out of the US and the laptop was without a windows key , and when i called the Dell support number they didn't do anything to me.
Good value under $700US. CPU chip and GFx can handle a lot. The 1TB HDD is cheap and slow so it really needs its OS installed on an SSD and at least 16GB RAM for heavy multitasking or gaming. Annoying Dell power settings come setup for battery life, so get into the advanced settings if you're wondering why the laptop is running like drunk preschooler.
It's a large laptop, but if you are looking for solid build and lots of features, it's a good choice. I had some problems at the beginning like internet connection and screen freezing but after updating, the problems were solved. Also, when I experience these problems, I contacted the company and they were very kind and really problem solver.
You will have to move the screen up and down to see clearly especially in dark games. It is really annoying to have 80% brightness in some games without any benefit. Any change in your sitting position needs adjustment in screen position.
Son loves it...and the colors on the keyboard are so cool :)
Powerful machine. Price is not undefeatable.
I got this laptop about a month ago and still runs great. I'm mostly working on it (GIS and CAD) and it runs strong and powerful for the kind of work I'm doing. The battery lasts a long time so it's great for when I am in meetings or conferences.What I like the most about this laptop is it's performance/price ratio, the keyboard is awesome (although the pad does faults at times) and the excellent design that combines "work" with "fun" which makes it appropriate for more business-y meetings.What I dislike about it though is that it comes with 2x of 8gb of RAM which makes the RAM upgrade totally impractical (I was hoping to come with 1x of 16gb of RAM and the other slot to be empty for a future 16gb RAM upgrade). However, realistically speaking probably I will never need the 32gb...and my work with being done perfectly fine on 16gb as well (so, personal preference).Hope this help. I will post an upgrade after several months of use and share my thoughts after longer use.Stay awesome!
It was good while it lasted, screen and base disconnected after 6 months of usage so that sucked. But overall the specs on the computer were just right for my gaming niece.
Only have it two stars, mostly for style, not even two months owning this laptop and already faced slow performance with the hard drive causing most of the slow down in performance, not to mention they use a cheap drive for this laptop, being that it's a gamer laptop you would think they would use a much better hard drive built for gaming rather than an ordinary hard drive, anyways was very disappointed with this laptop even with all the tweaks that I used to supposedly stop the 100% disk usage issue, did not fix the problem as the performance issue came back a couple days later, in the end I just returned it for a refund and will just order next time with the components I want in a gaming laptop, at least I'll get what I pay for next time
This is a very sturdy and solid laptop, that is one thing I like about Dell laptops. Aside from the specs, the screen is well suited for gaming since it has a higher response rate than IPS screens. Recently have upgrade my 8GB Ram with another 8GB ballistics Crucial Ram totalling to 16GB and upgraded to a 2 TB Seagate with the extra cache included. Response time is amazing. Only left is to put the SSD. One thing though... When i was taking off the HDD bracket.. Three screws were locked so tight that i had to precisely cut the bracket so i can have at least half of it to put it back with the newly upgraded HDD. Now.. Dell.. Unfortunately wamted me to pay to it the service. Even under warranty within the first month and a half ..it is technically a defect, and they want me to fork over forty something dollars and send it to the service center also, and i can't do it cause i am in college.. Although i would not take a star away.. but i really dislike dell costumer service because of this..
Very great affordable gaming laptop. The specs donât lie. For the price of this laptop, its hard to get much more than what this laptop provides, I have yet to run into a game it canât play and its remarkably fast and is also fashionable
This laptop is amazing I have no complaints, everything works perfectly and it shipped rather quickly. If you're looking for a middle price gaming computer and you need it mobile this has everything you need. My only complaint is that I didn't spend the extra money for the upgraded CPU.
Good laptop
One of the budget gaming laptop around!
Super disappointed. White screen after 2 hours of use, totally unresponsive- we returned it because research into this problem points to faulty hardware
I like it, looks cool. I travel with it, and had TSA take a double look at it from the cool looks. I does what I need from it. I'm an IT student.
I like the computer, heavier than I would like, and prefer older versions of Windows.
Thank you fast shipping. The only problem is sound. I think that the speakers does not have good quality. i can hear the sizzles on high volume...
Maybe I've would've liked it but I was sold a defective laptop. The only reason I'm rating two is because the amazon employees were absolutely amazing at helping me get a refund.
just running a browser, and the fan are running like crazy.specs are fine.came with a loose screw, can hear it rolling around inside the laptop when I tilt it around... poor quality check.
A decent gaming laptop. Only thing I'm going to complain about is that the Battery life is only 2 hours not 7 as they advertised.
I have the i7, 512GB SSD, with 16GB of RAM. I got this laptop because I needed a powerful laptop to run programs like SolidWorks and ANSYS but that was a reasonable price and small enough to bring to class. This laptop is not as small or light as the 2 in 1 ultra thin laptops but it is not big and bulky. I had an old 17.3" laptop before this and compared to that this is tiny. But the 15.6 still has a big enough screen for multitasking with multiple windows. The batter life is great. I have not timed it but it seems to be outstanding. I have played Player Unknown Battlegrounds and it handled it great, although it ate a ton of battery. It is fast and responsive. Super sleek looking. Full keyboard is nice. I like that it has 3 USB 3.0 ports and an Ethernet. The only complaints would be the outside does smudge very easily, the fans are pretty loud, and there seems to be quite a bit of bloat ware. Seems to use up a lot of RAM when idling or web surfing.
Awesome laptop for a great price! One small complaint however with dell regarding dells help towards putting windows 7 on this machine...There are windows 7 drivers but the drivers available are incomplete. Dell customer support wanted me to pay money to get windows 7 on this laptop. I eventually found drivers that are compatible by gigabyte for the chipset. The processor is kaby lake and because of that smaller nano circuitry windows 7 should not be compatible. I installed Windows 7 without any updates , then installed as many drivers as I could and the graphics acceleration didn't work so I installed windows 7 sp1and finally everythijng worked! Awesome power. No glitchiness or instability.
I liked that it worked great out of the box. Is a pretty fast computer for the price. My only gripe was that I had to go pick it up as it was not delivered to my house.
I have used this laptop for about two weeks and here are my reviews. At first, when the laptop arrived, I was not impressed by neither its speed nor performance. It seemed quite slower than it is advertised. So, I decided to return but before I did that, I gave it another try. Because a new laptop comes with 1 year warranty from Dell, you can always find free help from a Dell representative and they will take over control of your laptop and tries to fix it.He eliminated some of the pre-installed drivers, bloatwares and updated Dell BIOS. After this took place, it became a screaming fast laptop. So, once you receive the laptop, please check with the Dell rep and ask him/her to eliminate any bloatware and drivers that came with. They, for instance, deleted audio driver and replaced it with a driver that is default with Microsoft. Now, it has become much faster than before :)
I have the laptop less than a week ago and although its screen is not the best, the performance is incredible. And the sound is also acceptable, not as they say in the reviews
I received mine a couple days ago but even thought the wireless icon appears as if the laptop is connected to internet the computer can't to the internet unless I use an ethernet cable, i'm think i'm going to return it because i have tried everything and nothing seems to work i'm getting very annoyed by this issue
Product came as espected. I paid a good price for it ($630) but I wouldn't recomend to buy it for $700 or $800, as it would be too expensive for what it comes with.
Horrible!!!! Laptop was freezing out of the box! CPU failed 5 days into owning it. Only good part is I had a full refund in 10 days. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT PLEASE!!!
Great for the price. Install a SSD and it'll be perfect
Very good
Have had it for about 6 months and it's been the best gaming laptop I've owned. Searched far and wide for something with similar specs and this was the best deal I could find at the time (now it's gone done in price slightly).Runs quiet, relatively cool, and I've had zero problems. Fantastic performance (60+ fps) on all current gen games at 1080p usually set to high quality. The laptop keyboard is only OK, and the trackpad is mediocre. I play with an external keyboard, mouse, and monitor and I'd say that's the best setup for it. My second Dell laptop and I've yet to have a bad experience at all with them.
better to save your money to buy, the newer dell, this one has a few gitches here and there but for me, it aint too bad
It's perfect, very fast and strong.
it an excellent computer, but sometimes it lags (maybe thats the correct term),
Very, Very good!
I love this, computer. Right now I'm testing it's performance, but right now everything is working fine. Recommended. I'll update if something change.
Works really well. Runs better when plugged in. However, it loses internet pretty easily when your router has a poor internet speed.
Excellent laptop
Exelent computer for games. I don't see problems yet.
works as designed
The absolute slowest computer I have ever used. Brand new and it takes over 5 minutes to boot. I updated all the drivers and that made it boot about 10 seconds faster. Playing anything on it slows the thing to a crawl. I manage to pull framerates of about 8 sometimes. Buy a potato - itâll work better than this piece of garbage. I want my money back.UPDATE: computer wonât even boot up now. DO NOT buy this sack of garbage.
Great performance with a low price.The only bad thing is the poor screen quality, but acceptable with this price.
Pretty good, the bloatware is annoying though. I got mine open box for $650 so not a bad deal at all for the price.
A beautiful laptop and the hardware competes with most higher end PCs, I'm very happy with it!
so far i really love the laptops performance for the price paid
Excellent components for the price. Fast, easy to use. Delivery as expected.
I really liked the computer but it completely stopped working 3 weeks ago. Wont turn on.
Really great laptop.NOTE: i see everyone saying the screen is really bad, it really isn't. I suppose if you're coming from a IPS with great quality then maybe, but otherwise, the tn that this laptop comes with is good.Fans are quiet, don't even really turn on with general use. When gaming they spins but are almost unnoticable.I got 40fps in Skyrim at ultra settings and 36 FPS on Neverwinter at highest settings.ALSO if your browser sticks and goes unresponsive, turn off the "Hardware Acceleration" feature in the browser's settings.
So far, this laptop has been worth every dollar spent on it. It has a few stutters here and there but nothing to complain or worry about. It comes with the GTX 1050 4gb card which is not the Ti version of this card.Only gave it 4 stars because I haven't tried gaming on it as yet but I'm sure it will power through almost any game you throw at it at medium to high settings and some times ultra.
I bought this machine to provide a mobile option supporting my work in advanced data modeling and analytics, and for that purpose it's excellent. At the price there was really no competition for this Dell -- it's is a solidly built machine that meets all the critical performance benchmarks I had on my shopping list (super-fast 512Gb NVMe SSD, quad-core I7 (2.8-3.8Ghz) at 45W, and 16Gb of DDR4 memory (upgradeable to 32Gb). Sure, I have a business workstation and personal desktop that meet other computing needs this laptop can't. And so, yes, when someone complains about the display specs, or the lack of USB 3.1, or touts the advantage of spending $300-500 more to upgrade this or that component -- I get it. But I'm very happy with my choice in this case.One final point: No small consideration for me was the combination of (1) a Dell machine backed by a 1-year warranty and supported by some easy-as diagnostic and maintenance tools, and (2) Amazon's stellar no-worries, 2-day delivery service for its Prime customers.
Cool design. Powerful. Beautiful display. Light and built very well, very solid.
Excellent product! It achieves all the expectatives for design and gaming
Bought this laptop knowing the screen wasn't the best. Read the other reviews and thought it couldn't be that bad, well it is but I plan on replacing it down the line and I'm happy with the performance so I'm going to keep it. Ordered the laptop and at the same time I ordered:Â Crucial 8GB DDR4 2400 MT/S (PC4-19200) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory (CT8G4SFS824A)Â andÂ ADATA SU800 M.2 2280 128GB Ultimate 3D NAND Solid State Drive (ASU800NS38-128GT-C)The upgrade of 8GB memory and the 128GB SSD really makes this a great performing laptop. Did the install before turning the laptop on the first time, took it out of the package, removed one screw, removed the cover plate and installed the SSD and SODIIM, closed it up and fired it up for the first time. The laptop recognized the added memory without any additional steps needed on my behalf. I let the system run it's start up and after it was ready to use I downloaded the image program offered by ADATA on their web site, transferred the drive to the SSD and rebooted, they system automatically recognized the new boot drive, once I confirmed the transfer was good to do I reformatted the 1T hard drive into a storage drive and now have a fast booting system with plenty of memory for $827.94 bucks (Laptop was $709, SSD $55.99 and SODIMM $62.95). Not a bad deal. Watch the prices on Amazon, they go up and down often. Add the parts you want to your cart and save for later or put them in a Wish List. Buy when they hit your price point.Now for the screen, since I started using the laptop I have had headaches, I don't know if it's because I'm using it more than my 7 year old XPS 1703 Dell or if it's because of the screen. I'm going to blame the screen. I plan on swapping it out for an IPS screen like one reviewer constantly points out in his reviews and comments. Reading the how-to it appears to be something I could do easily and the screen was priced at under $70 when I last checked.As for performance, this machine is great, I was able to play Skyrim on max settings, kick some tail on Players Unknown Battlegrounds and effortlessly surf the web with many browser windows open. Great laptop for not a lot of money. Some might say I had to MOD the computer to get this performance and to a point this is true, however I searched and didn't find another machine in this price range with this level of hardware for a comparable price. To me it was well worth the additional effort to make this laptop meet my needs.
My 30 fps life is now forever gone!
laptop screen was not working
Some lags but overall itâs ok
Update: Do NOT be fooled by the great specs & great price, this is a horribly slow, unusable and now unreturnable piece of crap.Update2: Bad WiFi card, using an external and it works good. I updated to 3 stars from 1 because there is NO support and apparently no warranty, and a short return period. If you get a bad unit as others have implied, youâre basically screwed. I had to self-diagnose and repair it myself.
Amazing laptop perfect for gaming
The look and feel of this laptop is great, the laptop boots fast, runs smoothly, the screen colors are ok, the keyboard feels sturdy and the trackpad works nice, the only issue I had so far is the additional software added to the os, it's very intrusive, the included antivirus is specially annoying, constantly crashing full screen apps for no good reason and windows is constantly downloading and installing unwanted apps. I would give five stars to this laptop if the included software were less annoying.
Fantastic Lap top
I feel this laptop has potential. The laptop I received had glitches from the beginning. I held out hope. It turned out that I received a defective laptop as the glitches only grew worse. (Luckily I returned it within the 30 days and currently await my refund.) However, when it worked, it worked well. I am not a gamer but I do create art in Photoshop and prefer working at a minimum of 1200 dpi. This laptop was recommended to me by a friend who knows everything about everything. (He is a god or an alien I suspect.) For the short time I had this laptop Photoshop Elements 15 worked like a dream with files large enough to shut down a computer with 4G ram. Anyway, I wish I hadn't received a lemon but am considering trying again. Issues included loss of sound, frozen screens, fans running as loud as an air conditioner, but the loss of sound was the last straw. Too long a story to type but it ruined what was going to be a wicked Netflix night.
Ana amazing laptopð
I purchased this as a replacement laptop for my wife, who games a lot. This was delivered to me with what I believe to be a faulty hard drive. I know everything there is to know about computer hardware, so read on to find out how I attempted to solve the problem.From the get-go, we found boot times to be abysmally slow and performance once inside Windows was just as bad. Sluggish programs that took ages to open, slow installs and transfers and 100% disk usage reported by task manager on a near constant basis. That seemed to me like a sign of an either bad hard drive or Windows 10 being Windows 10. I tried various tweaks to Windows to improve disk performance, but nothing seemed to work. I then ran chkdsk, which found no issues with the (generic WD) drive (you don't want to know how long that chkdsk run took). So I decided to resort to buying a new high-performance hard drive replacement to avoid sending the laptop back and waiting for weeks for a refund or replacement. The laptop performed admirably in games after all, which at least signified that the CPU and GPU have no issues.In the end, a new hard drive seems to have been what was needed. No more taking ages to boot, transfer files and 100% disk usage. Having to spend extra money and stress over having to fix a brand new laptop has me obviously pissed off, though.Another thing I should mention. You CAN run Windows 7 on this laptop, if you change the boot mode to Legacy, but you will not be able to game on it, which is a shame because Windows 10 is an abomination. Intel has not released Windows 7 graphics drivers for this CPU gen (on purpose, to push Windows 10). You can technically find a way around this restriction and install the drivers by modifying the Windows 10 drivers themselves, but they will still be non-functional in this particular model because it has switchable graphics. Thank Intel and Microsoft for this.
Horrible fan management, they start going full throttle when the computer is already stuck. Overheats easily unless lifted even on normal surfaces. Not happy.
No problems with this product for me. Was able to clean install windows easily. The computer does not lag one bit. It does come with the TN display. Fortunately, it is really easy to replace the screen with a IPS panel and I highly recommend doing that. For a laptop, it is on the heavy side, but it makes sense for the hardware that it has. Really overall love this laptop.
The system doesn't work as fast as it should be.CPU performance wasn't great.Fans keep buzzing all the time.Audio Driver wasn't great it inserts a junk voice when you are playing video content. Doesn't even look like new
It's too soon to tell how much I will love or hate this laptop. Right out of the box, after plugging it in and starting the Windows 10 setup (and inevitable updates) an error message popped up that there was permanent battery failure and I have to replace the battery. I immediately contacted Amazon and they were very helpful, but it doesn't alter the fact that after rushing delivery of the laptop I now have to wait another week to get a replacement battery. Amazon doesn't carry them so I either had to send the laptop back for a refund and reorder it, or go through Dell for the new battery. I am used to using Dell computers for work; I expected more from this. - Maybe after I get an actual fully functioning computer I will be able to update this review for the better. We'll see.
a very powerfull machine just for gaming, nice sound when you need power, very good processor and nice amunt of memory. very strong body bilt..
Let me start by telling you a little about myself. I have a masters of science in computer information science from Everest University, a masters degree in computer programming from ITT and a Doctoral of science in computer science also from ITT. Saying that I will now give my review on this laptop. It was giving to me as a gife almost a month ago and I would never thing that it would stack up with my Asus G751JY Gaming laptop. After all that is one of the best gaming laptops made that cast over $5,000.00. And to get this gaming laptop for around $1.000.00 is remarkable. It is the perfect gaming laptop for anyone that doesn't want to pay a lot for a gaming laptop. Thank you for reading my reviewBest wishes Dr. M Brock PHD MOS
Underperforming is an overstatement. Trying to play games that are over 5 years old and the computer glitched and locks up. The computer runs very hot quickly. Bad design poor performance. Look elsewhere
So, I've been using this laptop for like a month and one night I see that the screen is black, after waiting for a while I just push the off button and when I turned it on I got a Windows error.I restored the laptop and this green lines appeared, but not only that, windows started to work very slow and with a lot of problems.
very good love the lighted keyboard. great price and excellent for gaming
This runs worse than my old laptop. My games freeze, the search time lags, and I can't play Sims 4. Haven't had a chance to try other games. I've had it for about 24 hours and I'm printing the return label now.
Great quality notebook, I like the design and the product it is made of.This notebook is incredibly fast and can run games with heavy graphics easily.
I thought I should ignore the bad reviews, as there were a few glowing ones - and still try the computer.I hated everything about it. The keyboards backlight didnât work well, the webcam for Skype kept cutting out in the middle of video calling and the sound was also subpar.The most frustrating thing however, was how slow everything is. After deleting the bloatware it seemed to do nothing to improve the speed. Iâve never returned an item to amazon before and hopefully the return is proceessed soon.TL;DR: save your money for a laptop of better quality.
fast delivery and easy to replaced. I,m glad i didn't have to replaced the whole grill now with the new burners its like new!
While its a good laptop, very disappointed that original power supply did not work!!Its not possible to get international warranty and dell support would give you a run around to different departments.
great just what my grandson wanted
On the first day of use, this laptop freezes constantly and won't even tab out.I've had same Dell Inspiron which I used for little more than a year that has the same problem and that is why I bought this one.I guess it's just intrinsic problem with all Dell laptops.
Good support by Dell!
in 2nd day of use....speakers are making static noise (disturbances) ...while playing audio from youtube.I see similar issue reported by other customers.....seems to be real issue not just with me.Dell has to fix this
I've never had a new computer run this slow. So disappointed with this purchase.
So far, absolutely pathetic. I've only had it a few hours and it struggles to run the most basic tasks. The display, some have mentioned, is lack-luster. Let me clarify and say that I would get better clarity and color from a slide-projector out in broad-daylight. The 8gb of ram and Core i5 run slower than my Lenovo Tablet with a single core Atom processor and 2gb of ram. The good news is that if there is a flood in your area, you can stay afloat on the incredible amounts of bloatware that come with this. This laptop also claims to have an Nvidia GTX 1050. I'd let you know how it works, but so far it doesn't even recognize its existence and would rather use Intel HD Graphics. I BOUGHT A GAMING LAPTOP AND IT'S USING INTEL HD GRAPHICS!? Incredible! I must sayâ?Dell really outdid themselves on this one. I hope their team enjoyed all the time the took off during the development of this laptop, because this truly feels like a product designed in a few hours. Incredibly pathetic. This has to go back. Last Dell I own. Period.
Good price awesome laptop
Disk is always laggy
very good, sensitive to blows
The bloatware prevents this from receiving five stars
This laptop might be the most worthless computer I've ever owned. The 1050 in it is undoubtedly underpowered, as I can't even run Terraria on it, which is one of the lowest impact games you can get.If you restart it or have to update it, forget about using it for at least an hour, because you'll just sit and watch it load and listen to the fans blast full on for minutes before anything will load.I can build a PC that would put this thing to shame for under half the money I spent on this and I genuinly feel like I was robbed. So dissapointing.If you're getting it just for web browsing, I would recommend saving 3-4 hundred and getting a toaster, it would surely compete.
Very nice price and having 16gb of ram was important
Very good laptop, performance, graphics, etc., i recommend it
Very VERY slow for that price laptop
This machine is Excellent! It has an awesome performance
Great Product!. Thanks
A great laptop, i made the right decision.
The box was opened laptop was covered with dust. Laptop was damaged ( cannot boot).I think it was returned item. Who can belive this is new one and I received 12 minutes ago.
I won't recomend this laptop, firstable this processor won't overclock to 3.5Ghz since the TDP of the proccesor is lowered by the manufactury it will only stay at 2.5Ghz that is actually slow the only reason this got 2 stars is for its sound quality but is to Sloooooow get a better one with your money.
Christmas presents
this computer is terrible it freezes all the time right out of the box
In my opinion it must have at least 18GB of memory because it suffer a lot to open any application. For sure more memory will let this machine much better and we will enjoy much more
I got this laptop for work because I needed the CPU, well I got what I wanted, but the screen is so bad it is already showing dead pixels left and right and there're no ways to fix them without replacing the screen
there is hissing noise from the HDD....very annoying
Disaster. The computer is insanely slow and nothing I do fixes it. Uninstalled things, reset it, ran diagnostics... This is a scam and I want my money back.
it is not good. 1. sometimes it will restrart. 2. the Windows10 is slow. 3. I met once this situation. The screen said restarting after i took a shower. But i didn't restart the laptop and i was watching live TV. When it finished restarting, i typed in my password and it said login. Then i went to take a coke. The screen was close when i came back. Everything could work except the screen. I don't know what it is wrong. I don't like it.
Why does my one-day old laptop hang? I ordered one. It was hanging, there was some hissing noise constantly from the speakers. Then I went for a replacement and this new laptop hangs as well!
Needed a new computer for grad school that could handle some of the modeling programs that my 6 year old computer couldn't because of the graphics card. Nvidia with intel is a nice combo for getting the job well done. The only problem I had was the delivery of the laptop. The package delivery area was under construction and the delivery person left it unattended in the construction zone, when there were signs posted informing deliveries to be put in another area.
It has really good specs on paper but is dreadfully slow. Iâve even reinstalled everything. Donât buy!
Full of slow adware and honestly not fast enough for gaming. Has trouble with simple flash games. Pretty repugnant
This laptop did not show up as advertised. Instead of the listed 3.5GHz CPU, I received a much slower 2.5GHz CPU.
Dell Tech Support asked me how to spell "Linux".Dell Tech Support is COMPLETELY useless for Linux.Dell Tech Support DISAVOWS any knowledge of Ubuntu or RHEL.It took me 3 days to install Linux on the 5577.The Dell Inspiron 5577 is AMAZING with Linux Mint.Puts any Windows Pro machine to SHAME.All of my clients (5000+) will be SELLING their MacBook Pros.I have been a System and Network Integrator for 27 years.Unhappy computer people call me.I recommend the hardware and software combinations to help my clients find their happy place.Linux on Dells has been helping me do that for clients for 3 months.14:36 I call DELL Warranty Transfers.The first agent tells me I am in the wrong place.The second agent spends a lot of time telling me what I canNOT do and why.I ask for a supervisor.15:10 The second agent places me on hold.15:15 The second agent transfers me to a third agent.This agent also tells me what I canNOT do.I have transferred ZERO warranties.I point this out to the third agent.I suggest that the DELL Warranty Transfer system is failing.15:30 I ask for a supervisor.15:43 The third agent comes back to let me know ALL supervisors are in a meeting.I ask if he is sure... because I am posting details of our call to all public media and several publications.15:44 Mayank hangs up on me.69 MINUTES WASTED.15:45 I call ASUS.The call is very clear.The ASUS agent volunteers her name.I can understand everything the agent says.She answers several technical questions.She answers several administrative questions.I ask if I may open an ASUS account... YES.LOOK... no more DELLS.
Lags horribly and crashes constantly
It's a no-go for me. Mine came with a damaged hard disc drive. Have to use the waranty.
Good laptop but the charging cord is trash. I breaks within 2 months if you do anything except use it as a desktop machine. Dell's warranty is not worth the paper it is printed on and will not be honored. I cannot recommend spending 700 for a laptop then having to spend an additional 40 every 2 months on new charging cords. Any type of frequent movement (ie adjusting how you are sitting while reading in bed on the laptop) causes the power cord to separate from the plug that goes into the computer.UPDATE: The day after posting this review I received a call from a higher up in dell customer service. They upheld the warranty and sent a new cord. When I received the new cord it was obvious that the original cord was defective from the beginning which could happen with any product. Other then the cord issue it is a good reasonably priced gaming laptop.
Same problem as many documented here where the case is literally ripping apart near the charging port, making it essentially unusable. The laptop has also stopped picking up wifi without being two feet or less away from the router, which I would assume is related to the fact that the computer is just falling apart from normal (and I'd even say minimal) use and I don't think I can perfectly seal off the interior of the laptop from the outside environment.You should probably follow the old adage that "you get what you pay for" and pay a little more for something that isn't of appalling quality. It worked fine when I just got it before the issues started to crop up after a few months, but it is pretty much useless now.
Computer seems nice, but I have had to get 2 in a row so far and neither one works at all. The start up fine, but then cant load regular websites like email or facebook and regularly restart themselves every 30 minutes or so. Tried updating, tried reformatting to factory settings and all other kinds of fixes..... Spent days trying to troubleshoot both laptops and no luck with either one. You know there is an issue when you get multiple laptops that have the same exact issue right out of the box.If you want a working laptop, don't buy this one. You will be disappointed.
I got a great deal on a Dell 5577 so i made the purchase. The specs on this laptop for the money are great so I had high expectations on the performance. I was not disappointed, I benchmarked it and was very happy with it for the money. The problems for me, however, were: very poor tn display, cheap keyboard and terrible speakers. I know this laptop comes at a discount price but dang, these 2 things caused me to put it on a popular auction site. I have owned a Sager, Lenovo, 2 MSIsâ?and this Dell. The Dell was by far the mostly cheaply made of them all.My personal recommendation is to avoid this laptop and spend a tad more for a better built laptop. Even a used or refurbished one on an auction site. The performance is good but the quality is not. Just my 2 cents.
1 star is a bad rating and should only be reserved for garbage. I am sorry to say that is exactly what Dell is. This is the first product I have bought from them and within 6 months of purchase, the speakers/audio card is defective. After contacting servicing and sending the product into the repair center they return the product without testing the speakers which continue to show the defect. Throughout the servicing process, there was no contact other than updates and those were too few only mentioning what was done such as arrival, diagnosis, and shipping, Nothing was known about their diagnosis until after the shipping.This should tell you that Dell is absolute trash and if you value your money pay for another product. The laptop seems incredible boasting the new GPU, SSD/HDD hybrid, I7, and 16 GB RAM. These are all a scapegoat for a shoddy product masquerading as an incredible deal. If you value your money at all buy anything else. Prior to this, I had an HP laptop that lasted over 6 years and is still running, and most laptops should not have this problem within 6 months of purchase.
The specs are great and the computer runs smoothly for most applications & games.The problem is that the Anti-Glare display is too bright and blue, and very poor quality! Especially if you have light sensitivity, don't go for it!
Excelente producto 100 % Best Perfomance0 % Errors
Nice item and work hard.
The processing speed is great for games but the charging port is less than desired. I tried to power it on and it wouldnât turn on. It only worked when I blew into the charging port and my son had only had it since Christmas of 2017.
Well, I thought Intel core i7 is better for gaming.But 7th Generation Intel Core i5 is more efficient.1 TB of the hard drive has ample space to store games.Every high-end game runs smoothly on GeForce GTX 1050.8 GB RAM does not allow the system to lag.Windows is far better than iOs. Go for it.Use code to get discount on purchase. Go to:bit.do/ amazon-store
good thin gaming laptop
Please do not get this laptop. It was working fine for the first month. Afterward, the i5 and the 1TB with 8GB of ram just can't keep up with even just Overwatch. It's terrible for this price. Do not get it.
Awesome laptop but 2 week after I got it, the laptop stop charging
I died, and I mean DIED in three days of use. Never seen something like that before. It literally will not turn on, just flashes a gray screen on and off indefinitely.
worst ever computer i have bought.
Great computer for the price. I couldn't be happier. The product information is wrong. This did not come with the promised IPS panel. It came with a TN panel. I'm not upset because it is what I expected. I contacted a few sellers before the purchase to verify. None of them could confirm an IPS panel just "15-inch FHD display". The one answered question above that states it is an "IPS" is from a seller that is selling a $999 model. To be honest the TN panel is great. There are a lot of screen snobs out there that just drool over the the letters IPS. In reality, the screen is fine. Don't stick your nose up to this unless you are some kind of graphic designer and truly need the "IPS" screen. I use this machine for programming, gaming, and media consumption and it works great. Also if anyone is interested, I purchased from coldriver20 and received a pristine product.
Gaming machines are Windows computers that actually work. This is a very solid, sleek, fast laptop.Pros:- Fast i5 enhanced by a dedicated Nvidia 1050 GPU to take some load off. The i5 in this machine benchmarks at 80% of the speed of an i7 @ 3.30GHz using CPU-Z in single threaded mode, but in mult-ithreaded mode the i7 is over 10x faster. Some of that difference could be the laptop is running single channel memory from a single 8GB SODIMM, instead of a matched set of RAM cards in most desktops. In real world use, Windows 10 is such a pig and so slow anyway, that installing a single, larger, cheaper SODIMM is the smart choice for overall performance, because having more slower memory is faster than having less faster memory. But adding a second, matched 8GB 2400 SODIMM to bring the machine up to 16GB would likely speed up the machine some.- I think the design is gorgeous: simple, reasonably thin, very rigid- GREAT GREAT GREAT front facing speakers, for a laptop. Spacious stereo imaging and the laptop actually gets loud. There is even a little bit of genuine bass. A lot better than low end external speakers, and on par with a Beats Pill.- Keyboard has a nice feel, and the backlighting is just right. There's a little light bleed from around the keys that is inconsistently bright when viewed from a low angle, but overall the backlighting is good.- The IPS screen is impressively bright and sharp, but it is not nearly as colorful as my Dell Ultrasharp2913UW when attached as an external monitor (photo comparisons attached). Note: the external monitor in the photos is being driven by the Nvidia chips and the laptop screen is being driven by the Intel chips, which might have some impact on color quality. Yes, the color of the laptop screen is inferior to a pricey external monitor, but it definitely looks better than 90% of laptops out there, and it is an IPS unit, not a TN. Based on the poor screen reviews here, I thought this came with a TN screen so I bought a third party IPS screen model # AU OPTRONICS B156HAN01.1. The replacement IPS screen was slightly less vibrant and less colorful than the Dell, plus it suffers from much worse light bleed near the corners and has two very annoying hot pixels right in the middle. Both screens are AMAZINGLY sharp, much sharper even than my Dell 2913UW, but also a lot smaller with the same 1080 vertical resolution. So the other reviewers are wrong, new Dell 7567s DO come with an IPS screen--confirmed. The attached photo that is missing the laptop's screen bezel (white wiring exposed) shows the OPTRONICS B156HAN01.1 screen--the color and brightness is no better and the Dell's IPS screen, maybe worse.- Three USB 3.0 ports- Dell's great 7Amp external power supply.- Not too heavy and feels solid.- Supports a 4K second monitor. The 1050 drives the second monitor by default to provide excellent gaming speed and video editing power.- One screw, easy access to the RAM and HDD/SSD bays. Awesome!Cons:- The Dell 5000 has the almost the same specs for $100 less, except the great gaming case and speakers, but that i5 is a gen behind and the screen is lower res.- Dell screwed up the bios settings, making the exellent Samsung 960 M.2 Nvme SSDs incompatible at the motherboard level. Depite the horror stories, I gave it a go anyway. The Samsung SSD slides right into the empty slot (my config came only with a 1TB HDD). Once installed and unformated, the Dell sees it right away, so cloning the existing HDD boot patitition to the SSD is a breeze. But once formatted, the SSD disappears. The trick was to return the BIOS to it's default settings. There is another option to return to "factory" settings---dont pick that one. Now the Samsung M.2 SSD works great. Boot time dropped from 39 secs to 19 secs.- The motherboard treats an advanced SSD as a basic SATAdevice, so Samsung's free Magician software has none of the advanced, high speed features enabled. Bummer.- The included 5400RPM mechanical harddrive is slow and it slows the whole machine to a chug. I wouldn't even consider using this machine with Windows running off that hard drive--way too slow.Overall Conclusions:- Adding an 250GB SSD then cloning it to be your boot drive adds $150 but makes a huge difference running all applications under Windows 10.- The cheaper i5 is very competitive with the i7 in single threaded mode (productivity applications) but is only 9% as fast in multi threaded mode.So if you are buying this gaming laptop because the usual productivity-focused laptops are generally garbage, go for it. If you are actually buying this for gaming, I would DEFINITELY spring for the i7 version, since it has an Nvidia 1050 ti instead of base 1050, has 10x faster multi-threaded CPU performance, and it comes with more RAM and a small SSD as standard. That said, if the SSD uses the 2.5 inch drive bay, you're going to have to remove it for more storage and buy an m.2 SSD.Overall, this is a really great and satisfying laptop and I'm glad I bought it.
Laptop arrived working well. Only issue was the speakers quality, but i tend to use headphones anyway.I had to get a laptop cooler because the computer heated up a lot when playing games. The laptop is very sturdy and the keyboard is great! I've been playing StarCraft II on it and running Adobe Illustrator.I did have a problem with it . After a month it became slow and the games froze up. I had tried using dell support assist and it seemed to make things worse, then a after a long windows update everything on the computer was erased and the desktop wasn't functioning at all. No menus would come up and it couldn't connect online.Dell customer support wasn't helpful (the free warranty only covers hardware issues, software help cost $250) , but I did a factory reset, cleaned registries, defragged, and some other things. I basically ended up fixing the computer myself and advice from a friend. Also I removed Dell Support Assist programs (the computer was working ok until I used it. I did some research and found that support assist is known for slowing down computers. There were 4 or 5 programs that were support assist).Ended up returning it. I need something reliable.
This is an excellent laptop for the money. If you are in need of a gaming laptop at a budget price without it looking too shouty when you take it to class or work, this fits the bill nicely. While the majority of the models out there had TN displays, I lucked out and got the updated IPS unit. The display is crisp and vibrant with great viewing angles. The battery life is fantastic as well for a gaming laptop. During every day work such as web browsing and video viewing I get about 6-7 hours (1.5 - 2 hours while playing games using the Nvidia 1050). It also maintains a relatively slim form factor for what is packed in it. The plastic body and build quality feel excellent and the rubberized finish on the top and sides is a nice touch and helps you hold on it it. The downside is that being all black with this texture makes it a fingerprint magnet. The speakers are surprisingly great. The best I have experienced on any laptop I have owned. The sub woofer gives audio extra depth and punch with the front facing speakers providing great stereo sound. One thing to keep in mind is that the speakers are highly directional, so if you are setting at off angles some of the stereo effect is lost. Some people complained about touchpad issues, but this was rectified by a quick and easy Dell drive update. I bought the SSHD model which really slogged the whole thing down. I would immediately recommend getting the model with the SSD. I placed the 500gb SSD from my previous laptop in it and now it is lightning fast. The gaming performance is solid with most games on high settings at 1080p running at 45-60 fps depending on the title. Overall I think this is the best laptop I have owned thus far. There may be more powerful options out there but the price vs. performance ratio on this cannot be beat.Pros:-Great bang for the buck (mine was $700)-Sturdy build quality-Contemporary looks-Easy to work on and upgrade (8gb model has an open ram slot, mine has an open m.2 slot, only takes one screw to get in the back)-Good IPS panel-Great thermals, does get loud er under full load but not much more than my desktop. When not under load and with an SSD it is silent-Nice keyboard back light-Great battery life-Great speakersCons-Keys on the keyboard could be slightly bigger. I adjusted quickly but not as nice as my old Lenovo-Stock mechanical 5400rpm SSHD is a sloth-Fingerprint magnet
Well, this laptop was an awesome gift for our son for the first two months we owned it. Today, hard drive failure. It's outside of the seller's warranty period, so now we're having to deal with Dell for repair. And we're seeing stories from other purchasers on various websites that the "repaired" laptops are having further issues down the line.It might be wise to purchase a different make and model.UPDATE: Now we can see evidence that this unit was previously serviced by Dell. We were sold a used or refurbished laptop that was represented as new.
Purchased this laptop for my daughter whoâs a gamer and she loves it! The graphics and speed are impressive as was the affordable price tag! Highly recommended, you wonât be disappointed!
Honestly,It's totally a steal - to get all these features for such a price. If not for the issues I have faced - which I think is only with the laptop that I've received and not to every laptop, I would totally recommend it.Not sure if 3 stars would be a correct rating to this product. I haven't used it much, and I personally might have got a damaged product but - these are the couple of issues I have faced with this Laptop and Dell.1. Whenever I play a video online or offline, I get a crackling sound, not continuous though. Usually, it lasts for like 2-3 seconds and then audio will be clear again.2. It's not even two weeks and I see some vertical lines as if the display is already damaged. But I'm sure that this product hasn't had any damage after reaching me. All the time it was the only desk and there no way it could get damaged staying on my study desk. These lines are vertical and are only on left half of the screen. These are also not persistent. They just appear for like 1 second and disappear. More often than this I see horizonatal lines appearing for a split of a second.3. I haven't really explored this laptop a lot, but I couldn't even play FIFA 17 on this without any disturbances, I just pauses for a while and then I had to minimize it and then open it again to play. Although the name suggest its a GAMING Edition.I'm quite disappointed to see all these issues come up in like 2 weeks of time. But I am glad that this happened in like the first month itself, so now I can return this thing without losing any money.And with the Dell Customer care, I hoped that they would help me get through this. I was on the call with them for HOURS, they tried installing some drivers and all was in fail. It didn't and I also have to attend another call from them, hopefully, it doesn't take hours again. I am gonna attend that other call scheduled on Monday and decide on returning this laptop to Amazon.
This computer has DIED after one day of use. Not even a day. Maybe two hours. It froze, made a weird noise, and now itâs dead. Luckily dell support said they will fix it but I have to send it in and it would be two weeks.I have lost a lot of trust in this computer.
I've had other gaming lap tops. This is better than my others. -- not a "OMG' but very good.
I got this laptop last Friday and I'm going to return it back tomorrow. This is THE WORST gaming laptop you can have.Almost every one of them has motherboard issues due to BIOS settings that Dell IS NOT WILLING TO SOLVE SINCE LAST YEAR. My laptop started to shut down alone without reason after one hour of use and sometimes it simply doesn't turn it on and I have to let it rest for 2 or 3 hours. I tried to play Overwatch in it and after 30 seconds entering the game it shut down. Every single time I tried the machine turns on sends me to BIOS config and sometimes it decides to not recognize the SSD.Please, don't bother buying this, you're going to regret it and you're going to waste a lot of time. If you don't believe me check Dell's forums. There are hundreds and hundreds of these machines that don't work or have a lot of issues that any new or used-like new machine should have.
Basically bought it. It worked fine the first week then when I shut down It was going to a blue screen every single time which I would have to constantly restart and restart to get it to work. Noticed that fans had alot of dust in them like it was used beforehand. Its been freezing randomly in games and just randomly freezes in general.
Very happy with this purchase. It did blue screen when trying to startup for the first time. I had to research the problem and install a network patch using a USB flashdrive. It was easy to do, but don't buy this unless you know some basics about patching Windows. Once that was done it has been a dream. Plays most modern games on Med-High settings. My son even stepped on the screen one day and bent it into a U shape. I flipped out, but when I looked at it, the screen just bent right back like nothing had happened. I was shocked. So pleased with this purchase.
I would prefer to forward zero stars, but Amazon's rating system would preclude me from doing so. I received this computer with internal hardware damage. This was a tremendous disappointment and a complete waste of my valuable time.
I am giving it two stars, first because the laptop was overall a very good value and the dedicated 4GB video RAM was good enough to play Far Cry 5 on medium settings. However the screen died on me only after 2 weeks of very mild use. Luckily I was able to get a full refund with Amazon. However, as my experience has been with prior Dell laptops, it is very important to have a good warranty and be prepared for periods between shipping and repairing that can take a couple weeks.
More than what I expected. My last Dell didnât last long but I did get it at Walmart. This computer is beatiful, easy to work through, even with the new Windowsð, and it has handled every program and game I have played on it. Worth the money.
I've been using thisnfor a few weeks and it is a very good value for the money. If you need to gaming on the go, this will definitely work.It's not the top of the line and don't expect that by any means. It gets the job done and it does it very well.
Got this laptop on Friday and itâs amazing!!! I know some people saying it runs slow or somthing but being a computer person I kne you have to do all updates and proper set up for laptops to use full potential. And I will tell you it meets all marks. Gaming is smooth and most games like Overwatch can run mid to high settings. And simple MMORPGs is will run smoother than ever for you.
A great product and entry level laptop.I purchased this laptop for myself as a graduation gift. I was torn between this one and the Acer Predator Helios 300.The reason I went with this laptop over the Acer is not only because of the price (purchased for roughly $400 less than the Acer), but because of its versatility. While this is marketed as a âgaming laptopâ?it really doesnât give off that vibe. Sure, it has some of the trademark gamer red accents on it (Dell logo, keyboard + backlighting) and a few smaller discreet accents (heatsinks and the front grill), it doesnât scream gaming like the Acer. It looks like a normal everyday laptop, and Iâve received plenty of compliments on it.PROS:The combination of the Intel i5 7567 and NVIDIA GTX 1050 included makes running programs a breeze. Games run well and smooth:Dark Souls III (highest settings): 50-60fpsRocket League (highest settings): 55-60fpsBioshock Remastered (highest settings) 55-60fpsThe 15.6-inch screen is crisp. Itâs not the brightest, but the model I received is an IPS panel with sharp colors. Itâs also matte, so if that matters to you, there you go.Only one screw to release the bottom cover.Expandable memory slot (M.2 NVME SSD), and expandable RAM.The speakers are loud and clear.The battery is good. Should last at least 2-3 hours with medium gaming, but only about an hour or so doing some heavy gaming (Dark Souls, etc).CONS:The fans can get a bit noisy under load.While the laptop generally runs pretty cool, there are some hotspots on the keyboard (specifically near the WASD keys). It wonât melt your fingertips off, but it can get uncomfortable.The included 1TB 5400rpm hard drive is a bit sluggish. Luckily, this laptop includes an M.2 NVME SSD slot, which can be used to clone windows onto. I purchased a 275GB M.2 NVME SSD, cloned windows onto it, and now it boots up in less than 10 seconds. This can be a bit tricky, but I highly recommend it.There are 3 USB ports, and all of them are 2.0. A shame, but not a deal breaker.Overall, this laptop is great for some entry level gaming and productivity. One big reason I knocked a star off is because the battery/internals cover on the bottom of the laptop broke (the little tabs around the edges snapped off while reattaching it). Not a big issue, as Dell sent me a replacement, but charged me $21.99 for a used one.
So far this laptop has exceeded expectation. It gives my desktop a run for it's money with games. I haven't tested the multitasking of the laptop yet though
Price was perfect, my oldest has been wanting a Gaming laptop and he hand picked this one to fill his needs, I now have a very happy son. It shipped and arrived very fast. It was also $130 cheaper than the exact same one in Best Buy
Purchased this for a friend, he has had not issues, and it runs great.
Amazing customer service, great laptop with amazing specs for it's price. the reviews were wrong about the TN panel and it's actually IPS. the quality is great and i can run games with 60+ fps at max settings. i got 150 fps on league of legends and i couldnt tell the exact fps on overwatch, but it was VERY smooth and it should be more than enough for gaming. the only issue i have is the noise of the cooling fan, but it was expected and it isnt noticable when you wear headphones.
Easy setup. Computer looks heart runs fast the only down side is how can a gaming computer not have a disk drive? This right no disk drive. If you need one you might want to order one if you need it.
My son loves his new computer. He loves the look and feel of it. He is a gaming college student, so his computer must be able to do it all. Seems like he is one happy camper.
Amazing laptop so far! Easy customizability with 1 screw to open the back. 2 slots for the HDD and SSD. Was able to add a SSD to speed up boot time and application load time.Durable feel, not flimsy. Great look and design. Fast. overall Amazing!
PC was working fine until latest Windows update caused it to no longer boot properly. I have found that it is missing the standard recovery partition for cases such as this. Dell Support also shows that the warranty expired on April 30, 2018 despite only having purchased this in February 2018. I would not recommend purchasing from this seller.
Hardware is nice, battery life is decent, doesn't get too hot. Addition of a subwoofer is nice, surprisingly full ranged speakers. MaxxAudio is annoying and useless, and like many reviews state, the screen has bad vertical viewing angles. More USB ports would be nice, but included I/O and Bluetooth fill out their roles.
gets fingerprints easily on case, but besides that, fantastic pc. little bloatware, light for size, cool looking
Great gaming laptop for the price, works great.
I'm happy with it now but when I received it the os had corrupted files and wasn't working properly, I ended up formatting the drive and doing a clean install of win 10 with a win 10 media flash drive and reinstalling all the driver's to get it running smoothly.
Awesome laptop. Will run most 2018 AAA titles 1080p medium to high setting anywhere from 45 to over 60 FPS. Wouldâve loved to find the model with the 1050ti but the 4 gig 1050 is plenty for butter smooth 1080p gaming. Do yourself a favor and buy an M.2 and youâll have a future proof beast for a great price.
Amazing gaming laptop, can run anything I throw at it(:
Love the fan that sucks air from the back and blows out front. Great looks
Great laptop. Fast, good sound, plenty of storage, good with games and work. Battery life is good too.
3 months old and hard drive failed. In the middle of engineering degree and have to wait 5-7 business days to have them repair and still lose my files. Iâll be pursuing another avenue
This laptop performs way above its price point for only $700 you're getting a gtx 1050 which runs most games. If you were to build a pc with the same specs it would cost you about $600. This is a budget gaming laptop that is way above expectations.
We thought we were purchasing a new computer. Hard drive and software was so old it was would not update correctly and was not compatible with the computer. We could not get it to work correctly.
Over 60 fps on almost all games with high and max settings, by the way it comes with TN panel not IPS ,it's not always true that TN panel is bad because TN panel has better refresh rate during gaming. Had great experience so far loving it!
My son love this computer came on time very fast processor
Being a console gamer all my life I finally wanted to try some PC gaming. After researching over 7 laptops for a month I finally found this one. I had to research what graphics cards and cores and processors were. So yea I'm a noob lol. It after owning this for almost a month now I can say it is the best PC I've ever had. It's fast and plays games really well. Have not had any issues. Yes the screen is a TN panel so it's matte instead of glossy, however it's still really good and worth the price. Overall great product and especially if your new to pc gaming like me.
Worked ok long enough for it to go through all of the updates. 30 minutes into a game the screen went black. Sending it back.
was a cool little laptop but mine was defective left speaker rattled either probably was not sautered in right or was blown returned it refund was quick and painless which was good
By looks itâs good but when I turned it on it took 2 min to start. Also it got stuck on process at 92% for almost an hour. Then I decided I made a mistake to buy
It's a pretty good laptop, I can play total war Warhammer on ultra setting, so it works pretty well for gaming. Maybe not top of the line,but I've had worse.
Computer is nice and works well, however the charger in the box didn't work at all so I had to pay for a new one. Also the corners of it dig into my arms.
Please don't buy this laptop. It's incredibly slow and unresponsive. It's definitely not worth $700. Spend $300 more and get a good laptop.
Excellent choice. I like this laptop. It has a cool design.It is just what I needed.
worked as described, great product. Works for all my gaming needs.
Sweet and Simple --There is nothing I don't like about this LapTop There are no CONS
Great comp, sometimes glitches while playing but thatâs a GTX issue with Blizzard games.
Not worth a one star very slow, lags with powerful gamesbriefly just i wasted my money ):
Starting window is quite low but for gaming, this laptop is a beast. The Panel is just fine. Love it.
Honestly, I love this device and the speed and clarity of the screen is excellent and of course good for home and not for mobility.
Super gaming computer!
Great for fortnite and overwatch
Buena calidad y un excelente precio.
Great pc can handle a vast amount of games
No complaints
Great product fast delivery!!
it performs just well as I wanted
This was advertised as new but came as open box, used computer. Had to manually wipe it back to factory settings as we weren't "MEL". And Mel lost part of his bluetooth wireless mouse too.
This thing is a piece of junk I didn't have it 3 days and I was getting booting errors and error reports I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS LABTOP TO MY WORST ENEMY
Shipped out next day and FedEx overnight. Got it instantly and exactly as described. Very happy with the purchase. Computer works great!
Now this is the worst purchase Iâve ever gotten. I donât care if your a rapist or a murderer you donât deserve a computer this bad. Itâs slow af and canât even run fortnite correctly. If I were you I would just keep scrolling on and never click on this computer again.
Junk the unit failed to turn on right out of the box. Nothing but refurbished junk being passed on as good new merchandise. Amazon sucks
Product came faulty. Was unable to use the computer because of a faulty OS. Also bought the one day delivery and didn't get it on the guaranteed day. After hours on the phone will dell, they told me that I need to send in it to the drive replaced. Won't be back for 3 week. Very disappointed, if there was a way to give zero stars I would.
Great laptop should have bought this sooner
Great machine my grandson loves it!!
Very good!!!!!
Arrived earlier than expected, the core i5 and GTX 1050 are a more than capable pairing. If all you want to do is play games like rocket league, csgo, league of legends, etc this will get the job done. Its not the best monitor in the world,(what did you really expect though) however It does have an HDMI port so you can find yourself a bigger and brighter monitor to hook it up to. The SSD is a bit slow but a couple screws underneath will let you have access to the internals where you can make your upgrades should your desire to. It's not overly big or bulky, it's pretty much perfect at least for me.
Headphone ports needed to be updated. The memory is low and it takes forever 5o have games downloaded on steam. The graphics are great but you really need a laptop cooler to keep it from over heating.
So far so good.. Good looking laptop for the price too..
Absolutely great laptop for the price. Can't argue with it at all
Was supposed to be solid state but received HDD instead bummer
I just BOUGHT ONE this saturdayAND IT WONT WORK! Says my HARD DRIVE ITS NOT INSTALLED! Help i need support. Where can i contacte somebody for help!? Cant beleive this its hapening.
Good good
Had to re-install Windows multiple times after multiple failed efforts (through no fault of my own. Computer kept shutting down mid-install). Once finally installed, I spent 2 hours with Dell tech support to determine why the system crashed within 2 minutes of opening an internet browser. After troubleshooting this problem, I come to find that the HDMI port does not work. This machine is worthless....
The biggest POS out there.. crashed since day one and not a single thing has fixed it. Factory resets, countless hours spent making sure each driver is updated and working.. don't buy and won't ever buy a Dell again, and definitely not from these guys.
I purchased this laptop to run CAD/CAM software on because of the need that an above average video card. I was out of the box, setup, and running in about 30 minutes. After an hour of use it hit a blue screen error and shit down. This repeated itself another 8 or 10 times. About 16 hours later, the next morning, I called Dell support and they told me they needed to reinstall the OS and that a clean wipe was required. Itâs now 4 hours later and the reset has been stuck at 41% for 2 hours.I should have known better than to buy Dell. A few years ago my wife bought a dell product that also kept shutting down. We sent it back to them a half dozen times just to have the problem return. After a year the warranty expires and they wanted us to start paying to fix a problem they failed to repair.My suggestion to anyone considering the purchase of a Dell product, keep shopping!
It stop working
Awful screen
Bought one for my son on Christmas, he really loves it. A Great Laptop!
Wanted to give it 5.. I really did.. Backlit keys slick exterior... Great sound. Great performance in games for a 1050 but it freezes so much... I don't know why I checked hard drive and it's not dead.. Something is defective.
I'm really disappointed with this computer it wouldn't even turn on and I called dell support and they wanted to charge me an extra $65 dollars just to fix it
Don't get anything made my Dell for gaming. Just a bad move
As a gaming pc this thing is garbage. Itâs contently freezing. The sound is awful. But on the bright side it likes to stay up to date no matter what you are doing....if the updates work
Bought this as a Christmas gift. My girlfriend loves it. Fast boot up and easy set up. Graphics are amazing and its pretty fast with zero lag. Would give it 5 stars but it doesn't have touch screen. Otherwise a nice and very lite laptop.
This laptop is kind of a dinosaur, old and slow, but it does what I want. I bought it to watch movies from DVDs and programs from my DVR.I have a comfortable lounge chair and a computer stand that fits it just right. I can lie back and watch my programs very comfortably.
Great bargain on a black Friday. picture clear and easy to use. Priced right and large screen for movies
COMPUTER IS BEAUTIFUL WITH ALL ITS MANY FEATURES. DIFFICULT TO LEARN IF NOT FAMILIAR WITH WINDOW'S 10. WE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THE BACKLIT KEY'S AT FIRST. VERY HIGH QUALITY. ALONG WITH IT'S PRICE.
I love this laptop. I got it mainly for school, but my teenage daughter likes it for gaming. Have had a few months, with daily use. No issues whatsoever. Fast, lightweight, and reliable. The backlit keyboard makes it easier to do homework after the kids have gone to bed.
Bought two for our homeschooled kids. They work great and the screens are big.
Love, love so fast.... push the power button and within a minute it's up and running. Nice laptop for the $$
I hate this thing..... I should have bought a DELL!!!! Had it 2 or 3 months and it has stoped work I working now... Just a spinning wheel of dots..... POS
I bought this for my husband because his other computer crapped out and he needed it for some schooling things he was doing. Itâs way bigger then I was expecting.
*Fast delivery*Laptop is lightweight*Beautiful color screen/ laptop design*Back light feature works- use F5*Screen size is accommodating* I am a user of Windows 10 so the updates ran smoothly
All the ports are on the left as if it was designed for a left-handed person and there are only two USB ports. The earphone port does not work. The sound coming out is lower than the speaker from the laptop. I regret my purchase.
Great laptop!! Love it.
It runs smooth,sleek design and 17"screen is nice easy for viewing.
Love it. Pretty fast. And nice backlit keyboard. Not sure what these other reviews are talkin about.
I wish I had ordered one with a backlit keyboard. I saw one after I ordered this one.This computer is fine, it's just that I had so much trouble setting it up with Windows 10. I had to have professional help. My good friend who has been our "go to guy" for computer help couldn't set it up either. Had I realized how unmanageable Windows 10 has become I would have purchased a Mac and been done with this horrid program. I still hate it.
I only have this computer for 15 days, so far It's a very good computer. I love it. I was expiriencing somo problems and just asked for assitance from HP by chat, and they helped me to download all the applications I need. I remember that in some place I read that usually all the new computers are only with the basics and that is needed to update some programs to garantie a better performance. So far is working as good as I need.
Idk what's going on but it said it needed to restart and perform updates. This was only the second time even using the computer and it's had this screen for 3 days "getting windows ready don't turn off your computer" there is no way to get off of that screen. I've turned the computer off....I've control alt delete and esc. I'm really disappointed
The PC does not have a backlit keyboard as advertised
What you get what you paid.
I had the opposite experience to the other reviewer. It was super slow to come on and set up, and the voice that comes on to talk you through setup was out of sync with what was on screen and sort of faded in and out in volume. I thought maybe after the setup the computer would work properly and that maybe the first time it was slow for some reason. It worked only once. The next day when I turned it on it took a while before a picture came on the screen, then I clicked and got the login screen and put a pin in after which the screen went blank for 10 minutes, then switched off. I can't remember whether it came back on by itself or whether I turned it on, but there was another blank screen for 10 minutes. Then a photo came on and sat there for awhile. Eventually a few icons appeared, accompanied by a spinning blue circle that went on and on and wouldn't stop. I was never able to use the computer beyond that first time and have had to return it. There is something seriously wrong with this for this to happen right out of the box. Separately and together with my husband we've had several laptops and have never had this experience. After the other review I was excited about getting it, but I'm afraid to trust another after this experience. I'd been looking for quite a while before I chose this one, and now I don't know what I'm going to do.
Least expensive A12 that I found; good performance for price; not withstanding Win10 is, well, what it is...it ain't Linux. Easily can add Open Source everything so not married to Redmond. Figure out UE bootloader and will dual boot Linux and really use the12 core threading and 64 bit cap. Also cannot just "add" memory DDMs: only one socket means you must remove the 8gb and purchace a 16gb (~$180 further investment); battery not gonna last several hrs, looking at ~2-4. Spend more if like, but overall, for the price, out the door, not bad.
Good for gaming but if your going to do heavy gaming will be a bit of a issue. But overall a good laptop for productivity. Good laptop thank you.
At a "black friday" price, this computers specs could not be beat for the value to dollar performance ratio. The only downside of this computer is its battery life which is reasonable at 3 hours and to be expected with a laptop with these specifications. Runs First person shooters relatively well. Have only tested older games so far like Medal of Honor allied assault but also tested modern warfare 4 and it performed spectacularly. The fans did not turn on loudly if at all.
Runs like a dream! Seller exchanged very quickly when the first one arrived with soy sauce (yes soy sauce) soaked through the box. It was an unfortunate UPS truck mishap. Someone elseâs delivery on my route had a giftbasket that exploded, all over the truck and mostly on my laptop box. Within days it was rectified and Iâm very happy with this laptop. Fast, great graphics and perfect for everyone in my household. From homework, to video editing, to gaming, to Netflix, to online shopping.
Bought a Leno a for myself. Really like it. So I bought this one for my parents.
One of the reasons I bought this computer was that it said it had good wifi connectivity - total rubbish, it dumps me from my wifi connection many times a day and I am totally annoyed and I think it doesn't deserve any stars. My friend said Lenovo was a good company - more rubbish - I did a search for information on wifi issues and Lenovo and there are lots of pages about how this has been their issue for years - yes they give you some things to try to see if they help, but why can't they fix the problem before they ship the computers to retailers - WHY is it still a problem years later that must be fixed by the buyer!!!! Not good enough. I even bought a realtec wifi extender and had to send it back because the computer wouldn't install it and gave me a message that it is not supported by this computer. The computer I am typing this on has an extender, it is 10 years old and as I watch the signal bars on the new computer fluctuate, they don't move at all on this computer. My 6 year old 11 inch HP doesn't have a signal problem. I wasted my money buying this.
Crippled by awful disk performance. For 10-20 minutes after boot, youâll be like syrup in winter. The disk activity is at 100% for a very long time. Once it settles down, itâs usable but youâll need to be patient. The screen is pretty low resolution, and the keys arenât backlit. Essentially, this is a âburnerâ?laptop. Thatâs how Iâm using it, and thatâs about right given the details- itâs a borderline usable system for an absurdly low price (like $350 or so).
Its decent. Worth the money. Could have had a better quality for the price but its adequate. Its a bit slow/glitchy when opening certain apps or windows which can be annoying but fast enough to do what i need it to with no major problems. I like the look as a whole and like the feel of the keyboard for the price. Dont like the feel of the mousepad or the mousepads left and right click. They suck. But i use a seperate mouse so no biggy. Its relatively quiet but not all the time. Battery life isnt as great as expected but its good enough for the price i suppose. Its lightwieght for its size so thats good. I like most everything about it but i dont love it. Id change a few things and add about 50 bucks to the price but thats just a personal preference/opinion. As far a laptops go, its a good computer for a price that wont break you. It does what i need it to do, and then some, with minor annoyances here and there but not to the point of it being something that would cause me to not recommend it. If you can find better for the same price or maybe just a little pricier, go for it. Im just glad to have a modern, working pc. Thanks.
Bought this for my ten year old for school and creating. She loves it! I would buy this for myself as well. I wish the camera was a little better, but it's great otherwise.
I liked the fact that Lenovo came with the Microsoft programs on it. The only problem that I have found about Lenovo is that it comes with a program called MIGRATION, which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer. However, I used it the wrong way and wound up deleting the Microsoft programs as it went from Lenovo to my old computer. Watch out for that!
This is nice for the price and has good speed.
It was slow probably due to using AMD but it had HDD defects and I had to return it. It might have worked out of it wasn't damaged. Tough to know.
Runs great - however, I just tried to upload my small adventure videos and the built in video player stops mid video about 10 seconds in - audio continues. Any idea on what this may be?
This laptop is fast and does what I need without problems. My only issue is that the fan is very noisy and gets stuck at times, causing worry about the laptop getting overheated.
Bought this for web surfing at home. Works well and is much faster than my HP laptop.
Great Product and Price
I bought this for a Christmas present 2017 and it has stop working in March of 2018. Do not purchase this
Amazing laptop! I've always bought hp for my work laptop and built my own desktops. This laptop is the best of both worlds
The battery is bad
love it. best Xmas present to myself after my HP laptop broke on me.
Works very well. About what I was expecting/hoping it to be. My only fair complaint is that it occasionally restarts itself without warning (usually no more than once every day or two). It is a little slow at times though.
It is very good for the price.
Will not boot up after only having it for 3 months. Called Lenovo and they want me to pay them to fix it even though its in warranty. Bad product and bad tech support.
Been using showbox and had to wait to buffer.. This has worked great to overcome that problem. Internet browsing super fast. Overall very satisfiedVery fast
Good computer good memory
too slow
For the price itâs good value but as others have stated , the battery life is very low. Youâll be lucky to get a couple hours out of it. Charging takes a while youâd have to keep it plugged in for at least an hour or two to get it fully charged.Iâm assuming the battery wasnât designed to handle the laptop being as though itâs got a quad core processor and good amount of ram. Guess they had to cut the costs somewhere... Lucky for me I donât use it all that much , just got it to do some work when not at the office, less than an hour a day of usage.
love love love this laptop! I use it for work and designing.
The best laptop for its price. I recommend it, definitely
I had a problem connecting my wifi to my laptop.
the machine stopped working......I only get a dark screen.....not functioning at allDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !H.Rojas
Shortly after receiving the laptop it shut off and wouldnât turn back on. Even after getting help from tech support I had no choice but to return the computer.
I have sent it as a present to another country and it turned out that the laptop has fabric defect. After 2 days of use, the paint started to come out on the keyboard, as in the picture. the Battery life is less than 2 hours and it takes three hours to charge it. It is working very noisy, the RAM is getting filled with one ms word file. The seller is awful. First promised to make a discount, then said he can not, then again that he can do it. And has passed already about two-three weeks no news from him. He does not even answer my emails. Very disappointed. Would never buy again LEVONO.
DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!! It runs great for a week, then everything starts breaking. My disk now runs at 100% at all times, no matter what I do. I Frequently lose all sound, then have to run system restore to get the sound back. Even plugged in, the battery slowly drains. Nothing but frustration and annoyance. I work in the PC repair field, so I do know what I am doing, as well as what I am talking about. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!
Keyboard was defective. I'm sending it back.
Good laptop. But the worse webcam I've seen in a while and the battery dies very fast .
seems slow
Laptop meets spec for what it was purchased to do but disappointed it was shipped with a charger not compatible with location it was shipped to ( needed to buy an adapter to convert from 2 pin to 3 pin plug )
If the computer I received from SKYHIGH TECH was a new computer, I would have not had to spend 5hrs to set it back to original factory settings. I was not able to set it ups and log onto it Do to another person had logged in and set a password. I may have had a different opinion if this was truly a new computer as advertised. Amazon buyers beware of SKYHIGH TECH.
I'd have liked a bit more memory and more memory expandablity. The computer will only hold 16gb of total ram. Other than that I'm very happy with the computer
After my last HP laptop died, I purchased this one. So far I have absolutely no complaints. It is much lighter than my old laptop which I really like, as well as being a bit flatter. I would certainly recommend this laptop, even though I've only had it for about 2 months.
Ability to get up and running excellent. But has bloatware to get rid of from factory. Standard startup for HP laptops that I have dealt with.
Great condition thin and lightweight. Some issues with the drivers but HP has provided me the drivers from their site for continues improvements. Overall a fine machine for all your needs.
Performs awesome!
This laptop works okay. What is NOT OKAY is the message from HP telling me that the factory warranty expired three days after I received it. This was not disclosed in the Amazon description and I feel totally ripped off. Brand new computer, no warranty. Any/all stickers have been removed from the bottom of the laptop, so the only place I have a serial number is on the box it came in.. I feel the seller was deceptive in not disclosing this little factoid. HP wants $110 to extend the warranty.
I bought this laptop as my husband's Christmas present. The computer was delivered as promised. Then two days later the Microsoft suite for Home was delivered. When my husband turned on the laptop to begin to load it the Microsoft Suite I had purchase, the laptop locked with a message from Microsoft that the computer had a virus in it and the Microsoft Key was not to be used in this computer. Now, my husband does not have his new laptop for Christmas because we are unable to open it, download a thing, or work with it. Microsoft now wants $400 <> from us to clear the computer. This computer came with this defect and we were not able to even do a thing to it. I also paid with my Discover card the bill which I had over $176.00 in bonus for using my card and if I returned the computer to you this money will disappear! PLEASE TELL ME WHAT AND HOW CAN I FIX THIS PROBLEM. I am a good Amazon Prime customer and have been for many years now.
Can't believe you can't upgrade the memory. Stuck with 6gb. What is this, an apple product? Wouldn't have bought it if I knew this. Can't run Windows Mixed Reality due to insufficient memory. Only saving grace is it comes with a slim profile DVD burner.
I bought this laptop because I started back to college and I needed something portable that was still a good computer. I love just about everything about this laptop. My only negative comment about it is the speakers. They are on the bottom of the laptop. I have to turn the volume almost all the way to the max level just to hear anything. I don't understand why the speakers are under the computer when they could have easily been put above the keyboard. I love the huge screen and I also like the number pad on the keyboard. The only thing that would make this laptop better would be a lit keyboard. I'm satisfied with my purchase because the price really was really good for this caliber of pc.
does what I bought it for. Watching old family films on CD
very slow not really worth the money, I went back to using my very old apple macbook that I still need to update but it still works better than this one.
great price, full feature. weighs more than I though it would
I hate to complain but This computer is way too slow at everything. it is not even faster than my one i bought in 2007 . i just do not like it at all. I would love to find a better one to exchange if possible.
Arrived on time and was just as I expected.
Very nice Computer for the price.
I upgraded to a larger screen to better view pics. This is ok, for the price. Runs a little slow but since I don't really need a faster speed I'm satisfied. All in all a pretty good machine.
I use it for emails and Facebook and Facebook games. The screen is a little flimsy.
Great laptop for the money!! Speed is good!!
top split at hinges an now won't receive WI FI signal. loved it when new
This was the worst purchase I ever made from Amazon.The laptop did not even come with microsoft 10....
Works great!
This was a Christmas present for my brother and he loves it! He says he can't believe how fast it is.
Died four months later .Do not buy this junk
Great product, more than I expected.
Verey happy
This is one of the most complete laptops, with a good form factor, that I have had the pleasure of using. Please note that this is *not* a gaming laptop, though some basic games will run fine. It is a well rounded, very competent entry into the business laptop category and should be a consideration, price wise, for those who might be thinking about dropping 2-3 times as much for a surface laptop.First, the negatives:1) It is all plastic. When I first saw this online, I thought it was metal top at least, if not entirely metal. Nope, etched plastic made to look like brushed aluminum. F-2) It has a DVD in it. What?!??! Did we hop in the DeLorean and ride back to 2007? Totally unnecessary today, as external DVDs are cheap and have a better form factor, plus the space could have been used for 1-2 SSD.3) It ships with 8 gigs of ram, which also is a plus (more on that and check the attached photo).The Positives:1) SHIPS WITH NO BLOAT WARE!!!! HALLELUJAH!2) Windows 10 updates to the Creators Edition as soon as you turn it on.3) Can drive two external monitors at 1920x1080 with ease.4) Keyboard is so-so, a decent size keyboard, but lacks good tactile feel. Call this one even.5) Ships with 8GB ram... IN ONE RAM STICK! YAY!Updating this thing to 16 gigs is a snap. Just remove to the two screws on the back panel and gently slide the panel towards you. You will happily see an empty DDR4 Ram slot for you to put another one in. It is highly recommended you get another 8 gig ddr4 ram chip right away. You will see some improved performance since Double Data Rate 4 chips want to be installed in pairs. From an article..."As was already stated, in order to optimize memory performance so that it operates in "dual channel" mode, you need to have matched pairs of memory sticks installed. If you have just one stick of the required pair your memory will operate in the less-than-optimal "single channel" mode."So, the memory in my Asus is Samsung 8gb PC4-2400T. For optimal memory performance, the chips must have the same timing and latency numbers. I'm going to try to find the specific memory chips and paste a link here... I'm not sure you will get the best performance if you use other chips.Edit: Found it. I did not find the memory chip on Amazon, but did find it on a certain "egg"y other site, of the "new"ish variety. The chip is SAMSUNG NOTEBOOK MEMORY 8G 1Rx8 PC4-2400T-SA1 (8G DDR4 2400), and you can find it directly by googling "Samsung DDR4 M471A1K43881-CRC. I'd do a direct link to the other online retailer, but I understand that through the Amazon EULA everyone agreed to, if I did that Jeff Bezos would get to punch me in the groin. It's true you have to watch what you are agreeing to with those things.
This is probably the best laptop you can purchase in the $500 range; with a few caveats:- The 1TB Hard drive is 5400 RPM, on the slower end of HDDs which means that programs booting up are going to be a bit slower. You can easily upgrade to a 7200 RPM HDD (which would be the baseline/standard) or if your willing to pay for a Solid State Drive obviously that would dramatically boost boot time. I purchased a Seagate 500gb 7200RPM for $40, ghost the OS and files and now use the 1TB as an external drive-Comes with 8gb of RAM but an additional slot is easily accessible on the underside. I immediately popped it open and dropped in a Crucial 8GB DDR4 2400 ($60). 16gb of RAM is plenty and can handle anything your planning on running on this machine. (If your looking to drop more than 16gb you should probably be shopping for a beefier machine overall (i7 processor, GTX 1070, etc)- Intel HD 620 integrated graphics; this model laptop cannot be upgraded with a more robust graphics card however the 620 isn't terrible. Arguably on par with the Nvidia GTX 400/500 series from several years ago, so nothing incredible but certainly usable for older games or non graphics intensive programs. Check out on you tube some benchmark test to see if its acceptable to you.- very little bloatware: seems trivial, but seriously, it can be exhausting researching pre-installed software and going through the uninstall process. I was immensely pleased that this machine had practically none on it.- In summary: a well balanced laptop with room for some easy improvements (you'll easily put between $100 - $150 in upgrades into it, but if search for a laptop that has the features I described already installed your easily look at a $300 increase in price.) If you are someone looking to purchase a new gaming laptop or something for editing picture/ video, you should probably look elsewhere. But if your shopping for a reliable, fast everyday use computer, meant for light gaming, internet surfing, etc. This is the one for you.
Bought this a few weeks ago. Fantastic price for what you're getting. A 7th Generation 7200u CPU and a 1080P monitor? Great deal!This Laptop has built in Bluetooth for up to 7 devices at the same time, even though this product description doesn't state it.Positives:1. Very little bloatware (almost none, really) The ASUS utilities do NOT come pre-installed, they come on a DVD. Updated versions of the apps are also easily acquired via the support website.2. Laptop looks and feels great considering it's a plastic shell and not aluminum. Does not show finger prints, but does show human oil left behind, so have a micro-fiber cloth around sometimes to remove it.3. Fingerprint ID was easy to set up with "Windows Hello" and works every time. (you can download ASUS app (Business Manager) for securing USB port access and create encrypted portions of the hard drive)4. Upgraded to Windows 10 Creators edition, took about 2 hours to install. Cortana understood my questions easily and fast via the mic.5. Power brick is small, and only gets warm to the touch. Basically, as long as you keep the sun off it, will work great regardless of where you put it.6. 1920x1080 screen works great, Intel 620 HD graphics. Can be used to extend desktop to two external monitors via VGA port at 1080P and 4K 2160P via HDMI. Picture attached. It is a matte screen, so don't expect the high glass look of a tablet, definitely low degree of viewing angle for peak contrast. (ASUS has a display app for this PC called "Splendid" you can install from support that lets you customize in detail the screen color). Along with Intel HD Graphics control, works great, attached picture.7. ASUS Remote Link App for Android Google Play that lets you control the computer, mouse, media playlists, powerpoints, sleep, restart, logoff. remotely via wi-fi or bluetooth. Forget to shut off your PC as you leave the office? Open App, shutdown remotely.8. FULL size Keyboard! The keys are full size, with proper gaps between them. People with large fingers won't have any trouble with this layout.9. Battery life! Even on balanced mode, out of the box getting 10 hours (Screen shot included). probably longer on power save mode. The CPU really does throttle its mhz on the fly as needed, I've seen it go from 900 mhz up to 2.7 ghz, but mostly stay around 1.9 ghz when idle.Negatives1. 1 TB 5,400 RPM hard drive really is super slow, 2010 slow, but that's what you should expect. I knew that when i bought it. I will be upgrading to an SSD once a proper sale comes along.2. Not a lot of accessories for this P Series. Would have liked the option to buy a hard drive slot for the CD/DVD slot to add a 2nd hard drive. Maybe even a 2nd battery bay drive. If someone knows a recommendation one, please let me know.3. Why a White ASUS on the lid? Why not black like on the keyboard?4. The speakers are definitely weak. the speakers are located under the chassis and really only give vocal range frequencies, but only can be used in quiet rooms. However, who doesn't have headphones or bluetooth speakers these days? really not a big deal since this is a business laptop.I definitely recommend this laptop, especially for people who love to pick a custom SSD drive upgrade later from their favorite vendor.DVD drive sounds like a small fan on your desk at high speed. If you're watching a DVD without headphones or speakers, I could see it being an issue, but who does that now?
The ASUS P-Series P2540UA-AB51 business standard Laptop is a great laptop on paper. Its packed with a 7th gen i5 processor, a full 1080p matt display and 8gb ram with a 1tb HDD. On Top of this, it is packed with business essential tools that make it not only easy for the individual but for IT as well. It has a fingerprint detector, wake up on LAN and a great, true to spec 9-hour battery.While this is great in terms of specs, when it comes to actually using the device it is a disappointment. One of the major grievances of this laptop is its display. The viewing angles are absolute garbage, and it will quickly darken if your off center when viewing your screen. The dpi is terrible as well, making things look more âpixelatedâ?than they are. It's definitely a lower range 1080p display. Next, there are issues with the keyboard, in my experience, the keyboard is not nearly as responsive as it can be. I am writing this review on this pc, and often it seems like there are missed inputs, and for a laptop that advertises itself as a business-friendly pc, a business pc should have a great keyboard as its likely to be used to write documents.Then there are many other minor issues that cause complications between the software and the hardware of the pc. You will have to do a lot of troubleshooting with this laptop as features will seamlessly disable themselves and break with updates. There are issues with the fingerprint reader, it seems like every time I âfixâ?it, on the next restart it breaks again. This definitely seems like a driver issue that needs to be addressed. Additionally, the touchpad stopped working for me after uninstalling the Office application that comes factory loaded and had to go and get new drivers(Asus gestures) to fix it.Additionally, while this following issue is more of an individual case, my laptop came with a nongenuine version of windows. I had to go through Microsoft and get that issue fix, and that adds on to my displease with this laptop.I bought this laptop for business use, but unfortunately, the experience has left me with a bitter taste. The laptop does have some positive such as its hardware i5 and 8gb of ram, Its 9-hour battery life and average weight for being a 15.6 traditional laptop. Its ease of access to upgrade its HDD and ram, which I, of course, switch its HDD for an SSD. It's a disappointment when utilizing the hardware and it seems much more of a waste when basic things like the screen, keyboard, and touchpad are horrendous. Overall, I personally would not recommend this laptop, while the internals seems great, its executed in such bad matter that makes this laptop a disappointment.
I received it Thursday. Following the instructions, I plugged it in and left it alone to charge. I came home from work Friday so excited to get on my new laptop. I turned it on, it uploaded updates, told it I preferred English and selected Express Config instead of Custom. It didn't take long. Quickly it asked me to log into Microsoft or set up an account. I got half of my email address enter and the screen went black. I can see the mouse, that's it. Left it alone, nothing. Rebooted, nothing. I open the warranty booklet and it says to go to their website for customer support info. Seriously. What if this was my only computer? Luckily, I have a phone I can look it up, but my mother doesn't. What would she do. So I look it up, hoping its an easy fix. One quick phone call and I'm ready to go for the weekend. Woot. But I won't know until next week because their support desk is only open Mon-Fri. Seriously. There is an email address and I can leave a message, which is nice. But how freaking frustrating. If/when I get the computer to function I will update this to a review of the actual product. But since I can't use it, all I can review is a complete lack to contact anyone today about the computer that didn't work basically out of the box.UPDATE: Several hours later it occurred to me to go to their website. Not the one they put in the warranty book, their normal site. I found a live chat there. It took over an hour to get someone, but then it was in fact the simple fix I hoped for. Hard reboot while holding F2. Yay. So, I'm still mildly annoyed by the whole process, but I have a laptop now. For now, I'm sticking with 3 stars because the material they provide in the box for what to do with a problem is WRONG. Don't go to the commercial Asus site. Just go to Asus.com.
Well first impressions it looks good, feels light but came with some problems right off the bat. The computer wouldn't connect to the wifi. I tried the network trouble shooting on windows couldn't detect a problem. It wasn't until I went into the wireless driver settings that I saw that the DHCP was turn off for some reason and wouldn't load some pages. I trouble shooter that and now it works. Overall the setup was easy besides that really fast and is really cool like it doesn't get warm as my previous laptop.
I bought this on Prime Day this year, and 37 days later, the screen took a dump and wouldn't display anything, although it looked as if the computer itself was still working. Contacted Amazon tech support, they arranged for a replacement to be sent to me, even though it was 7 days past the "no questions asked" return period. New one arrived, swapped out the hard drives and moved my memory expansion from the old PC to the new, and I was back in business within half an hour. The unit has given me good service except for that one lone glitch. Hopefully the replacement will last longer than the original unit.
This is my first ASUS computer, and I'm very disappointed not only with the notebook but their customer service. The overall feeling of the notebook is that it's cheap and plasticky. Indeed, it is a cheap computer with cheap components. The fingerprint reader does not work consistently, and the DVD drive stopped working after a few uses. I called ASUS customer service, and they refused to send a replacement drive. Instead, they insisted that I send in the whole unit for repair, which not only doesn't make any sense, but it means that I will be without my laptop for however long it's going to take them to repair it. I believe this is ASUS's way of saying, they don't want to honor their warranty by providing a workable solution. I strongly recommend another brand with a better warranty service, like Dell. They will send replacement components to honor their warranty. The only consolation is that through Amazon's excellent customer service I received a partial credit.
I have been using this computer for 7 months and so far I am beyond pleased with it. The fingerprint scanner has been working flawlessly and is a great alternative to manually entering a password every time. Speed of the computer is very impressive, it is quick and responsive since there is no bloatware loaded. After several months I upgraded the hard drive to a Samsung 500GB SSD. With that upgrade this laptop boots up and loads lightning fast. I have not upgraded the 8gb of memory as of yet but that is forthcoming as I have a tenancy to leave browser windows open in Chrome and that habit utilizes a good amount of memory. I do a light amount of HD video and photo editing and so far the processor and memory has performed well with those task. When utilized on my desk the HDMI is utilized for an external wide screen monitor, so running two screens is not an issue with the graphics card. The 27in monitor I have attached is crisp, clear and responsive.The one flaw that I have with the computer is that with the construction near the memory. When grabbed from the front corner on the left front corner I have had the computer freeze/lock up. The only fix is to force a shutdown when that happens. I have determined that plastic bottom panel covering the memory is pressing into the memory stick which is under the mouse pad and causing it to compress which causes the PC to freeze. I have 4 other ASUS computers (different models) that I use for my business and this is the only one that does this. I just have to be careful when picking it up in the field.Overall a great value and despite its one flaw it is a solid computer that has been holding up well. I would recommend upgrading to an HDD hard drive to boost performance and speed if that is something that is important to you.
When looking for a personal computer that had the processing power, memory, and capability of a $1000 computer for $500, this laptop was an obvious choice for an amazing deal. It is a "business" computer, however, it can be used for any function that you wish, it was just designed with the business person in mind. I am using it for college classes and it works great. There is no nonsense software that comes preloaded, only the expected programs.As the description states, it does come with Windows 10 pre-downloaded. You may get an error message on startup that your Windows version is not activated and receive an error code. DO NOT FREAK OUT. You did not get a pirated version of Windows, all you need to do is update the Windows version in your "Settings" and the error will be resolved and your version of Windows will reflect a registered, legitimate copy. The error has to do with IPv6/IPv4 resolution in communication with the Windows server that pushes updates.This computer is reasonably fast and functional, I have many tabs open and processes running and my characters appear as I type them with no lag whatsoever. The setup is VERY simple, you basically have to plug it in, turn it on, update your Windows version, and download Chrome or Firefox if you so choose and you will be set up. The Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, etc.) is a trial version, so you may have to purchase the software if you need it later on down the road.The only negative aspect of this computer so far is that on the palm rest and touch pad, your hands leave obvious marks from the touch. A simple wipe down solves this, it is a minor complaint.Overall, this is a GREAT laptop for the money you will pay. For an average user, you may never use all of the memory available, and it will be fast enough for your daily browsing, school, or whatever it is you do on your computer. For the more proficient users, upgrading the hard drive or RAM is fairly simple and easy, all it takes is a couple of screws and you are where you need to be.
Why I bought this laptop:I needed to replace a very long in the tooth Dell that sits on my desk and is used intermittently during the day and taken home on the weekends. I don't need a real powerhouse and just need something to do some diagnostics and remote into my desktop from home if needed. I have a few of the Zenbooks deployed and they seem to be quality machines so I am comfortable with ASUS laptops.I knew that I wouldn't be using Windows so the fact this has Windows Home was not an issue. If I were keeping Windows, I would have went with one that had PRO on it already or upgraded to Enterprise. I took the 5400 RPM drive that Windows was installed on and replaced it with an SSD drive. This laptop has easy access to the hard drive and RAM.I installed Ubuntu Gnome 17.04. The peripherals I use (wireless, LAN, display, trackpad, audio) all work. I didn't try to get the fingerprint reader working.Pros:Powerful for price - I5, 8GB RAM, FHDEasy access to replace hard drive and RAMUbuntu works out of box12 month warranty. Pretty standard on electronics. 30 day replacement with Amazon. I haven't required any use of the warranty.Cons:If I were going to be closing and opening the lid multiple times every day, I would worry about the hinge area. It feels like every other sub $500 laptop, but that is what this is.Windows Home on a "PRO" laptop. I didn't use Windows, but I would expect something labeled as pro and for business to have the ability to join a domain out of the box.A con for me is a cdrom drive. That area could have been better utilized as a space for a second storage drive. Most of the cdroms put in laptops are crap that break with any use.I would buy this laptop again for my use case.
Fast boot up. The hard drive is fast enough. Good screen resolution. No pre-installed "extras". The software supplied by ASUS installed poorly and did not seem to add any functionality. Full keyboard is great.
For what my mother uses this for, it is perfect for her. A million times better than that cheap crappy trash HP she used to have (that she now no longer touches). Although I am disappointed in one thing, the right touchpad key tends to stay down either when neither button is clicked for a while or the right button is clicked multiples times consecutively. It's fine once you click the left mouse button once but it can be annoying. Every light indicator is on the front side of the laptop keyboard in a row, where your left wrist is likely to cover it when typing.Edit: It appears the touchpad thing is not uncommon among laptops with that particular type of seamless, full touch touchpad. Mine does it to. Bumped this laptop up to 5 stars. Now I know for the next laptop I get that the physical touch buttons are better as they have never given me problems before. I hope they don't get phased out of gaming laptops anytime soon. This particular laptop is holding up pretty well, I would definitely say it is great for students with every day school work, studying, etc. If you use the touch pad with your right hand, be prepared to reach over a bit farther than usual, I personally don't like that the touchpad is so far to the left but it's nothing much to complain about. Unless you like to play games using WASD+Touch, in which case this is a very irritating setup. I can say nothing about the fingerprint scanner as my mother doesn't use it. Overall I'm so glad I decided to get this laptop for my mom, I almost gave her a touchscreen one from another manufacturer that actually got recalled for defects just a few months later!
Bought this ASUS P-Series to use as my daily driver for work and personal productivity stuff. I have had it for about 2 months now and I am pretty happy with the laptop. I pulled out the HD and replace it with a SSD I was using in my old laptop so I'm getting pretty good response from the laptop. I have a dual monitor setup at work that I was able to continue to use sine there is both a HDMI video and VGA video output ports. The Gen 7 i5 was a nice sweet spot for me. The fit and finish is not supper but for $500 bucks I'm OK with it. I travel everyday back and forth to work with the laptop and as long as you have a decent size bag (I have a large enough messenger bag) you should be good to go. Since this thing is all plastic if you do not have a decent laptop slot in your bag with good cushioning I would suggest you pick up a Laptop sleeve for some extra protection. I made a backup image of Win 10 build it shipped with and reinstalled the machine with Linux Mint, it has been running like a champ no issues. I only have two projects left to finish up my planned changes for the laptop. I will be bumping it up to 16GB of RAM (Not a big deal it comes with a single 8GB dim) you just need to order another 8GB dim and I will be ready to roll. The last change after that is I would like to ditch the included optical drive and install a second internal storage device, maybe even through to 1TB drive it came with back in there (It is a 5400RPM drive, made me sad) Afer that my Frankenstein build will be completed.At $500 it is worth the cash. My only other complaint so far is the plastic case is a bit of a finger print magnet. Not a huge deal I give it a wipe down once a week.
I've been using this computer since about Septer 2017.The 1st computer I received didn't work, so Amazon was cool enough to send me a new one.The 2nd computer I received didn't work, so next, I went through ASUS customer service. I sent it in under warranty, and it was returned to me without the problem fixed. So, I had to send it back a second time. Got it back, it works better.I start installing programs, and it keeps crashing. But, once I restart the computer, it seems to be ok.Well, I was wrong. Programs often stop responding/crash and sometimes it doesn't wake up from sleep mode.I've tried different web browsers, uninstall/reinstall of programs, scanning for viruses, utilizing cloud space for most storage... etc.No good. I'm very frustrated by this computer and regret buying it.Pros: no preloaded junk programs, cd player, lots of ports (such as HDMI), size. I actually like the plastic body. It's easy to clean.other: The sound system is ok. I usually use my headphones anyway.
Everything about this laptop is nice, except the keyboard. I normally type pretty fast, but on this keyboard if I type quickly it drops keys or even transposes keystrokes. Many times the shift key doesn't work. The only way the keyboard works correctly is if I type slowly and deliberately, which is ridiculous. I bought a cheap Amazon Basics USB keyboard and everything is fine now, but the laptop itself is worthless without a functioning keyboard!
Cons:This thing was a piece of junk from Day 1. They ship it with 1 stick of RAM and a 5400 rpm hard drive. The CPU is only a dual core i5 with magical hyper-threading which does absolutely nothing, so the least they could do is split the memory into a 2 stick configuration for dual channel speed. They don't! DDR4 pricing is also inflated beyond belief. Luckily, they paid for the return shipping label because it was probably more expensive than the keyboard and trackpad. I use a USB mouse because the BlueTooth is so cheap, it disables the WiFi when trying to use both at once. The keyboard shows signs of wear within the first 3 months. The machine as it is sold may as well be a DIY kit laptop because it is useless with Windows 10, without a solid state drive and without 16gb or 32gb DDR4 in a 2-stick configuration. This thing is the Netbook That Never Could. Burn it in a fire. Give me my money back and some flammable fluid. I will do it for free and put up a video.Pros:Ubuntu 18.04LTS works perfectly except for the WiFi and BlueTooth problem which exists indefinitely on any operating system. Asus is also losing market share because of these poor decisions. I am selling this piece of garbage when I receive the replacement and buying an MSI laptop instead.
I have been using this Laptop for a week now and I feel it is really good value for money.The packaging was good, the look and feel is great, the 1920x1080p display renders crisp images. The pre loaded Windows 10, though this was something that I did not want, is nevertheless, quite quick to boot up.I have not run any benchmarking tests but don't see any problem with any of the regular applications.The two things that I have a complaint about :1. The mouse pad does not respond the way you want it. I don't know if there are any settings to change the feel, but the default settings leave a lot to be desired.2. The placement of the status LEDs. These are placed in the front edge of the laptop and hence are not visible to you during your normal working position !!! So, to check if the Caps Lock is on, you have to either bend down to look or tilt the laptop up to see the front edge .... What kind of UI design expert decides on these things, I wonder ?!
For the price this is a great laptop. I mainly use this for work, so I'm not using it for anything that would require a lot of processing power, but I have had no issues and it runs quickly and smoothly. Also, it's a good looking laptop and comes with a lot for how little it costs. I would definitely recommend this laptop for anyone that needs a solid computer for work/school.
This is a decent low-end full service laptop. It comes without all the junk you often find on low-ends, so I didn't have to spend a lot of time removing bloatware.This was purchased a basic laptop to use internet, word processing and email primarily. I would not purchase it if your intention is to watch videos or other screen intensive uses. The screen display is subpar compared to others and the refresh rate rather slow. It says 1080p but seems to be less than that.I do like the fingerprint scanner since I was able to enter multiple people and don't have to rely on everyone to remember the PW.In the end, you get what you pay for and this is a good value.
Good computer overall, sleek and fast for me. However I don't know what they used as a "benchmark" to get 9 hours of battery life, I'm lucky if I get 2 and heaven help you if you forget to turn it off before you close the lid. Not a good college computer, needs to be plugged in every other use
Great work computer. I am a salesman and use this constantly in my office and on the go and the battery life is around 9 hours with no issues. As far as speed goes, let me start by saying I'm a PC gamer and if comparing this to my own built PC naturally it would be slower, but even as someone used to using a high end gaming PC everyday this computer has no speed issues. When I first unboxed the computer and turned it on prior to a significant amount of updating it had some laggy moments but as soon as all the updates finished I've not had a problem with it. Great at what it does. Fingerprint reader works well.
Pros:Cheap for performance.Low cost to bring RAM up to 16G with option to go 32G max.Battery life is good.Running Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS doesn't get too hot on my lap (although I haven't stressed it a lot yet).Running Windows 10, fingerprint scanner nice.DVD-RW drive, nice for the old tech in our lives.SD Cart slot for you go pro and other devices that do SD card slots.Display is bright and clear.Cons:Can't judge on this but no keyboard backlight, think more than I did before you make the decision to buy.Also I find that this laptop does tend to show finger print smudges pretty easy.I also don't like where the 0 is on the 10 key.
Pros:- I work in IT and it has all the features you'll need (DVD burner, plenty of USB slots, HDMI, ethernet)- Keyboard is full size and works great- TPM for a little extra security- Works perfectly with Linux (Tried Linux Mint, Fedora, Arch)Cons- It's a bit bulky (probably because of the DVD drive)- Plastic construction- Extremely slow if you don't replace the hard drive with an SSDOther- Fingerprint reader works poorly in Linux but it's a security threat anyway (Works great in Windows)
I wanted to wait a few months before I reviewed this because I've had experience with cheaper laptops being very short lived, so far this one is fine though. I like it quite a lot. It's faster than I was led to believe by other reviews, and yes it could use some more memory but over all there's no problem, at least not so far. I bought it mainly for traveling since I prefer a desktop at home, and have now made 3 trips with it, and it's worked just fine!
What an amazing laptop! I comes with no irritating excess software offers like most all the others. I was able to load QuickBooks and my payroll software on it easily and it just works the way it's supposed to! I absolutely love it. What a great laptop for the money. I have an Asus desktop, so I had high expectations for this laptop and it hasn't disappointed.
This is a great laptop - well worth the price but:- As soon as you receive the laptop pull the damn HDD out and put a SSD into it. Makes an ENORMOUS difference in terms of speed and overall responsiveness of the laptop.- Mine had a motherboard issue - it would randomly glitch and turn off. I sent it into Asus repair and had a good experience with them. They fixed it quickly, quietly and sent it back to me.
Bought this for my son to use in law school, in theory it should be perfect. It was impressive, for the price, and we had reasonable expectations. It began to crash, regularly, right after the second month...it has continued this, to this very day. My son has to bring a âback upâ?computer to exams, because this one will crash, it is just a matter of when. So frustrating and my son needs it...and canât be without it. Customer service has been abysmal. Buyer beware.
Made very nervous to get a non leading laptop. The hard drive is very slow and I almost lost it at first. I upgraded both the RAM with another 8GB and switched out the hard drive for a Crucial MX300 525GB SATA 2.5 Inch Internal Solid State Drive. The thing flies now. It's construction is a little flimsy but I use it as a desk top unit. So far when I used it as a laptop the battery was good and I had easily 4-5 hours of work.
The hard drive is a weak point in this laptop. Replace with a SSD and you've got a really solid budget laptop. I've had massive problems with Windows services locking things up (automatic updates thrashing hard drive, Defender locking up CPU, etc.), but I've no particular reason to place the blame on the laptop. Windows 10 is neither respectful nor considerate of the user. It's in charge and will do what it likes. I'd recommend Win 7 if you have an applicable license.
I have bought 2 Asus laptops in my lifetime, my first one was a gaming laptop which sometimes decided to turn on and sometimes it decided not to making me remove the battery and put it back in every single time I wanted to boot it up. I decided to give Asus another try, I bought this computer a few weeks ago and I have already regretted my purchase. From a slow boot up time, to my computer freezing when I am not doing anything demanding, you can get a faster and better laptop for half the pricw. Simply not worth the 500 I paid.
worked well until it was dropped once and the screen cracked but that wasn't "their" fault, machine was a little heavier than expected but battery lasted as expected and machine performed well while it lasted
bad item.came with an window office license used in another computer and suppose to be a new computer.. im so disappoint with this item..also came later than expected
This computer is crap. When i need it to work, it has to update. When i need to use my USB headset, the sound craps out. It is an absolute headache. Donât buy it.
Only three days old. Specs are as advertised. Lot of hardware for an excellent price. Replacing mywife's 6 year old computer and this is so much faster than the old one she is overwhelmed. We arehaving a steep learning curve as it is Windows 10.
Work very fast and very useful for home-user. All functions work. Thanks
It came with a defective CD/DVD burner. Otherwise nice, and I do have another computer I can use for that. Plus, it does play those media; just doesn't burn them.
For the price i can't complain. I got all the specific things i wanted. I am fairly easy to please and dont need much. However, I just dont like the keyboard...not super easy to type.
The monitor connections began to fail about 2 months after purchase, requiring me to put pressure on the bottom bezel to see anything on the screen. Then the hard drive started to fail. I tried to file an insurance claim through Asurion that I purchased through Amazon but they insisted that it would still be under manufacturers warranty. When I contacted Asus, I was told that they do not cover hardware malfunctions. Now I am stuck with an unusable laptop that neither the manufacturer nor the insurance I paid extra for will service. Will probably not be purchasing and Asus products or Amazon's Asurion insurance again for that matter.
Good I guess. This thing is what I wanted. Has the specs, but seems to always be running a bit slow. I've trouble shot many issues and sometimes I can get it working up to speed. But for the first 3 months, 70 percent of the time, it runs like a 5 year old computer.
I didn't expect a fancy laptop because I was looking for reliability. I had only Dell until now but they have poor reliability and many times I sent them for repair so I decided to change since my last Inspiron 17 5000 failed in 14 months. (very disappointing)First time with Asus and I'm satisfied even when I have it less than a week, I think adding memory is a must so I will. Intel Graphics worked smoothly without blinking, easy to setup unlike USB-C ports whit adapters that cause problems. No bloatware (thank you) it will upgrade Windows 10 in the initial setup, lets see about reliability in the future.Good for the price!
We've bought two and are happy with them thus far.
Purchased for me by my husband who does computers for a living. After weeks of negotiating on what I wanted and what I needed and why I did NOT want a gaming system, this is perfect. And the right price point for me. I am a writer and handle our family's household needs, and this is perfect.
Good all around laptop for the money. Well built and easy setup. The i5 intel processor is speedy, but the start up sequence takes longer than it should. The fingerprint feature is pretty neat, but doesn't always work. Overall a good laptop that I would buy again.
The choice to equip this laptop with a mechanical hard drive was like having a sports car powered by a VW beetle engine... It works, but it's SLOOOOOOOWWWWWWW! Like, 3-4 minutes to boot.I swapped in a SSD, and it is super peppy and a great machine.
Got what I paid for, and hallelujah no bloatware. When you start it up for the first time, the only icon you see on the home screen is the recycle bin. Even when I went to the uninstall programs section which was a routine, all I saw were 16 programs all related to the functionality of the system. Perfect.
Got this for my mom, it's been great. Nice build, didn't come with any junk software, keyboard is easy to use, set up was simple. And if you still need a VGA port, it has one! Thanks to the reviewer here on Amazon for pointing this out.
Received this computer without a battery. Been looking for 6 months and cannot find anyone that carries it. Do not purchase unless you want to be stuck with a desktop computer. So dissapointed that I canât get this resolved...
so far so good. only tiny issue is that little circle that shows up next to the cursor/pointer that indicates the computer is "thinking" or doing something. That comes on a lot and only way to get rid of it is to cntrl+alt+del and then task manager and then close out the task manager. then it goes away. if you know your way around a pc then you know what I'm talking about.Everything still works whether the little circle appears or not. it's just annoying.
Great product for the price. I had no issues with the setup and it was up and running within 30 minutes. Although, not a gaming laptop, it can still play older games. I have had it for a couple of months now and I have not had a single issue. Speakers are not the best quality which is why I gave it 4/5 stars.
Can't beat the cost-benefit ratio, on this elegant, functional business laptop, which delivers solid heavy-duty work performance all day.
First time using an Asus. I purchased this immediately after returning the Dell Inspiron and after putting it through the same test (Monopoly on Pogo.com) the performance is much better. Feels like a business-quality laptop. I would appreciate a thinner laptop along the lines of an XPS or Zenbook, but at this price point Asus makes me feel like I got the better end of the deal.
It is a great laptop for its price. Although it has some annoying flaws:- The battery of the laptop isnt 9 hours long! it luckily supports 4 hours turned on.- It always stops and it just freezes. I have to wait until it starts to run again.- It has a pretty sensible screen. By this I mean if you touch the screen with your finger, it leaves a mark very difficult to take off.Even so, I dont regret a bit having purchased this laptop. Great price!
I've owned Asus computers and mother boards for a long time and they have always met my expectations.Their support is good and the forums are helpful. This P-Series is fast and the screen is sharp.
I'm loving this computer! It's fast and the video quality is very good. The sound quality is pretty good as well though it could be a little better. The finger print reader is very convenient. It boots up very quickly. Overall, I am very pleased and I think it functions just as well a more expensive computer.
My family was in need of a new laptop after our last one crashed. Price worked out just right for the features we were getting. Nice large screen makes it easy to watch videos. Easy to make video calls with family.
Works just fine.
Good computer for the price. Very light weight. Very good volume. It has some features that are just irrelevant for home use but it is a business standard. I am happy with it. I wish the delivery had been as secure as the computer bag delivery was. They just left it at the door when I had a message that it had to be signed for due to the price. Luckily we were going out when the mailman was walking away, so no one got a chance to steal it.
I bought this laptop for use at school, and for use as/when I open my own business. I have been using it every day for my college business courses, and it has performed very well. The battery lasts a good long time, and I only have to charge it overnight.
Computer started blue screening immediately after purchase, gradually worsened until blue screens every time it's used, if it can even be logged into, because it blue screens so much when booting up that it triggers it's own security settings and won't let me log in.Additionally, it is very glitchy when "working" and blue screens during regular operation, not just boot up.Unusable.
Nice, not so lightweight, battery lasts forever, fast & ergonomical. I liket it and will recommend it.
No keyboard light but overall it's a really good laptop. I use it for university. I!I'm cyber security major.
Very good computer but miss the lights on the Cap lock and numbers lock keys.
Very pleased except for one issue: It doesnât illuminate anything when switching from NUM LOCK to arrows. No way to tell other than trying.
Its ok for the cost, but the screen looks really washed out.
Bought this laptop for a field technician. Solid build for business purposes. Planning on buying another one for myself.
My husband loved this computer and feels it was great for the price. We researched computers for a long time before making this purchase and boy was it worth it.
It fits my needs but start up is a bit slow. Since its for my business its not such a big deal, other than that it operates as expected and works fine.
False advertising! Comes with a dvd\rw that doesnt work because you have to buy the software to use the dvd player after you recieve it. Windows 10 does not support the dvd functions without buying the dvd app from Microsoft. I found this out by chatting with the Microsoft support tech. I'm betting all the other pc and laptops with Windows 10 are the same way. Sounds like a class action lawsuit to me.
Excellent, solid, and powerful laptop at great value. I gave 4 stars because the laptop I got Windows 10 was not licensed so I returned it back and ordered other piece.
Got my first blue screen of death a few months after purchase. Was able to do a reset of the system and things were working fine for a while. Now it won't boot up, and just freezes in the middle of the reset process. 9 months old and already having major issues. How sad. My old Toshiba laptops are still going strong after years of use, which is good, because my ASUS has become a $500 paperweight. Useless.
I'm still getting used to this laptop. The keyboard is a bit different than I'm used to using.Overall performance has been fine.
I use my computer for surfing the web and emails. Clearly this machine can do much more. It's light weight and the keys have a good feel to them.
Great computer, got it for my wife for work since she works from home and she uses it every day. Great machine for the money.
For the price, it's ok as a backup because it's lighter to carry in a backpack than most other laptops
It came with faulty HDD. As I allready took it out of the USA it was imposible to return it back.
Battery does NOT live up to the promise. Neither the speed. Disappointing. Sorry I bought this
I would give it 5 stars, but the speaker is too quiet. Any noise in the room, even with the volume all the way up, and you won't be able to hear it. You will need to buy external speakers or use head phones. Other than that, I haven't had any problems with it at all.
The touch pad is different then I have seen before. It is all 1 piece that just tilts slightly when you use the left and right buttons.Mine failed after 7 months.They offered to let me send it to Texas for repair, but this has my life on it, and I can't let it go for that long.Will have to pay to have it fixed locally.
Absolutely ridiculous, have had it for a couple of months it has updated about 10-12 times and freezes on is all the time! Canât get it to restart, canât use it for internet. Pretty slow and useless, waste of money
Purchased this in June for my son's birthday. He's an fps gamer and loves it.
my gaming laptop had water spilt all over it so I had to sprint for a new one. In a pinch, this laptop does what it is supposed to do for work but dont try to play games with it
So far, I like it.Asus is doing a good job.All I have to do is to start to work with PC again in order that I get used on it..., after many years using only Mac.
great computer worked out of the box, although Skype or the camera has an intermittent problem..
It is good but as fast as my expectation.
Very low end gaming laptop. I was able to run MKX on it to my surprise.
I bought two of these. Very impressed - fast and feature rich. The drawback is with Windows Update - one required a call to Microsoft - it was not able to update on its own.
As a business man running three companies, this laptop is all I need.It's light, fast and has the basics for all my business.needs.The 1TB hard drive is more than enough and all in all, this is a great product and surely prices right!
Works great as an automated PLEX server. Totally worth the cost, which was $500 at the time.
This is a really a wonderful laptop which has more features which was impressive as ASUS is a quality product. The service from the seller was superb and wish to say thank you for selling this product on Amazon to South Africa.
Bought for a gift. My son seems to love it.
Received the laptop on Wednesday. On Monday of the following week, the screen wouldn't come on so I recharged the battery all day Tuesday. Tuesday evening, the screen still didn't come on. Searched the internet and found out that this is a recurring issue with ASUS (look up You Tube). Spent about 30 minutes to an hour with technical assistance at Amazon and could get nothing to work. Returned for a better machine. Seriously, we turned on and used the machine three times before the screen issue. Will not purchase and ASUS again.
Just upsetting. The screen started flickering from the first moment I opened the box. I read in forums this a common problem in Asus computers, sadly I did too late. It is not worth the money and the waiting time. Go for another brand.
I'm still trying it out. The only feature I currently do not like is the location of the mouse pad.
Thanks! Works wonderfully, as expected.
I love this laptop! Business/school oriented, easy layout to navigate, and easy to customize to personal use. I'm kind of clutzy, but it's proven to be durable, and hasn't given out on me yet! Good first owner experience
It's a great laptop, all good but the only problem i have troubles to activate windows 10. Obviously its great for work office or basic scientific research.
Flimsy charger. Broken in few weeks. ASUS does not sell replacement. They suggest that I should buy generic one. Device is still under warranty. Debating whether to go through trouble of getting a new one (or a replacement) and reinstalling everything or just buy a charger. Some consolation- ASUS customer service says generic charger wont void warranty on device.For anyone interested in buying, the status is same for battery! No replacement part!Unfortunate, because it is a good laptop. Poor after-sale support kills brands......
It's amazing, great power at a great price! has a great resolution, HDMI and VGA ports, USB 3.0 x 3 and one USB 2.0, beautiful case, super slim, and the speakers are good enough. Keyboard and touchpad are really good. 100% recomended
For the price it's pretty good but the screen is poorly attached / has poor reinforcement and gets messed up pretty quickly from normal wear and tear use. Be very gentle or your screen will be trash within a year
Exactly what I needed!
its a nice laptop all and all. I did expect it to be a bit faster. i still dont have any programs only photoshop and sometimes it gets slow whe working on PS. I hope it doesn't get worse in time. Other than that its a pretty nice laptop.Another thing i dont really like is the material the use for it. The finger get market everywhere.
was not happy with this asus, screen went into verticle lines a couple of days after buying it. No problems returning it
My son loves this computer. Uses it everyday for college and no problems.
This laptop is fine for my needs. The three 3.0 along with the one 2.0 USB ports AND DVD drive were selling points for me.
Great laptop - no reglet
Got it for my son. He uses it for school and of course gaming. The battery is very good and performance is great too.
Excellent Product. I'm really happy with this laptop! The Battery is really amazing and It is slim, I love it!
It's slow but not bad as a backup. Just don't rely on it.
Durable laptop, good for working. Just has a bug where some windows are a black screen for a few seconds after opening, other than that, pretty good. Battery life resilient.
One of the worst machines I've ever purchased. Immediately returned. Made of a low grade plastic that makes it feel like a toy, and it's no joke that a pair of $5 USB speakers would be an upgrade over the internal speakers included which are tinny and cheap.
Great computer, worth the money. Fingerprint scanner works flawlessly.
Excellent performance great product thanks
Was super slow and seemed to have some issues for a brand new laptop- maybe was a lemon and not all are like that...I returned and ordered an Acer that cost only a little more and that has turned out to be fantastic!
What a bargain!!! A very modern computer with all the good stuff--including Win10 Home 64bit--for an incredible price. And, out of the box, you can't tell it from new!
Ordered 2 of the same model computer. Both arrived in working condition but began having graphical issue very soon after. We had one replaced and that one has been functioning fine. The other was not heavily used and so the window to return it passed. We will have to take it in to be fixed.
First one of these was DOA with screen not working. However, I've always been fond of ASUS's products, especially their motherboards which are the best.
This has to be one of the finest laptops that I have ever owned. Its speed, graphics, and overall performance is top of the line. I would recommend this too gamers, professionals, and students involved in Computer Sciences and engineering.
Great buying experience!!! Highly recommended!!!
Very good laptop. However there is a need for the led for the num lock.
Love it, more power than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, looking forward to using this for the long haul
I had this laptop in my possession for one month and the screen went out. Customer Service told me I had to send it in to them for repair, which could take 3-5 weeks. I am an independent contractor that lives on my PC, and having to replace it so I could continue working was not in my plan.
Love it Thank You
After 2 months battery doesn't work. I hope It's not going to cost me to fix.
Great value for the price.
I got a defective item. Hinges were loose and the screen flickered almost immediately in my first use.
It ticks all the right boxes in terms of speed, screen and number of ports. Only, a little too bulky both in size and weight. But at the price, I don't think there is any alternative with i5 7th Gen and 1TB hard drive.
A nice laptop, my mom likes it and uses it to run her blog
Love this computer!!Was a great buy for the money and is working beautifully.
Great laptop, but the hard drive really slows it down more than I would have expected. Screen looks great and setup went smoothly.
Purchased this laptop, it comes in, I unbox it, charge it, press power and... Nothing. The laptop power light illuminates, but the screen stays black.I followed every troubleshooting step out there, and no luck. Right out of the box the computer was completely dead.So, now I get to return it, and my wife (who I bought it for) is upset because she needed the laptop for work.
Fast, lightweight, sleek design, big screen, DVD drive, just all around excellent computer.
Good laptop but had faulty touchpad. Sometimes left click wouldn't work
It works great so far
Excellent Very fast No problems.
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON WHEN HE STARTED COLLEGE AND HE IS AS HAPPY AS A 7 YEAR OLD AT DISNEYLAND.
I would of not picked item but my nephew recommended it and it works great.
I have not used it a lot, but it seems to be good
Excellent product, very fast.
AC adapted is poorly made and flimsy. It broke off at the connector into the computer. I contacted customer service for ASUS and the service is and they were no help at all. A big disappointment and I regret this putchase
Attention to detail wouldâve prevented this from happening, Iâm sure the laptop is great but without a power cable itâs a paper weight
Great price for such a computer!
Turned on the laptop; updated everything and suddenly started freezing... poor performance! It is not what is says in the descriptio. Laptop should have lasted at least 5 hours battery life when using HDD But unfortunately this one lasts not more than 2 hours. And as stated; brand new laptop; good Quality on hardware but software just sucks; freezes when you open media player and second simple software. Just hate it after a week of purchase.
Don't get the refurbished item. Not a good looking laptop
The speaker is really really weak and the display doesn't look like full HD. the rest is fine and I love the design.
I think this computer is awesome for the money. If you are looking for a Windows computer for under $500, it's hard to beat this one.
Good for the price
It makes a noise that makes it hard to concentrate.
Work great! No issues to date. Fast
Great Business Laptop just wish it was real Aluminum case not textured Plastic
This computer is awesome it is very fast and I have used for my colleges and others activities thank you
It's fine, but this HDD is too slow, if you buy it, replace it with a SSD.
excellent product very happy
Love this laptop! I had used Lenovo for 12 years and it is a great change.
Got it for my wife. She loves it.
The speakers suck, but overall it's a great laptop.
Everything matched the advertised features.
My daughter loves it! Very satisfied with it and worth every penny.
Full satisfaction.
Great business or school lap top.
great price /value.
I love this laptop, I bought one and it had to be replaced less than a week later because of the Window's 10 Creator's update. This update is the main reason I had to buy a new laptop, it pretty much crippled my old laptop beyond repair. This update gave blue screens, extreme lagging, and overall instability. ***DO NOT INSTALL WINDOWS 10 CREATOR'S UPDATE***So, after trying to fix it and that not working, Amazon easily exchanged it for a new one. It's FANTASTIC with Windows 10 home (not creator's update) It's super fast and stable, the battery life is so great.I mainly use it for work, I don't have a lot on it. Mainly everything is cloud based, so basically the only thing I really run is Office and The Sims 2. If anyone reading this played The Sims 2 when it first came out, you remember SLOW loading times. I remember it could be 10 minutes of loading sometimes, not with this laptop. It probably takes 4 minutes to get to my family (except if I've added some new content or mods, may take 6 minutes)Hardware is great, the keyboard and casing of the laptop is a HARD plastic. At first it felt flimsy compared to my old hard metal computer, but I love it now. It just took some getting used to from that change.I would definitely buy this again!
Very heavy.
Be very careful, if you need different browsers and extensions, you might, as I have done, rendered this laptop almost useless.Even different anti-virus for web use and local machines might stop you dead.I will start all over again, that's well over 500 hours of wasted time.t's needed.Ray Romero.I thought I'd give this thing one more look see. One star is too high. I can not even file a complaint, i verify a code number.
DO NOT BUY! I've never dealt with a computer that has so many issues in my life. You have a 30 day return policy and I didn't start using the laptop until after the 30 days was up. I bought this laptop specifically for studying and I can barely even run Word. It constantly crashes and locks up!!!! The only thing I've done on the laptop so far is load Microsoft Office 2016 and it was already causing trouble before I did that.
extremely extremely extremely slow.We didn't use it right away because it was a present. We opened it, started using it and it does not have anything in it and it takes a while to open anything. I added more RAM and there was no difference. It is totally un unusable. you can't even play solitaire with it. Now there is no-where to go and ask for support.
For what you pay, I do feel that you get your money's worth. It is a fast laptop with a lot to offer. Aesthetically, I do like how it looks, but I don't like how easily it shows fingerprints. I'm also coming from a 17" laptop, which means that I'm having to readjust to a more confined keyboard...so for the time being I am not a huge fan of the chiclet style keys. But I'm hoping that time remedies that.
PROFESSIONALS BEWAREThis is not a professional class laptop. This is a machine with great stats and less than top quality hardware. The unit is plastic. The warranty repair policy is simple: "send it in for repairs". That's it. you cant even get them to send out a replacement optic drive for self repair.Stay with your usual brand.
Just arrived today... charged and setting up... This thing is slow... slow... slow... Hoping I don't have the issues I have been about in recent reviews. Will wait to see if it runs as it should after setup, but so far the set up is slow and already had to hard re-boot once. If performance does not improve, will be returning.
Recieved the computer, turned it on, it didnât boot into the OS, I found that the hard drive screws were removed and the hard drive was shaking around in the laptop, I resecured the hard drive, then booted the computer to find that an unlicensed version of Windows 10 pro was installed on the system, I had to reinstall Windows 10 Home premium and use product key recovery software to find the original oem product key because there was no sticker
Used computer under 8 hours and the computer would not charge. Manufacturer told me to send it back. Used NEW one for under 8 hours and had the same problem. What junk! They didn't even seem to be concerned, it seemed like a normal issue for them. What a waste of time and money.
Once set up everything worked fine and the OS worked well but ultimately returned due to this laptops abnormally large size and overall flimsy plastic feel & framing. If your looking for a commuter/business/on-the-go laptop this is not what you want due to the size and structure.
Own for 2 months, have to install 40some driver updates. If your touch pad no feel, install updated driver
Hi,I called Asus and they hang up on me.As you should know, I`m from Brazil, and i came here just to get my purchases. I got here on Tuesday I tryed to turn the PC on and couldn`t. After emailing you and calling Asus I took my PC to a Computer store and after testing they discover that the hard drive was broken. Because my flyght is monday I had to pay US$100 to fix it.I was buy on Amazon. I`ve being buy for many years, including several computers. This is the last time I buy anything from you.Thank youFrederico Giacomini
The battery is only holding a charge for about 3 hours while the advertising claims 9 hours.Not happy.
Terrible sticky touch pad. I could not use the touch pad so I had to return it. Feels very slow and unresponsive compared to a higher end laptop with the same CPU . I am guessing the CPU is just for specs. They need a matching motherboard to utilize it. Websites would load slow and everything had a little delay.
We've had the laptop for about a month now (just out side of warranty now), the system has been freezing up requiring holding the power button until it reboots. Now the track pad isn't working.I wouldn't recommend anyone get this computer.
i would buy again
Hard to find a laptop with 64bit windows & a full keyword at this price ($500 at time of review). I have two primary grips.1. The track pad is subpar. Not as responsive as I'd expect for 2017 and because there's no tactile difference between the pad and right/left click buttons, I keep right clicking by accident.2. The web cam is garbage, narrow field of view and low definition.If you are looking for a work horse the Asus P2540UA will do the job at a great price. But plan on buying your own webcam and bluetooth mouse.
I BOUGHT THIS LAPTOP 3 MONTH AGO,AND I WAS RECEIVING UPDATES NOTIFICATIONS,I UPDATED EVERYTHIG AND NOW IS A CRAP,IT'S CONSTANTLY CRAHING IT TAKES 3 OR 4 MINUTES TO BOOT UP ,WHEN I TRY TO OPEN A DESKTOP APP IT TAKES FOREVER TO OPEN,BATTERY NOW IS TWO HOURS ONLY.WORST DECISION EVER,DON'T BUY THIS COMPUTER
The speakers don't work
Laptop sold as new, yet Windows product key is invalid and installed on another machine (Non-OEM) per Microsoft Tech Support. ASUS tech support refuses to support the product or provide a legal and valid windows key.Microsoft now deems this laptop as running an illegal copy of Windows.I returned this product to Amazon and will not buy from ASUS again.DO NOT BUY
SUPERBLY SLOW, just got it and its extremely slow. i hate the display. in task manager, disk is at 100%, the disk may be corrupted wtf is this asus
Great computer. Faster and better made that the HP I had. HP only lasted 14 months before the motherboard went out.
So far it works good.
Absolutely useless. I bought this hoping to just be able to do simple word, excel and things of that nature, can't do any of them. Constantly freezes, unreliable and no product support.
for the price, does not have a good quality and speed.
Itâs was so lovely nice and cool but just that I but it for someone as a gift and it was going to Europe until that person told me that he check it. Tanks once more Amazon
Easy to use
Overall, Iâm very impressed with this laptop and consider the price to be quite reasonable.Specifically:Listed as a âlightweightâ?laptop, Iâd place it in the higher end of that classification, or even as a lower-end âmiddleweight.â?Iâve used a number of laptops that were lighter than this one, though itâs certainly portable enough to carry around for a day.Battery/power: The battery is supposed to last for 9 hours. Mine was dead to begin with and needed charging right out of the box, but it only took about an hour to charge up. I like the design of the power cord: the heavier segment that connects to the wall outlet and the adapter is shorter, making the cord lighter.Setup: Easy as pie to put together and setup. Quick and immediate hookup to the Internet. Cute greeting as you get started customizing the computer, though it doesnât offer a time to finish updates or percentages on how far itâs gotten, so best to leave it alone to do its workâabout 10 minutesâand come back later. Thereâs another, brief delay (a few minutes) for more updates later on in the process. Opens up with a lovely seascape screensaver. THIS LAPTOP DOES NOT COME WITH THE MICROSOFT OFFICE PACKAGE. YOU HAVE TO ORDER AND PAY FOR IT SEPARATELY (âWPS OFFICEâ?is included on the system DVD that comes with this laptop but no product key is provided to activate it).Internet: The browser offered is Microsoft Edge. Opens to an advertisement for Edge. Pretty fast page loads, though Iâve seen quicker (to be fair some of the other, later uploads on this machine were lightning fast, as quick as Iâve seen). Online videos play smoothly and easily, without hiccups. Full screen videos look great. Sound is set, to begin with, at 67 percent.Fingerprint ID: Nice touch (literally). Cool function for added security.Keyboard: The pad and clicker is placed to one side, the left, which can take getting used to. I've found myself right-clicking something by mistake because of the offset design.Connections/Memory: Love the dozen ports on the left side available for connecting to other units in a variety (5) of different modes. Also a headphone and another port on the right side. Comes with a DVD/CD player/drive (right side); no DVD player comes with this unit (youâd have to purchase one), though you can play music CDs on the Windows Media Player. This unit comes with a quick-and-easy switch-out setup for replacing memory--just a few minutes to complete--which I think is fantastic.Installation DVD that comes with this laptop includes ASUS Business Manager; USB Charger; WPS Office; Winflash (which, for some reason, wouldnât play a functional DVD on this app after I downloaded it; actually, I couldnât find it on my laptop after downloading, either, even after rebooting, which is weird); and Touchpad Handwriting. Be advised that youâll have to re-enter the computer after each download, using your password (automatic restart, over and over and over; a hassle, bite the bullet, get it done).All in all, as I say, a nice laptop with lots of memory (8 gigabytes of RAM memory, a full terabyte on the hard drive).
very slow. takes forever to open a file or an app. actually very disappointed. going to try and get my money back.
Great laptop, great price, great perfomance. The only thing that I dislike is that is too dark to work in the night
Great computer for the proceed. Awesome value.
I am rarely inspired.This computer has done this and I thank Asus and Amazon for being a muse to me.I bought this to replace a ten year old computer that is dying. The old loyal computer was an Asus so I figured hey maybe I will get 10 years out of this one.This computer is similar in many ways to the old one. It has more power and Windows 10. They tell me its the future.Unlike many of the other posters mine did turn on. It did let me set it up. I installed an antivirus and a couple browsers. This is where things began to take a turn for the worse.I replaced the old computer because the delay time for actions on it have increased over the last couple months and along with a dying battery it seemed time.Asus and Amazon have delivered here. It takes longer to launch a browser on the new computer than it does on than it does for me to start the old one from totally off and launch the same browser. Pretty much everything on this computer is slow. I tried swapping the AV as I figured perhaps it was slowing things down but alas it naturally slow. I am not asking anything difficult of it, which is good as it is basically a potato.The bottom line is that this computer is junk. I did not have this issue with previous Amazon laptops but this episode will force my shadow to darken the door of a Best Buy.I'll try to get my money back take my warning to heart and buy something else. Its not a deal if its junk.
Very nice, has all the bells and whistles ððð
Excelentt product
So good .
Good product!
I got mine and it's awesome!
Excellent. Good machine
I've had this laptop for 2 months and it. is. awful. I didn't want to spend too much on a new computer seeing as I only use it for online shopping, emails, and microsoft office but it was the worst decision ever. Honestly if I could return it I would. Amazon listed it as being "new" but there is no reason it should freeze and be this slow after 2 months of use. Spend the extra $200 and get yourself a Lenovo.
I like this laptop, although I truly would like something smaller---but that's on me, I should have measured what it'd be!
I just upgraded the office and am very happy. One of the easiest transitions I've had
Very pleased with this item and the care Amazon team took to deliver safely. Thanks.
I believed that I was purchasing a laptop with the applications installed on the laptop and part of the purchase price, as had always been the case in the past. Imagine my surprise when I find that I have a 30 day FREE trial before I have to "Subscribe" to it on a monthly basis, or have to "Pay" for it. I was furious when I found out that I had purchased a laptop that didn't come with the normal applications paid for and installed on it. Shame on me! But not again.
awesome! love it!
Its not price worthy
zero problems
Very flimsy lid, 2 months of use and screen cracked by just opening lid. Not covered by warranty and $200 to get repaired. Was Not dropped or dinged in any way.
This computer was very disappointing in speed. Doing anything, such as installing, web browsing, was extremely slow. Just unusable. We wanted to get this computer to replace our aging Lenovo Ideapad Z570. But we didn't look very closely at the specs. This computer's CPU is an Intel i5, with only 4 processor cores, where the Z570, over 6 years old, has an i7 with 8 cores. So the new Asus was slower than the old Lenovo. I couldn't see any reason to keep it, so I returned it. It was functioning properly, it was just a slow computer.
Only one USB port which I need for my wireless mouse. I have a USB CD drive, but couldn't use it unless I unplugged my wireless mouse. I sent it back.
When I bought this computer, I was under the impression Window was included. WINDOWS IS NOT INCLUDED! Other than that, it is a great computer.So not only is Windows NOT included with this computer but I've had it for less than 2 months and now the battery isn't charging. It will only work if it is plugged in & immediately dies when you unplug it because it will NOT charge the battery.
I've had an ASUS Zenbook for about a year and a halfÂ ASUS ZenBook UX303UA 13.3-Inch FHD Touchscreen Laptop, Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 10 (64 bit)Â That I've really liked and been happy with. It's smaller than this ASUS laptop, but has similar specs for processor and RAM power. My Zenbook was my first laptop with a SSD drive instead of a hard-drive, and while I do really like it and am happy with it, I'm always worried I'll use up all the space on the SSD and so I end up relying on Microsoft cloud storage much more than I'd like to. I saw this ASUS with a 1 TB hard drive - which is pretty huge - and decided to snap it up. We're using it as our "family" computer, and sort of the central repository for documents, photos, etc. We use it directly, but also access it via our home network for stuff. It's easy to work with and so far seeming to be a really nice laptop. A few years ago I avoided ASUS, thinking they were crappy despite the many good reviews. However, I've since changed my opinion and have become a big ASUS fan, with now 2 ASUS computers and 3 ASUS zenfones. So, here's why I've had a change of heart along with my review which leans heavily on comparing this laptop with my ASUS Zenbook.....My history with ASUS and why I went from hating them to loving them:Originally, way back when, my husband had a couple of ASUS computers and I thought they were crappy because he went through two of them within a years time as they'd always malfunction. Well, we realized it's him - seriously! - there's something about him and the windows platform that doesn't work well together and he seems to just kill all his microsoft computers (even his work issued Dell dies and malfunctions constantly when he has to work from home). For home use he switched to a Mac (which I despise, but to each his own...) and he's been a happy camper for 3 years now - a record for him!Meanwhile, a little over a year and a half ago I nervously bought an ASUS Zenbook after having disappointing performance & two BUS replacements due to factory build issues on a thinkpad within a year of (very expensive) purchase, followed by repeated fan failure on an HP after only 2 months (the HP was supposed to be the replacement for the crappy thinkpad). I then sought out what had the best reviews for a small, lightweight laptop that also had strong performance and reliability, and at that time the ASUS kept coming up again and again, with the Zenbook being their smallest/lightest version. The Zenbook has been great, much more hearty and stable than all my various past laptops, and is able to handle the 100+ tabs I often have open in my browser when researching (I kid you not, the last onetab app gathering up of tabs I had 181 open tabs, plus MSword open, pdf reader open and it was running fine and dandy!). I even ended up getting 3 ASUS zenphones because of my positive experience - and we love those as well! We have twoÂ Asus ZenFone 3 ZE520KL Unlocked Dual Sim Phone, 32GB, 5.2-inch, 3GB RAM, No Warranty - International Version (Moonlight White)Â and one deluxeÂ ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe 5.7-inch AMOLED FHD display, 6GB RAM 64GB storage Unlocked Dual SIM Cell Phone, US Warranty (ZS570KL-Glacier Silver)Â (I have the deluxe and love, love, love it!). Anyways, the point is I'm now a fully on board ASUS fan having had no problems and superior performance on all my ASUS devices over the past couple of years.THIS particular ASUS laptop:We wanted something we could store our many digital images and documents on, so something with a big hard drive (yes, I know I can just get an external hard drive for that - and we do have a few - but we wanted a laptop with a big drive built in and all the other performance features I've come to expect from my Zenbook). This met the criteria with the large drive, plus it has the same RAM and processor I've got in my Zenbook. My Zenbook has touch screen and this does not, but in the grand scheme of things I really don't use my touchscreen all that much. This has a long battery life, just like my Zenbook - unlike many computers that report a long battery life but in reality drain quickly, I've found my Zenbook to really and truly have a long battery life & so far this one has a similar reliability, although we don't use it on battery all that much. This is bigger, 15.6" vs 13.3" and 2lbs heavier than my Zenbook but still pretty lightweight for a bigger laptop & can easily be transported around. Should my Zenbook die (please say no) I'd have no issues taking this laptop on an airplane with me on a trip.This has TPM security & I honestly don't know what that is so I can't comment on that. It also has a fingerprint reader, and like the one on my Zenfone it works pretty well (wet fingers are the only time I find a challenge, so I have to do an extra drying after washing hands, etc. if I want it to read my print). The wifi connection and speed seems no different between this and my Zenbook and both clock the same speeds on our internet connection. I will say it doesn't start up instantly like my Zenbook does, but I think that's related to having a SSD drive vs a hard drive, as I believe that is a benefit to an SSD drive. However, it's not like it takes a prolonged amount of time to start up - for a laptop with a hard drive I believe it's where it should be.Special features of this laptop:There are special features on this computer since it's marketed as a "business" laptop. You can wake it over a network (something I'm not likely to do & haven't used so can't speak to this), and it has an easily accessed inside so that you can upgrade RAM. The battery is removable - something that used to be standard with most laptops and is now rare. I suppose if you travel it may be helpful to have an extra and swap it out? This, again, is a feature I don't really need or use. There is also an additional "business" app that ASUS put on there that's supposed to help when using this as a business laptop - I don't use this. I think generally heavy business users are more productive on systems that are faster and more powerful (the processor and RAM) and that's most of why they're calling this a business laptop. However, unless you solely read email and surf the internet I think those are important features for most users and allow the flexibility to use it for most anything you might want. I think that also makes it possibly a good computer for entry level gamers, too.Possible use for gaming??My daughter has an Alienware, which is optimized for gaming. Gaming is intense on your onboard systems and so need stronger computers to handle them well. I don't do the super action games, but my zenbook and this laptop can handle Sims4 7 minecraft on the high quality/high definition graphics & screen resolution without stuttering or issues. However, when compared to what it looks like on my daughter's Alienware hers is absolutely much more crisp, clear and defined (part of this is her screen is also higher resolution even though my computer is high definition), and she has special memory and drivers allocated to graphics. However, I don't know how well this or my Zenbook would do on Overwatch and other fast moving online gaming platforms. BUT! Before she had her Alienware she was able to play Overwatch on a computer that had similar specs to what my Zenbook has, just at lower graphics. This makes me think that this laptop *might* be a good, low cost option for gaming for an entry level gamer - especially since it's easy to access the innards and upgrade RAM. Something to consider for those who aren't willing to fork out the big $$$ for expensive gaming laptops (although I will say we initially weren't willing to spend the money, but eventually we caved and bought the Alienware for our daughter and she definitely has less power issues, better graphics and better timing responses when gaming while also being able to use it for school and everything else needed...).For StudentsThis is a great option for students, esp. college students for a low cost yet powerful laptop that can handle most anything they need. There is plenty of room for tons of documents (reports, class notes, downloaded documents, etc.) and it can handle having multitudes of tabs open for students who are doing a lot of research online. It also easily handles having several applications open at once along with the multiple tabs (Typically I'll have Word, Powerpoint, PDF reader, File explorer, and my browser with at least 30+ tabs open at once - and often two browsers, chrome and firefox, all at the same time. I teach online & do a lot of course and assignment creation, thus the many programs all open at once. As mentioned above, it also handles some gaming, although they may need to optimize it by adding stuff for fast paced gaming like Overwatch and FPS games.Lastly, from experience a few years back, when my husband kept killing his ASUS computers and I thought they were crappy - the customer service for repairs was good and sending in computers for repairs had a quick turn-around (under 2 weeks including mailing time both ways). However, we live in the SF Bay area and for us the repair center was also in the SF Bay area - perhaps it would be longer for folks who aren't so close to an ASUS repair center.SUMMARY: Nice, powerful, easy to use yet inexpensive laptop from a company that has demonstrated solid, reliable computers & phones. Great for Business users, students, and anyone wanting a fast & powerful laptop at a low cost. Reccommended.
Setup took a while, but I just let it do its thing while I did other stuff. My only complaint is one for the Windows OS, but the laptop is really nice.
I ordered this for my husband and it works great. The price on this is as god as it gets.
The laptop did not work well. I did not walk a letter on the keyboard and also did not load well at first. I had to give it back to you.
This laptop keeps booting to an error that resolves after repeated booting. When the error occurs, the only options are to reinstall windows or use a system restore point.
Lots of space....I love it
After requiring a hard reset during first time setup last night, the laptop crashed several times while setting up personalization and general web browsing. I was already wary of the cheap HDD that came installed, but problems fresh out of the box? I'm requesting a replacement, but if I have similar problems, this will be the last low-end laptop I purchase from Asus as the quality just doesn't scale up to their higher end or ROG laptops. Disappointing.
I don't know. I've bought ASUS systems from amazon in the past and they were the bomb. This one was brand new outta the box. It lasted 2 hours and the HD died while transfering files. I decided to go back to an HP
LOVE IT!! MUST BUY!!!
came with wifi problems...
Great brand with a great product.
Overall very good laptop. This is a replacement for a Samsung laptop purchased in 2011.Pros: Build feels very solid and high quality. Has an optical drive, which I do still find useful and was looking for in this purchase. Laptop is not "flashy" at all in design--basic black, which is nice if you travel with it and don't want it to attract unwanted attention. Laptop stays cool. Plenty of storage. Screen is good, but contrast could be improved. This is the only laptop I found with every aux port I might need. (Recently spent two weeks in a location where a wired Ethernet connection was still needed to connect to internet). Very little bloatware. So far have found the fan to be quiet, so the laptop is usable in a classroom or business environment without embarrassment of the laptop "revving."Cons: The power/charging cord looks and feels extremely flimsy. Just waiting for the wires to break from flexing so much. Biggest problem with this laptop is not the laptop, but Windows 10. Was aware of that when purchasing. It would also make more sense if this "business" laptop came with Windows 10 Pro instead of Home version. The 1TB mechanical hard drive runs slow--no improvement in speed between this 2017 laptop and my old 2011. Again, a choice made to prioritize capacity over speed. Keyboard does not have backlight.Things to be aware of: This laptop comes with a trial version of Office 365. The full software is not included and must be purchased separately (or purchase a subscription). Default browser is Microsoft's Bing-powered Edge; IE 11 is onboard and can be set as the default. Windows 10 does not have a "Windows Easy Transfer" application, so a work-around or other options are needed if you wish to transfer files from an older laptop.Edit: Be aware that the speakers on this laptop are in the center of the BOTTOM of the unit. Sound quality seems fine as long as laptop is sitting on something.
came to me with language i could not use sent back to company
I was not considering ASUS or buying a laptop through the internet, but the specs on this ASUS hit all the right marks for me. I was after a solid work-focused laptop and I wanted to save as much money as possible by giving up on the frills while keeping the important stuff (I don't care about a touch screen, I don't need a fancy designated graphics card for my purposes, I really don't care about how stylish it looks, how light it is, or how thin it is, etc.). I was deciding between a thinkpad and a latitude, apologizing to my wallet, when I saw this laptop promoted by amazon and bought it the next day.I upgraded the HHD to a Samsung SSD (this one:Â Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E250B/AM)Â ) almost immediately (it was indeed very easy) and am satisfied with this computer in every single way but for one: the screen is terrible. I don't just mean that the screen is not stunning as an apple or xps, I knew that this was a regular anti-glare display going in and I was all for that, I mean that the screen actually causes me tremendous eye strain when working on it for over half an hour (excel, access, word, visual studio). The best I can describe it is that it does not have enough depth or contrast-- everything looks washed out with white-blue light. The fault is not the intel integrated graphics -- those are great. It looks beautiful plugged into any other displays -- its just the screen itself. It seems like a very strange place to save money to me. If it were something that could be upgraded easily I wouldn't take off stars, but replacing the screen on a laptop, especially when you are trying to upgrade and not just replace the stock screen, is tedious work to me. I found a company that will let you send it in to them to upgrade for about $120 and I might give this a try down the road, but that with the SSD upgrade ruin the value I got by going with this laptop over a latitude or thinkpad. For the time being I just use external displays to do any real work on it -- kind of destroying the point of a laptop a little bit.
Sleek and attractive laptop, thin and lightweight but with a very solid feel. Impressive battery life makes this great for travel, for watching movies or for marathon work sessions anywhere. It has a 1 Tb hard drive (1,000 gb). Itâs a mechanical hard drive, which is not going to be ideal for gaming, but is fast enough for most other uses. It comes with 8 gb RAM expandable to 16 gb through the memory door. You can do it yourself and it doesnât take long. There is a slit-type fingerprint scanner for security. The display is good. The touch pad has smart gestures, although you can turn them off. Itâs responsive enough to use for occasional graphics work. Iâm used to Toshiba laptops, have used them for a lot of simple graphics manipulation, sizing photos and correcting minor flaws, and this is as good in that respect. For extensive graphics use, most people would get a larger, clearer monitor, but for a laptop and occasional graphics use, this is more than adequate. The keyboard layout has the number pad to the right and the touch pad centered under the letter area. The laptop uses Windows 10, 64-bit version, and has appealing security and network features such as the ability to wake the computer remotely. I tend to worry about things like that, myself, but remote log-in can be important for business use. Amazingly for something this thin, the laptop has a DVD drive. Itâs nearly as thin as one without one. I was surprised and impressed. Itâs extremely well-designed, both in terms of looks and basic functionality. If youâre shopping for a thin, light laptop for home office use, travel or commuting, that looks great, performs well and feels very solid, Iâd recommend this one. Especially if you appreciate good design. For this combination of design and features, the price is reasonable.
Pros:Quick processor and above-average graphic card8GB DDR4 memory, one stick so that increasing system memory up to16GB requires the purchase of only one more stick of memory vice having to buy two sticks of 8GB.Fingerprint biometric logon.TPM.Clear text matted screen that reduces eye-strain over long sessions of use.No pre-loaded crapware.Cons:The battery that comes with the laptop is model # A41N1421{1}, which is a beefed-up version of the reseller available A41N1421. The reseller battery A41N1421 is rated at an anemic 37Wh and 2600mAh. The A41N1421{1} original battery is rated at 48Wh and 3700mAh, which accounts for the advertised 9hr battery life. The A41N1421{1} is NOT available in the ASUS store. It is also not available anywhere else since it is an ASUS proprietary battery. So if you need an original battery replacement, you are SOL.The ADP-65GD B model power supply that ships with this notebook has a smaller proprietary plug configuration (4.5mm x P0.6 x 10mm 3/ 2 pin compact power supply system) compared to that of a conventional ADP-65GD B power supply that has a plug which is too big (5.5mm x 2.5mm) for insertion into this computer. After much testing with many other power supplies with the same power, voltage and plug dimensions, it is obvious to me that the computer is designed to be powered only with ASUS power adapters. ASUS does sell an over-expensive $80 90W multi-plug power supply witch has the proprietary 4.5mm plug. This power adapter will not give you a re-connect warning prompt. I would recommend the immediate purchase of this ASUS power adapter, since if something happens to the original power supply then the laptop would be rendered useless after the battery depletes.
As a fan of Asus laptops, I found the P2540UA disappointing. Yes, it's aimed at business users, but almost everyone that uses a laptop sneaks in occasional multimedia use, at the very least. While the business features are strong and the laptop is more than fine for office tasks, it's extremely weak at multimedia.On the business side, the laptop's long battery life (fairly accurate to Asus' claims) and security features are commendable. The matte screen is a nice option for road warriors that need to get things done in public places that are sunny.One of the worst things about this laptop is its slow mechanical hard drive. The only reason its used is to keep the price down. Mechanical hard drives are slow and have poor longevity compared to solid state drives. Between the sorry hard drive and relatively modest specs, this laptop fails with modern media.There are Asus consumer laptops that cost slightly more than this model. They are far more versatile than this model, offering performance that can handle business and multimedia use. I can't recommend this laptop when you can get a far better one for $100-200 more.
With each passing year, I'm becoming more and more of an ASUS fan. I love the quality, utilitarian build of their products. Everything is no nonsense and I appreciate that at a time when companies are over indexing on unnecessary and unwanted features.// PROSBATTERY LIFE: The low voltage Kaby Lake processor in this laptop means that the battery lasts and lasts. In addition, the battery itself is replaceable, meaning you can carry an extra one. Perfect for travel when charging could happen infrequently.BUILD QUALITY:This laptop looks and feels solid. It's exactly what you want for the rigors of commuting and travel. It would also make a great machine for the kids.TRACK PAD AND KEYBOARD: The track pad on the P2540UA has the perfect responsiveness and includes useful gestures. ASUS has nailed this. Other laptop manufacturers' track pads can be overly responsive to the point where they're difficult to control and cause unwanted clicks and scrolls. The ASUS also includes a full keyboard with keys that have a satisfying travel. This is another area where manufacturers' skimp on lower-end machines, but ASUS has don't a nice job here.EXPANDABLE MEMORY: ASUS has made it almost trivial to add RAM to this laptop. While 8GBs is a great start for a simple productivity machine, the ability to easily upgrade is always welcome. I immediately addedÂ Crucial 8GB DDR4 2400 MT/S (PC4-19200) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory (CT8G4SFS824A)Â to double the RAM and it took all of 5 minutes.64-BIT WINDOWS 10: This machine comes with 64-bit Windows 10 and allows you to take advantage of everything the OS and Cortana have to offer.NO BLOATWARE: What a treat! This system isn't littered with bloatware.PRICE: This ASUS is phenomenally priced for what you get.// CONSDISPLAY: The display is proving to be lackluster. The viewing angle is poor. You have to manipulate the screen to just the right angle or you lose contrast...significantly. I've found the range of acceptable viewing to have only about 10-15-degrees of freedom. Once you find the sweet spot, it performs ok, but it's poor for any graphics related tasks (or photo manipulation) as the color, contrast, and clarity are not at all there.GRAPHICS: The on-board graphics for this machine uses Intel HD 620, meaning there is no dedicated graphics VRAM. However, you can expand your RAM (see above) and allocate more memory here. An Internet search will tell you how.//SUMMARYOverall, I think this is a great system for business productivity and travel or as a durable machine for the kids. (Heck, it might be ideal that the sound isn't optimal in the latter case. ;) )
This is a good laptop for the price. It feels well made and sturdy. No regrets buying this laptop.The description says it has 9 hours of battery life, but after using it for a few weeks I find that it runs for about ~5 hours before needing to be plugged in.
This is a basic laptop which I bought for reliability, durability and large disc size. Other than the nice finish on the exterior of the lid, however, this laptop does overly exude "basic" on all of its features. Particularly worrying is the optical drive which has an extremely flimsy, plastic extension tray/door, which I fear could easily break. The optical drive also makes quite a lot of noise while playing a DVD. Even worse are the speakers which have extremely low sound, which would make watching a DVD with several friends difficult. On the basis of the Windows 10 icons and text, the screen does look to have poor resolution even though it is technically higher than your basic laptop. It seems this maybe due to Windows 10, as my much older ASUS laptop with a 1366x768 resolution but runs Windows 7 and does look much sharper than this one being reviewed. Whereas Windows 10 icons and text do look very sharp on the high resolution of the Surface 4 tablet. The keyboard build also feels very cheap on this compared to my older ASUS basic ($500) laptop. So in all this is extremely basic and as noted by another reviewer would be best suited for kids (apart from the DVD tray door which certainly wouldn't last long with kids) rather than the business professional. In all, it feels more like this laptop should sell for $400 or less and the $500 ASUS 13" Flip is a far better deal and build.
So far so good. I was able to set this computer up and with in an hour with Norton, Office 365, the HP printer and all my personal documents, pictures and settings. Compared to my previous Toshiba Satellite L55 that crashed and burned soley because of faultly hinges the case on the ASUS is solid no bouncing or screen movement once adjusted. The size is 15.6" compared to the 17" I was used too, there was hardly any adjustment for typing and the keyboard appears to be laid out to type by touch not like the itty bitty laptops that are more for hunt and peck so my DS20 says. A backlit keyboard would have been lovely but what I truly miss are the indicator lights for NUM LOCKS and CAP LOCKS. The mouse pad is very responsive but I still choose to go with a wireless mouse, I do this for any laptop. I like the brushed finish look of this laptop it is very professional looking. I use this for personal, home, and homeschool.
I like this laptop. It's been dependable and easy to work on.When I first got it, the hardest parts for me were getting used to Windows 10 and the keyboard.Windows 10 turned out to be easy. There's a lot on the laptop to get one started with Windows 10 and it shows you and can go over the new operating system. It's very similar to Windows 7. Things are just in different places and set up a bit different.The keyboard took more time to get familiar with. I'd been working on a much older laptop and the keys on the older computer were raised higher and the keyboard was placed right in the middle of the laptop. On this ASUS computer, it has the number keys to the right so everything is shifted over to the left. I had a very rough time typing and locating the correct keys for a long while. But, I'm used to it now.The trackpad is smooth and easy to use. I don't have any problems with my hands pressing on it while I'm typing.The computer comes with a larger drive (1TB) but it's a slow drive. I've got another computer with an SSD and that boots up so quickly. It also access data on the computer very fast. Still, this drive seems fine. The SSD would tack on a bit more money to the cost.The display is bright and clear. I don't see any dead pixels. I do need to sit right in front of the computer to see the display well as if I move off to the side, the screen starts to darken. That's not necessarily a bad thing. If someone is sitting next to me, it makes it more difficult for them to see what I'm working on or eavesdrop of what I'm doing.The battery lasts for several hours. That's such an improvement over my last laptop. I can finally sit in the backyard and work and not have to worry about plugging into power for a long while.Oh, and this laptop stays pretty cool when on my lap. No overheating or burning my legs.There are plenty of USB ports but they are very tight to plug in to. I struggle a bit each time I need to plug or unplug something from the USB port.The indicator lights that show power or the hard drive working, are on the very front edge of the computer, to the left of the keyboard. I'm not used to the indicator lights being so hard to see. Sometimes I click on something and I wait for something to happen and wonder if I clicked or not. So, I click again. I'm getting used to looking down to see if the hard drive light is flashing to show it's working. Just a slight annoyance but it would be nice to have the indicator lights above the keyboard.This laptop has a fingerprint reader and that works great. I have one on my cell phone now, too. It's the best invention! Makes it so easy to login.
DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP. It does not run like it's supposed to. It is definitely not a "business" laptop nor a laptop I would recommend. I have been an active user of ASUS products, but this feels like an imposter to the company. The laptop stopped functioning properly only two months after its opening. I tried to sum it up to Windows 10 being the issue, but it is simply due to the fact that this is a poorly and cheaply made machine. It runs very slow and comes loaded with crap on it. It's shell is plastic and bends and creeks when used. It feels like a dollar store toy, it works, but it's not the real deal. I almost want to assume that this is a gimmick and ASUS didn't make it, but sadly they did. The ratings for this laptop have gone down from when I first bought it. Save your money and buy a better ASUS laptop, this is no way shape or form a "pro" laptop. Actually I recommend not buying computers from amazon due to the fact that they have a lot of issues with cheap stuff like this. If you search this laptop on google, you'll barely find anything on it. Just shop more and don't stretch your dollar for this crap, spend it on a functioning laptop.
This laptop is terribly made and has nonstop hardware issues right out of the box. I returned the first one I received because the battery refused to charge after 2 days and had to be plugged in 24/7. Tech support was unhelpful with this issue and thankfully Amazon's return policy still covered the laptop. The replacement worked perfectly until now, less than 5 months later, the headphone jack isn't working anymore and the left side of the screen gets covered in flickering blue lines, like very fine graph paper half of the time. I have not dropped the computer or gotten it wet. Very dissatisfied with the product. For the price (over $500) it should be built much more sturdily and should at least last a few years without major hardware isues. I can sometimes understand receiving one dud product but two in a row??? The only reason I give it two stars is because the performance and features are solid when the device actually works. I expected much better from ASUS.
This laptop is way over-powered for my basic and simple home business needs, so I may be in a small subset of users who really have no serious complaints at all. It works as expected. I do not do any gaming whatsoever and hate anything to do with touch screen, so this unit is near-ideal in specs and performance. I have never preferred laptops over a desktop in general, but I like the size of this one and the keyboard is okay, and better than many that I have tried. The set-up was straightforward and I like the fact that it does not come with a lot of excess, unwanted software (bloatware). I love having that DVD-RW drive. Plug it in, turn it on, update the Windows version, download Firefox (in my case), and you are in business. Battery life has been good, as expected. It is a good value for the price and all that it will do, and I would give 5 stars if the screen and materials were a little higher quality, as well as the speakers.
I am disappointed in this laptop. I was excited to carry a lightweight laptop to campus and to be able to work on homework. However this laptop can barely even handle playing videos on YouTube and typing on Microsoft Word at the same time. It usually starts to lags within ten minutes and then I have to restart the laptop because it's been frozen for over 15 minutes. I barely had this for a week and more than ready to ship this back for a refund.
This computer may lack some of the bells and whistles of less affordable models, but it is a workhorse. We are using it as the engine of a small recording studio, and it is handling its responsibilities well, literally not missing a beat. While our other laptops are lazily surfing the web or reading emails, the ASUS keeps up with the processing required to transform analog sound into digital data, juggling Adobe products as if they were beachballs. Right now, it's got various pieces of hardware plugged into it, including headphones, a mixer, and a microphone, and there are still ports to spare.Setting up the machine was fast and straightforward, and it's mercifully free of the bloatware that is too often packaged with lower end laptops. I haven't had a chance to test out some of the features, like the long battery life (it hasn't left the studio), but I like the fact that ASUS has nailed so many of the details, especially the keyboard. Most laptop keyboards seem to be tacked on as an afterthought "guess we need one of these too?" not the case with this model, with a keyboard that is solid and comfortable.Here in Silicon Valley, you don't see a lot of people sitting in coffee bars with an ASUS propped up next to their double lattes. It's not the latest or most fashionable me-too accessory. But if you're beyond needing to show how cool you are and simply want a laptop that gets the job done, the ASUS is ideal.
No backlit keyboard....this makes no sense on why you would buy this.
The charger for this is crap, it started getting the warning message to plug in the charger properly, even though it was the one that came with this computer and it is plugged in correctly. After an hour and half with an ASUS "representative" our option was to send in the charger let them look it over,(for who know how long) and be without a charger until they decide they want to replace it, or give them our credit card for $210.00 (yes,ouch) and then they will send us a replacement while they look over our old charger. I really liked ASUS in the past, have bought two desktop motherboards and they worked without a problem. I am no longer buying ASUS after this very sour experience with the charger issue. They have totaled turned me off from their product that they refuse to honor any warranty without jumping through their hoops. "HEY ASUS" I am not going to take a replacement charger (that should be under warranty) and try to sell it on ebay or craiglist, I just want a good product that works. An hour an half on the phone with 4 representative and none of them would change their tune.
Excellent laptop for a small business! I bought three of these and they were a perfect fit for our family consulting business. Very little bloatware. Solid drivers . Network, storage, track pad, and even fingerprint reader all work as expected.Great performance. Solid feel. Very nice keyboard...even for my XL-sized hands. Would definitely recommend for someone who needs a stout, high performance, professional-looking, laptop which will be used for travel or even at home.
This computer is almost un-useable out of the box; the hard drive is absurdly slow. I purchased a ssd to swap for the stock hard drive in hopes that it fixes it, we shall see. If you want it to work without modification, look for something else.- Updated: Cloned the drive to an SSD that cost me another $100. This thing is sweet now, it has everything I need after modifications. I'm not changing the stars but if you buy this know that you'll have to upgrade the hard drive to have a computer that actually works efficiently.
Very nice laptop! It's lightweight and has a long battery life. The programs run quickly and the image quality is great. It came with some Microsoft programs i.e. Power point. Looking forward to using this for school assignments.
I had this for a month and the screen broke. I have never had a screen break on me and my computers usually last years not months. Worst computer ive ever had.
Computer arrived at promised time. The computer is very professional looking with a nice large display. Really like the finger print recognition for added security. The colors really "pop" on the display and text is very sharp/clear. Keyboard is large with the keys well spaced and at a comfortable height from the keyboard. There is quite a bit of memory and processing power built into this machine with the professional in mind. This would not serve a gamer, but for a student or business professional this is the product to have. This is an all round good piece of machinery for the price that was paid for it. I would most definitely recommend this product for someone looking for a computer for every day use.
Permanent black screen during initial windows set up. Is this the fault of the pc or of windows 10?I've seen people complain about this but I've never encountered it before and I've installed windows 10 on multiple computers.After doing something else for a few hours the screen was still black. Eventually I turned on windows narrator and realized that even though the screen was black, the install process was in fact still continuing. I used tab to navigate the invisible options and listened to the narrator until I managed to finish the initial windows installation blind. What a hassle.Will I change this review as I use it and it grows on me? The laptop isn't for me, so that's not really going to happen huh? This one is for my mother and another is coming in tomorrow for my sister. If I have any trouble setting up the second one I'll drop this review from 2 stars to 1 star. I've built my own desktops for years and this was the most annoying initial set up I've experienced for a pc.EditSame exact problem with the second laptop. Needed to use windows narrator to go through the installation because the screen was black until it finished. I'm surprised nobody else has encountered this. What are the odds of none of these people encountering this problem and yet I encounter it two days in a row with two different laptops?
It's causing my husband all sorts of issues, just a few months after purchasing. Working with experts and tech support to try and get it fixed, but it's an annoying, time-consuming process. The computer is also quite heavy to carry around - we should have found one that's lighter weight.
This is the best deal I've found on an HD laptop with DDR4 memory, and RJ45 network port. The HDD can be upgraded to SSD later, as well as the memory. My only problem is that the trackpad is pretty far to the left, which I have always found is a problem for those of us who are right-handed - I keep right clicking instead of left clicking! A mouse is necessary to save your sanity.
I've previously owned Asus, but this computer, similar to my last one, is very slow on start up (probably due to all of the Asus startup programs). The main issue, however, is the computer is less than 3 months old and system will not run on battery power -- it doesn't recognize the battery. I am returning it to Asus and will post more on how the issue was handled.
It is very practical, although if it is delicate, it is best to put a keyboard protector.
The computer is good. It does the job I need it for without problems. The one issue that I had was the battery was not charging but this is just because the power was a 90V cable instead of 125V. I fixed it by just using my old HP laptop power which is 125V. Beside that it has little bloatware and upgrade to Windows 10 Creator.
This is a very nice laptop with a full range of features for the selling price. The 7th Gen Intel i5 Core with 2.5Ghz is a quick enough processor for my speed needs. The 1TB HDD has more than enough capacity for my storage needs. And I find the Business Manager and Fingerprint Scanner very helpful in IT managing and security issues. Five stars for affordability vs features, speed and capacity.
Not the greatest computer. So far it's been slow and had multiple issues. If I hadn't missed the window to return it for full refund, I personally would have. I used to have an awesome Toshiba that gave out after 8 years and just got this one set up recently during my off time from work. It has a large screen which is nice but runs exceptionally slow even though I have few programs/files on it. I'd recommend a different laptop when looking to purchase.
No problems with this laptop. And it doesn't come with a bunch of unnecessary preloaded software that you have to purge! Recommend.
I bought my daughter this computer and then myself a couple of weeks later. DON'T BUY!! The CD drive on both stopped working within a month which sucks when you have video games and software to download. The charger is junk. And if you do have a repair issue, expect to pay Asus just slightly below retail for repairs. They WILL NOT let outside contractors work in their computers. BUY HP. BUY HP. BUY HP. I can't stress enough how much better their computers are. I REGRET my Asus purchases.
works well , didnt see ANY bloat ware , much better then HP on that...... didnt like the keyboard very much.
Bought it for my little brother because he is going to college, outside of the setup (which takes a minute) it performs well under stress.
The colors on scream are not great.
I don't even know how long it's been since I've had a laptop with a CD/DVD r/rw drive, but I love that this ASUS laptop has one It is economical but still packs a hefty feature list, and enough RAM and storage for most casual users.
I expect it to be faster, is ok. Picture ok. Not really happy with it. I think next time I keep HP.
This ASUS P-Series laptop is a no-frills computer that offers good performance for the price, but do not expect any premium features.This 15.6" laptop has a textured matte finish all over...on the lid and on the interior area where you'll be resting your palms, and it's probably the nicest aesthetic that you'll find on this computer. Everything else says budget buy, but that's not really a bad thing here. Inside you're getting a quality 7th gen Intel i5 processor, along with 8GB RAM and a 1TB hard drive. The hard drive is a standard 5,400 RPM disc drive that can be slow at times. Out of the box there is hardly any bloatware to deal with, and after I ran a big initial Windows update I had over 930GB of usable disc drive space. But in general, the i5 processor keeps things moving and 8GB of RAM is just fine for MS Office, web browsing and light photo and video editing work.As far as the externals are concerned, the keyboard is a full-sized chiclet keyboard for the letters and home area. The keys travel as expected, but I couldn't type my fastest on this keyboard, just because the feel was a little off. It's completely functional, but I could only hit maybe 85-90% of my max typing speed on it. However, as a nice bonus, you do get a number pad, but you'll have to get used to the skinny number keys for filling in spreadsheets. I'd still always rather have a number pad, even if the keys are skinny, though. The touchpad, much like the rest of this computer, is functional and ok. There's nothing fancy about it, but it has a decent feel and the left and right clicks aren't too bad. Again, totally functional. There is also a finger print reader on the right side that works fairly well, but alternatively, you can use the webcam and Windows Hello to unlock your device with your face. The left side of the laptop has a VGA port (great for use at older podiums that haven't been upgraded), vents for heat dissipation, an HDMI port, an ethernet port, and 3 USB 3.0 ports. The right side has a laptop lock slot, a headphone jack and a USB 2.0 port. The front has a full-sized SD card slot that has a solid spring-loaded eject mechanism. Also on the right side is a DVD-RW drive. I love that you get a full suite of ports (Displayport notwithstanding) so you'll never have to compromise or bring adapters.The USB ports worked well, and the 3.0 ports do indeed give you SS transfer rates when using 3.0 thumb drives. I used the HDMI port to hook up to my monitor and it gave me 1080p HD with absolutely no lag or problems. You should be able to carry a higher resolution if you have the right HDMI cable and a 4K monitor (I do not have one and couldn't test it).Overall, this laptop performs very well for it's reasonable price. So why 4 stars instead of 5? Well, it's because you will have to make some compromises.First, the DVD drive is loud. Even if you don't have any discs in the drive, on start up this thing cranks and grinds for maybe 20 seconds. In a quiet office, everyone will hear it. The other thing that is sort of a bummer is the screen. It's 1920 x 1080p, and it isn't blurry or anything. But the viewing angles are a challenge. You only get a very narrow 10 degree angle where you'll see decent colors. And it isn't exceptionally bright or vibrant at any angle. I had to jack the brightness up to the 90 or 100% mark under almost all circumstances. The screen also has a substantial bezel on all sides. Considering this laptop is roughly half the cost of a comparable i5 Surface Pro, Spectre, or XPS 13, you will quickly realize that ASUS was able to set the budget prize largely by sacrificing screen quality. Again, fitting with the theme of this device, it's totally functional, but it's not premium. Next, at over 5 pounds, you'll notice the weight for sure. You do get a DVD drive and a bunch of ports, but the budget price comes with a hefty weight compromise. And finally, I notice that this laptop is being marketed for business and productivity. I think that is an ideal usage for this device, however, just be aware that it comes with Windows 10 Home and not Pro or Enterprise. You'll be limited what your IT department can do with this device unless you pay for the Windows download and upgrade.Even with those negative or compromising aspects of this laptop, I can only knock it down to 4 stars because you do truly get a lot for your money here. If you're on a budget but still need to get serious work done, this ASUS P-Series laptop will meet pretty much all of your needs. And if you spend a decent amount of time hooking it up to a monitor, you'll overcome the biggest shortcoming - the screen.
I opened my brand new laptop which arrived from Amazon today (not a 3rd-party seller, sold by Amazon.com). After booting, I get to the "Hi there" screen. However, after selecting my choices, the computer goes into "Just a moment" and reboots, black screen with Asus logo. I get sent back to the "Hi there" screen. This continues in an infinite loop. Computer is unusable. Contacted Asus support, Google search suggests unlicensed copy of Windows 10 (no license # on the back of laptop).
Im giving a 2 star because the laptop is fast and efficient but It came with a broken OS that wasn't allowing me to download simple programs like Java, Netbeans, and Chrome. I was forced to do a clean install of the operating system which was a big inconvenience. If your buying the laptop from here, expect some problems.
Good very basic business pc. Has minimum amount of RAM for Windows 10 Home. Would not use this one for gaming but good for watching movies and general office work. Only gripe would be to have a higher grade Windows 10 included.
I would give 0 stars. Got this as a gift and it will not work. Just an endless loop of choose language/preferences and then shut down. Spent an hour with tech support trying to reset and reboot with no improvement. So basically a $500.00 paperweight. Tech support said this is "just a fluke and bad luck," so take your chances if you like wasting time and money.
Wish I could give negative stars for this piece of garbage. Had it for 2 months, took 20 minutes to start up today and the Cortana feature isn't working. Of course it's past the return date so I'm stuck with the piece of sh@#.
With an SSD installed it's been running very fast. It has good battery life (not great), and a nice keyboard. The screen is of lesser quality compared to the rest of the hardware and will make you want to adjust the angle a few times in one sitting. I have had a couple of blue screens out of nowhere that my previous PC (Dell) did not have. Maybe with a driver update that will get fixed. Also probably driver related is the occasional inability for Chrome to use the default microphone/headset for things like Hangouts. Again, my previous PC did not have this problem.
This is a good-for-the-price budget laptop, but has some functionality issues, as far as I'm concerned.Let me get a few things out of the way right now so that you can skip this review if it isn't appropriate for you. First, we are a primarily-Mac household. Second, we aren't gamers. If you are Windows-only, or gamers, etc., you can ignore a lot of my criticism because I'm just coming from a different perspective from you.When offered this laptop as part of the Vine program, I accepted because it is always nice to have another computer around as a floater. Guests don't always travel with a computer, and this way, they don't just have to rely on their phones or tablets. Besides, another screen never hurts to have around. Like I said, though, we are mostly Mac users, and not gamers. I'll spare you a recounting of the technical specifications because you can look those up elsewhere. At $500, you are pretty much getting a bargain on computing power here-- no arguments from me on that.Set-up was fussy, though, and while I haven't timed operations, simple tasks like start-up, or even opening up Chrome for some simple web-browsing just take longer on this than on a 3-year-old MacBook Pro that I've been beating into the ground. The track pad just doesn't respond like it does on a Mac, and I miss the multi-functionality that you get with a Mac's track pad. The button is stickier too. All of this adds up to a less pleasant user experience. (Yes, Mac's trackpad allows everything you can do with a PC two-button mouse, so quit whining about that).Are these nit-picks? Yup. Absolutely. This is a $500 laptop with a 2.5 GHz processor and I'm whining about the trackpad and Chrome loading slowly because I don't like Windows. I'm THAT guy...The display isn't the best, but you know what? You can send a 1080p signal somewhere else. We even ran it through our projector to play a blu-ray when our blu-ray player got annoyed with us. So, as a floater computer, this thing did its job for us. Again, it's $500.MacBook Pros currently start at $1300. This is $500. I'm being a jerk by pointing out that the trackpad is better on the Mac, and that the ASUS starts up more slowly. Oh, and the Macs no longer come with built-in optical drives. This is a more sensible, budget-conscious machine. It just doesn't give you the same user experience.I'm a jerk. I know. No, I don't have a man-bun or wear skinny-jeans, but thanks for asking.
Valid Laptop
Very Slow and it takes almost 3 min to open or load something
Battery stopped holding charge after only 2 month.
Great work laptop. Good value for price.
The laptot is good, moving fast.Very dissapointed, the DVD-rom is not eject. I did open it in the end but does not close the tray when you put a disk inside.
I have only used this laptop for 2 months and has started giving problems. The screen changes color to white until you can not see a thing. How long is the warranty?
So far so good - it is not a laptop with bells and whistles, but is absolutely fine for internet, Word-based projects and saving photos, music, etc. For what it is and what it offers, not too shabby!!
J'adore cet ordinateur! Fonctionne trÃ¨s bien et ergonomique.
Good Laptop, I use for my personal stuff and for gaming, on gta 5 I get about 30 - 35 on low setting, on other games I get about 50 -100.
Nice, comfortable laptop. Haven't used it much yet, but allready seems to be an outstanding purchase.
So far, a great laptop. Put Bitdefender on it, works great. Way better than my old Toshiba.
A business standard laptop with Windows 10 Home? This is a joke right?
Very satisfied with the purchase. Excellent ! Thank you !!
Reprehensible product. I bought this computer specifically to take the BAR exam 2 weeks before the test, and installed nothing but the test software on it. The computer crashed the day of the bar and hasn't worked since. I would not recommend this computer for any purpose, it could not properly function in the extremely limited capacity I bought it for.
A steaming pile of garbage for the price it's out right now never connect to the Internet open Internet explore when I don't want it to is super glitchy and slow get viruses like every three weeks this is your only warning
Amazon recommends this computer for business but it has Windows home which can't be used on a business network. Buy this if you want to return it because it's not going to be useful for what you bought it for.
I wouldn't know if this laptop would Ser v e my purposes or not, I have been locked out of it since the second day I've had it. When I finally had time to call who I thought was Microsoft to be able to get help, it turned out to be some jokers who wanted Wal-Mart gift cards in the amount of $300 for a new Windows 10 program because mine had crashed. 5 minutes later they said I had been hacked, no I just need my account unlocked by Microsoft!!Maybe then I can write a positive review on this laptop.
No dedicated graphics card. Bye.
It looks just like new, works like a new one, just the warranty is shorter. I often have purchased refurbs and have always been satisfied, just make sure it is a factory refurb.
Excellent laptop. First time using the Chrome operating system and it is a very clean running OS. My 8yr old uses it and it's easy enough for him to navigate through. No lag, instant start up, and does not freeze. Highly recommended.
The package arrives fast and well protected. Right out of the box it took only a few minutes to set up everything. Nice chromebook for my family daily use at a reasonable price. My wife loves it for online browsing, email, video and social media, etc. So far we have been very satisfied with it.
It's touchscreen, it's lightweight, it runs Google Play apps, it's fairly fast, what's there not to like? I'm not sure if you can download everything from the web, but being able to go on all websites you can go on, on a PC and ALSO download mobile apps for this price range? VERY worth it. Even if it's labeled refurbished, it doesn't freeze like my windows 10 hp. Love it!
It works perfect. Highly recommended.
My niece loves it
Order this and when it got delivered it was not as described this was not a touch screen Chromebook like it says in the description!!!It was also very glitchy and not working accurately stay away from HP products they are no good this is the third HP product that I have bought and returned because due to lack of performance and defects definitely not worth buying
Love it!!!
Bought this as a gift to my friend so she could blog. She loves it
So far so good. Started up and using almost right from the box.
Very efficent.Very good response
Not what I expected. Slow even with 2 windows or tabs open. Battery life is not as long as noted. Maybe a good kids first pc but other than punching buttons it is too slow and freezes all the time.
works great for what its needed for
Not bad for refurbished.
My daughter loves it, continues school work at home.
This item was not what I expected it was in bad shape and didn't charge the battery after I charge it for 2 hours it look very old and scratches all over, I'm very disappointed.
Really easy to set up was skeptical at first because of the price but i absolutely love it definitely recommend it
HDMI doesn't work. Need to return.
Works perfectly
Great, as Advertised, works great.
Received today, returning tomorrow. It's slower than my 8 year old HP. Really horribly slow.
So, it's not a bad computer. It is slightly annoying to not have a clear separation of the "left and right click" bar beneath the "mouse pad"...Overall, the computer is lightweight, a little slow on the boot up, but looks clear and sharp. The sound is good, but it is still pretty slow in comparison to what I'm used to with my work computer. However, this computer is for my husband rather than me, and he really enjoys it. He isn't the most computer literate and I suppose from his stand point, anything is better than nothing. I've owned Dell Laptops in the past, but for some reason, I've had better luck with my Lenovo and HP.
worked great for literally 1 day then slowed down to a dead crawl. Don't waste your time or your money on this.
New laptop broken cd drive. Computer completely froze. Returned.
Just what I wanted. Works great.
I love this new computer! First new computer in 10 years. It set very easy to my previous Dell. And my last Dell was a little workhorse. I have not better expectations for this one.
My wife really enjoys the computer. She uses it for her schooling, job, and Facebook. If your a gamer though it's not good for gaming.
Very good to be use for every one.....The keyboard don't just have backlight on it.... But all things on it work perfectly.
Itâs terribly very slow!!! So annoying
Great computer.Great price!
Love it!
very slow
I have purchased Dell products for many years because I require their ease of use and dependability. However, this model is the exception. It was slow from the beginning but on day 35 of the 30 day return policy it downshifted into low gear and now barely works at all. Will not respond to links and basic commands. Lesson learned: my next laptop will be an iPad!
I normally do not write a review, but had to on this one. The laptop is very slow. Stay away! Turned it on once. Comes with standard software. Tried browsing internet for a 30 minutes and the laptop kept clocking away to glory. Got tired, wrapped it up in the box and paid for return shipping and sent it back.
Bought this laptop yesterday and returning it as soon as I can!!! Complete waist of my time setting it up could not print or run my Silhouette Studio program properly. This will be the last Dell product I buy.
Best lap top I've owned. Very easy to get started and have very few issues with it compared to other computers I've had. Love windows 10. I will probably only buy Dell computers in the future. Thank you
As the keyboard, ease of updating, and computer speed are very important characteristics for a computer, I opted to reset the HP to factory condition and returned it, and ordered the Dell Inspiron 1550 instead.I needed to replace two ASUS laptops that were manufactured back when they had a well-earned reputation for keyboard and display 'issues.' My partner wanted the Dell Inspiron 1550, and I thought I'd try this HP being half a pound lighter and except for the fingerprint scanner on the Dell, had the same processing power. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like the more lightweight laptop, it was simply junk compared with the Dell which was only about $20 more expensive. The display on the HP was grainy, the Dell HD. The HP has a mic, the Dell has stereo mics. Dell has a great fingerprint scanning option, the HP did not. The keyboard on the Dell had easy to read and well-spaced keys, with or without the backlight. The HP's keys were difficult to distinguish from one another, with the light from underneath being brighter than the keys, and very narrow spacing between them.Last, the breaking point that had me stop setting up the HP, was that with each required update, the Dell was consistently twice as fast and each update was easily accomplished. Several updates on The HP, for some reason, kept completely failing, requiring extra hours for the update.
GREAT COMPUTER. SPEEDY AND EASY SET UP. LOVE THE BACKLIT KEY BOARD AND THE TOUCH SCREEN OPTION!!
Came preloaded with bloatware. Some security app said there were 447 critical issues that needed to be addressed and asked for a credit card to do it. Had an outdared version of Dropbox with no clear way to update.After using the built in facility to reset to PC to bare Windows 10, it's working well with software I actually want.
Seems like a solid laptop. Basically what I was looking for a a good price: Quad core processor, touch screen, backlit keyboard, good amount of RAM and storage for streaming media and begin entry level programming. Also Bluetooth and Windows 10 is a plus. Minor games just for fun seem to be running alright as well. All of the other laptops I compared to at this price did not have ALL of these features so I felt this was the best value.The only cons of this laptop seem to be the battery life seems a little low, roughly just over 3 hours while I am multitasking different windows and apps, but maybe I need to play more with the battery saver, and it does seem to charge pretty quickly. Also I don't like the speakers being on the front/bottom of the laptop, when the laptop is actually being used on my lap, the speakers are a little muzzled.The speakers could be a little louder, as I like to blast my music loud, and when placed on my lap or a pillow or the couch or anything not a hard surface the sound could be restricted.
My reason for a three is that the first day it worked ok and the next I could not e ven sign in, Had to recover the whole system which took over three hours and shows they ha ve poor quality control, Yes works fine now and is a good computer,
I had a cheap Lenovo and knew I had to replace it as the pointer was uncontrollable and frequently changed pages. I go through computers usually once a year, but there is always a family member to inherit my old ones. So I struggled along for a year with the Lenovo and finally got this Hp onAmazon's sale day. But I'm sure it hasn't changed the price much if at all. What this HP has is stability, a backlit keyboard, and a touchscreen, all of which the Lenovo didn't have. I don't store huge amounts on the computer. Most of what I want is in the cloud or on a jump drive(for backup). So I have all I need in this HP. I have actually bought lots of HPs & been happy with all of them. Since I run a small business it's easier to just format them yearly and give them to someone in the family who needs it . Then I just have to upload a few programs and work in the cloud.
Laptop arrived on time. Packaging is smart and protective. HP got this one right. After letting the battery charge. Booted up the Windows 10 install. Hp streamlined it to a extent. Cleaned up the unneeded programs. Less bloatware than experience in the past. I5 processor is very good quality. Appearance and design is very practical and advanced. Surprisingly lightweight. Yet a sense of being a durable product. HP and Trivalley this is a very good laptop. Thank you.
Everything with the order process went perfect, and it actually arrived a day early. After opening and setting everything up I realized the keyboard did not have a backlight, nor a way to turn it on. On top of that the number pad didn't work. I called HP tech support and they told me the model of computer didn't come with a backlight, so that was false advertising on Amazon's part, and there wasn't anything they could do about the Number Pad. So I Packaged it back up, and shipped it away, I don't want a broke brand new laptop
Great laptop, got all I needed and a bargain price too
It looks great but i could never finish upgrading the system as soon as I got it. It was the slowest machine I have never had, and my last one was a dell machine I bought on 2008. It took to long to turn on by a 2018 standard. The battery was at 43 percent after fully charged after 1 and 1/5 time of looking it up. Disappointed I returned it right away.
OK to good. I agree with others that itâs loaded with bloatwear that slows the performance. The screen, while adequate, is underwhelming. That said, I love the keyboard, and it is fairly lightweight for the size. It suits my relatively simple needs just fine without breaking the budget.
Sorry but this is the slowest computer that I have owned. About 6 years ago I actually found a MacBook air on the side of the road, honestly, that must have been left a cars roof and blew off. But that being said it's 6 years older and 5 times faster than this one.
I purchased 2 of these. One for my granddaughter heading to college and one for me. We both love them and the many different things you can do. I do miss the Microsoft Office features I got so used to on my desktop computer. It is a great computer. Love it.
Love this laptop - Illuminated keyboard is superior to others!
A very nice laptop that my son is taking to college with him.
Iâm in love with this laptop! Iâve always been a Mac user but wanted to give Windows a try. I mostly use it for school, itâs everything I need and more. Itâs fast & efficient. The touchscreen works great, and I also really like the design. The laptop is not that heavy at all and pretty sleek, and the battery life lasts a long time which is a bonus for me. I recommend this to everyone.
My only quibble about this laptop is the battery seems to run down a little faster than I expected. A minor disappointment.
Excellent machine for the price. I don't care much for windows 10 wish Microsoft would sop messing up good products.
Superb touchscreen laptop for the price: excellent value! Terrific specs for this price range! And the gray textured case is great, too - classy and does not show fingerprints in the least. I am very pleased with this high-value purchase!
I absolutely LOVE this laptop. I received this quick and the setup was very easy. It's been while since i have used a laptop and it feels great to have picked something as awesome as this. I will be updating to a Solid State drive in the future, but for now this laptop works pretty quick. GREAT PRODUCT!
It comes with all u could ask for. Runs very efficent but it does run slow at times because of HDD but can b easily fixed if replaced with SSD!
You get what you pay for... inexpensive but functional. No issues.
works OK. Had trouble getting the updates completed. After updates work ok.
Just received my computer and it is NOT the computer listed. No touch screen and looks nothing like the pictured computer. I received a pro book 450.
this is so so nice. thank you.
This is a good machine. The updates are extremely slow so there is minus a star for that. It runs good, can handle basic multitasking really well. The battery life is superb, first time I have had a computer that will let me run it all day without having to be plugged in.
All is great with this laptop except the hard drive. The hard drive is so slow, that the 8 GB's of ram, and 4-core intel i5 processor have no opportunity to be utilizied. I uninstalled all of the bloatware, and installed advanced systemcare pro to optimize the system. I can't do much of anything without reaching 100% disk usage, freezing windows explorer. I will be replacing the hard drive with an SSD drive, but between the drive and purchasing a copy of windows 10, that is going to add another $300 on top of the price of the laptop just to get it to run without freezing.
I love this laptop very nice and fast what else could I say? It has everything I wanted even DVD player
Great! Does what I need for Voice Over work.
Sleek design and so far so good out of the box. Ran a little slow out of the gate, but tried a different WiFi feed and it works like a charm. No issues but this is day 2.
So far it is living up to my expectations. This is my first computer purchase.
You get a lot of computer for the money, it has the one of the latest processors, a large heard drive and decent ram. The only thing a didn't like was the outside cases looks cheap.
Sold a laptop damage. It Does not works. The purchase was a fraud
It didnât work at all even being plug on. Maybe it was defent so I ordered another one and hopefully it will work.
Great laptop and very good experience so far. I received the product same as described on site. Also a good services and received it just in two days. I am a happy customer.
In the key board few buttons are not working properly
color is different than pic but works just great!
Works perfectly out of the box. Matt finish is nice - NO fingerprints and smudges
I like how fast it is Shipping was great and it is everything that the seller said it was. I would order one again
The system is very slow, it takes almost 10 minutes to start every time I open it. So now I am thinking of returning it back.
Like it
Battery only lasts about two hours. Tech service is poor at best, problem was never resolved
Awesome, responsive solid machine for the price
this is the second hp laptop i have purchased in the last month.the first was for my daughter for christmas it never worked AT ALL.sent it back. gave you a second chance the second on was the same piece of junk.TEC SUPPORT CANNOT FIX PROBLEM.IF i were you i would not sell HP TRASHI am a loyal amazon customer but this makes no senseMY daughter still doesn't have a christmas presentYOU will be receiving it back shortlyPLEASE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WITH HP
VERY POOR BATTERY TIME TEXTURE IS REALLY BAD
Item was perfect. Now if only we could do something about bloatware, (which was minimal but any is to much).
I just ordered this after finally ditching my old laptop. It's fast and adaptable. Windows 10 works great too. The back lit keyboard helps a ton since I do a lot of typing at night, I don't need a lamp on to see the keyboard anymore.
This product IS NOT as described in the posting. This laptop computer does not have a "backlit keyboard" as described. I received the computer and did not realize until I had already completed the initial computer setup. It would be a bigger burden for me to return the computer to factory settings, repackage the item, submit for return, have it shipped back, and wait for my money back than it would be for me to just continue using it with my discontent.
charged with custom and tax omg in the end paid 897.72 in total so much for 591 deal lol.and this computer is bare bone i cant even do a face reorganization only good thing about is its new and intel 8th gen i7 thats all there is
Great product for a great price.
Stay with Intel not AMD
Este tipo es un ladron
Very nice experience
I have had this laptop for 2 months. I absolutely love it. I did change out the hard drive for a SSD drive.(it uses a standard size)Pros: nice size, light, touch screen, 8th generation i7 processor, battery life, DVD drive(i don't use it but it doesn't hurt to have it) replaceable batteryCons:Not illuminated keyboard, not SSD drive, hard to find parts for even on HP website.
Had this for two days. I gave it a shot, but I will be returning it. Maybe I got a lemon, but this laptop is SOOOOOOO SLOOOOWWWW. Its like being on a dial up connection, even when right next to the router. Web pages like yahoo take 60+ seconds to load - and sometimes drops the webpage. HD display? Doesn't look like it to me. My webcam feed on this thing looks like something off of a 1970's tube TV; websites are not much better. And after a minute or so, it gets so hot I can feel it if it's on my lap. I know this isn't even a mid-range laptop in terms of processor/memory/hard drive, but come on. It's 2018. Even a bottom of the barrel laptop should have much better performance than this thing. I have had HP products in the past with no complaints, and will try HP in the future. Like I said, maybe this one is a lemon, but if this is what the true performance of this laptop is supposed to be like, I would only recommend as a first laptop for children.
It was extremely slow. I have the fastest internet available and all of my devices worked well except for this. It went in and out and on power up sometimes it just sat on a black screen. Sent it back as soon as I could I was so unhappy with this purchase.
I was excited first. Then when I opened the box, the laptop box was damaged and the laptop screen was all cracked and was dysfunctional when it came on
Too slow and it overheat fast
Super slow and super cheap. You get what you pay for. Giving it away to my younger cousin for his first year of college. I HATE this thing!
Awesome sauce!!
I am unsure if it is Windows 10 or the laptop, but this unit is extremely slow. Even after watching YouTube videos on how to increase it's speed by removing junk programs, it is still slow. I would recommend buying another laptop.
I bought this computer a month ago and I love it!! It is simple and easy to set up. At first I was afraid I bought the screen too big (I got the 17") but it is perfect when writing a paper and doing research. I can have two windows open at the same time and easily read both screens. The speed of it is fast and I have never had a frustrating moment with it. I'm in nursing school so I use it daily for several hours at a time. Perhaps my only small complaint is the charge doesn't hold as long as some computers I've used in the past, it will still last several hours but within a few hours it's going dead. Also the fan in it is sometime a little noisy, it never last long, but the first time it did it in class I just thought it was a little loud. Overall I'm very happy I purchased this computer and didn't spend a fortune. It makes school work so much easier!! I definitely would recommend this laptop to anyone!!
I love the computer, but this is the 2nd computer I bought from Amazon that I had to completely reset and reinstall Windows because it came to me all jacked up. Amazon sells some decent computers but I'm learning to just reset and reinstall as soon as I receive it.
UPDATEMost of the performance issues were caused by Windows 10 update problems. It took me over 12 hours of computer cycling and Tool download and launch to get Windows clear out faulty updates and repair the process. Then it spent most of the day downloading and updating. Once that was all done, the computer now works reasonably well. HP tech support was quick and found the problem, so I give them good marks. The computer is still a little slow for my taste, but I am updating my rating from 1 star to 3 Stars because it is adequate for the price.Original reviewThe SLOWEST pig of a laptop ever. I tried to disable or uninstall all the hog programs, and the performance is insanely poor. I am a week to late to return it, I may try and have it "repaired". It locks up multiple times. Today it acted like it was updating Windows on three straight power down cycles. No update, but spun on the blue screen for 10 minutes or more each time.UNACCEPTABLE.
I've had this for one month. It just SHUTS OFF for no reason! I missed the return window by one day. Very Unhappy.This laptop bites! DO NOT BUY!
I have had this computer for about 2 months. So far it has exceeded my expectations. I use it for work and run it alongside another monitor. It has been able to keep up with multiple programs running with no issues.
Just got on this new HP and will have to say that they just keep getting better. This is my 3rd one and the finest one yet. So good looking and it has Bluetooth. Way cool and at a great price.
This laptop sucks so bad itâs so slow itâs been only a few days, I thought it would improve but itâs worse, do not buy this!
I was replacing an older laptop. Great laptop for the price.
Okay for The Money
Not good at all, only screen was adequate. Returned.
It does the job!
super fast. great unit
Easy setup, good quality monitor...Over all ..,.5 THUMBS UP!!
I had just got the laptop yesterday from the mailing company and the laptop ran fine while I was using it by my parents house. When I got home it was like I had owned the laptop for 5 years and have several viruses and spyware on it. It took forever to start up during which time the fan got really loud. When the desktop finally came up it took forever for everything to start. Typing was delayed by at least 2 seconds. It became unbearable to use so I decided to wipe the hard drive clean and install a fresh copy of windows 10 64-bit. Of course I installed all of the necessary drivers. But then I notice while I was playing a movie that the sound was choppy I figured maybe it was the video file. I was wrong everything I played from any site or on the VLC player I installed every couple of minutes the sound would come off choppy for about 8-11 seconds. Now the other problem I noticed was the I was not getting the 5 GHz signal from the wireless options even though in the description it says that this laptop is wireless 802.11 b/g/n. I of reset my router and modem and still nothing. My iPhone and my wife's $250 Lenovo laptop which she has owned close to two years now runs faster than this laptop and can pick up the 5 GHz signal so I know its not a router issue. This is probably a factory defect or something. The laptop runs faster now that it has a fresh copy of windows installed but still sluggish for a new laptop and also the audio is choppy along with me not being able to pick up the 5 GHz signal from my Linksys router. I am highly disappointed in this product if you are looking for a laptop look elsewhere and save yourself the head ache. This is actually the 1st review I have ever written for a product I just had to express my disappointment.Update: I contacted HP about the wireless issue and it turns out that this model is not dual band so 5GHz will not show as a wireless option. You will have to purchase a wireless usb dual band adapter if you want the 5 GHz signal.
Just horrible. Slow, crashes all the time, and generally just a horrid computer. Stay far away
All ok
This was unbelievably slow and faulty. The software was a mess and should have never been sent out.
This laptop is the best one I've ever owned. It fits all my needs. It's a great one.
Windows 10 takes a while to learn and isn't as user friendly as 7.
Just perfect for someone who doesn't need a disk drive. It's light and small- so easy to carry with me.
I needed something small for school and note taking. This is just the thing, it's not fancy, it's simple and gets the job done. Getting adjusted to the keyboard without caps was not easy, but I discovered you can make the search button the capd lock on settings. The price is something that can't be beat!I had originally given a 4 star review but I am not liking that for a few times now the screen will turn off and then turn back on when I am using it.
This is not as fast as a laptop but is completely functional for what I need it for. This is the 3rd one I have purchased. (the others were gifts) and I am very happy with the chromebook for what I needed it for. I use it mostly to update a blog, check emails, shop, etc. I love how thin and light it is.
Samsung always rocks. This was for a 7 year old and so far so good. Same thing they use in school.
Got this as a refurb for a non-geek client who just needs it to be a working tool...so far so good. I am loving ChromeOS, so easy to learn and support. Folks spend more time in browsers than anywhere else and having something that mostly lives in the cloud helps to avoid backup procedures, supports versioning of documents and is easy to support. Essentially, we're back to remote terminals...and it's a good thing.But none of that's about this Chromebook, which is pretty doggone nice. The regular old HDMI jack is a plus...though I think Chromebooks all ought to use the new USB/C standard for charging, like most this one doesn't...and the simple power plug is easy to insert...unlike say a directional microUSB. The battery lasts all day, it's quiet and fast...
Awesome chromebook! My daughter needs to work on her google assignments and send them to her teacher, so I decided to try this for her. She is 11 and itâs perfect for what she needs. She also plays games and I have used it to edit pictures and make videos. LOVE it!!!
This is exactly what I was looking for. It's lightweight, compact. I opened the box, turned it on and within minutes I was logged in (using my wifi password and google account log in). It's basic. But it serves my needs perfectly (web browsing and google drive are all I need). There isn't a caps lock button, so it's going to take some time for me to get used to pressing alt and search. I'm hoping there is a shortcut to this. (I just got it last night). Highly recommend if you are looking for a, as my husband called it, a 'phone w a larger screen and a keyboard'. Again, perfect for my needs.Edit / I discovered that you can make the search key a short cut for other options. I selected mine to be caps lock and now I love this Chromebook even more.
It won't show my Google photos and it really puts a damper when I'm trying to post for dogs to get adopted and my pictures are not loading..
No Bluetooth function. Scrolled is a nightmare
Great Love using chrome fastest computer I have ever used.
fantastic cheap option for a student laptop
Taking into consideration the limitations of a Chromebook, it does everything it is supposed to do and the battery lasts a long time.
Comouter takes forever to load after less than a week of use. Keys have to be pressed harder than normal to type. Dont get this if you type fast or light. Messes up all of my assignments for school so i have to type the same sentence like 3 times to get it all the way.
This is a great laptop and I use it a lot! If you are not an Apple guy, I just don't understand why anyone would want to buy anything more expensive because if you don't do anything but surf the web, you really don't need anything more.I watch Netflix and Amazon Prime on this thing. Plus, I can use this with an HDMI monitor or TV.
Came with no Operating System
Works Great..I got it for my girls for Christmas :)
LOVE LOVE LOVE my laptop! It runs smooth, works well with the internet and I like the Google Docs feature. As a college student, it works for me!
Good value in a cheap Chromebook. If you want to try a Chromebook without putting out a lot of money, this is for you. Highly recommend.
Initially I was happy with this product. However, after having it for 5 months it no longer takes a charge. We have tried a variety of other chargers but none have helped. The laptop itself/battery must not be any good- after only 5 months of light use, this is very disappointing. Buyer beware.
I loved this laptop...it was recently stolen and even though i never got it back google does a good job at letting you know whats up!! I'd definitely buy this again! I used it 99% of the time for streaming movies.
I love this chromebook. Easy to set up and easy to use.
Was worth $150.Everything was great or worth the money, besides the keyboard (it sucks)Laptop never slowed down on me. and works as well as a core i3 from 3 years ago
My son love it
great computer, as long as you only want to steam tv/YouTube or do homework.
I have owned this chrome book for about a year now. I love it!! Easy to carry around and use. Charges quickly and runs fast. The price was an absolute steal. Very happy with my purchase!!
I've only had it for a few days, but I've gotten so much done on it. I'm using it for online classes and I love it! When my chromebook arrived, it looked brand new. I was skeptical about ordering it because I've had issues with refurbished products in the past from local stores, but this product is amazing. Definitely worth the money!
Nice design but a bit slow for simple tasks like surfing the web
works fine - we use it for netflix.
works as described. looks brand new! I am overall very happy with this product and would recommend to anyone that uses it for browsing
Less than six weeks owned and already broken. Will not turn on.
Refurbished? I couldn't even tell... My grandson loves it & now his brother has to have one...
Looks great feels great but however it didnât boot up what a let down as I needed the chrome book ASAP for a class Im teaching
In the beginning it worked great but now it crashed and all the kids did was use it for homework! Very bad product
The product worked fine for a week before a screen glitch and line appeared on the display.
If you are not on the internet most times, basically useless
it came earlier than expected and it works perfectly fine for right now?
No problems
Not bad for the price
Great product works extremely well
This is good for my kids homework
For the price I can't complain
everything i need inatablet
Great thanks
This chromebook is 100 percent perfect.
I love it and the price was great.
Nice and o love it thank you so much ð
Grate buy
Great product
I'm not a tech savvy guy, but I needed something bigger than my smartphone to conduct banking business online. I thought this was the perfect device. It's not as easy to download apps as my old tablet or my phone. And it is on the slow side. But I got it on sale so for the price i paid i am not totally disappointed.
The laptop loaded right up and allowed me to create a profile no issues. After turning it off and returning to it about an hour later, I would log in and it would begin to load my profile, then just go blank for a second and return me back to the log in screen repeatedly. Returned it immediately, first and last time ever getting a refurb.
Took a chance on purchasing a somewhat unknown computer system to replace a lost iPad. Surprised at how user friendly and flexible is the Chromebook system.Now I understand why this machine (11" Chromebook) is pretty well the standard for lower grades school use. I'll go for a refurbished bargain again, as well.
Bought two for my daughters. Very similar to what their schools provide.As they can't take the school Chromebooks home, these are very handy to have.Also got one for my wife and I!
sending is back since it doesnt work when picked up. works fine if left on a desk or table, but when you pick it up, the screen dies and the unit shuts down. oh well, I'll be looking for another one.
short learn curve, I like it a lot
Amazing my dream computer
exceeded all expectations, especially for the price I paid for it.
The product wouldn't power up
Great chromebook
Trouble displaying websites
Perfect on the go laptop.
I love it works great.
Not good
It's simple and easy to use. Fits my needs.
This product stopped working after only two months. Not acceptable.
cheapest but cheapest
Works great. On it right this second. I would purchase this again.
If I could rate this as a zero I would. It wouldn't let me go to common websites like Netflix, Amazon, and other sites.
Good for price.
Well i cant get internet. Wtf?! Reset my password with my phone and cant really do anything with this with no internet. About to have some words with these folks...
Arrived DOA
My parents love it!
I gave it to my son who is going to school. Because of the compact and size I will probably buy one for myself later on. It seems to fit his needs
There are very few aps for this device. if you try to download something like minecraft for the kids its not compatible. even virus protection is impossible.... they have "safe site" aps but no true virus protection. my son had this less than a month and already has a virus. I thought this would be good for a kid with all the android aps. but i strongly recommend getting a different computer!!!
Let me start with the important things . It got here fast , it came with a charger and it works and looks brand new and it came with the original charger. I was so scared to get a broken or half working laptop. I'm from South America (suriname) so returning a non working product isn't easy.
I enjoy it so much
Absolutely perfect for what it is intended to do. Simple, and connects to Wi-Fi very quickly.
Everything has been working out for me . :)
Es la mejor
This is a PIECE OF JUNK !
I decided to buy another HP to replace my current HP. When I started looking for a computer I was looking at metal chassis machines for durability. I travel a lot and use my computer on planes, trains, in coffee shops, malls, and sometimes in my office. I have had my current HP for 7 years and it has always performed nicely. I bought a Lenovo 3 years ago as a replacement because my HP was starting to slow down and I am impatient. The screen developed a line across it just after a year. Multiple screws fell out of the case and it started getting buggy. I switched back to my HP and it performed without any problems. The more I researched the more I went back to HP.When I received the package the outer box was undamaged but the original box the computer was packed in had significant damage and my first thought was I had to return it. The second thought was why would they ship a computer in a box with that much damage. I took pictures and prepared to return the computer. I travel a lot for work and do not spend much time in the United States and the next time I will be in the country is in June of 2018 so I thought if the computer works and is not damaged I will keep it. I took the computer out of the packaging and there were no visible signs of damage. I plugged it in and started it up and everything worked just like it should. Everything is tight with no scratches.The computer is light and looks like it has a metal chassis. It feels solid and not flimsy like some other brands. About 2 hours after I finished setting it up I stepped outside for a minute and my granddaughter pulled the computer off the table onto the hardwood floor. She did not get hit with the computer and my wife quickly moved her to another room and picked up my computer. She was afraid it was broken. After looking the computer over the only damage is to one of the corners. The computer is still solid, and works just fine. I am very happy with it and will look at HP again next time I buy a computer.I timed the battery life and with normal use with no gaming and only light video streaming it lasted more than 8 hours. I expect the time to go down some over time but if I get half the performance I got out of my old HP I expect the battery to last during most of my out of office time and during all but the longest flights.I only gave 4 stars because the damage done to the box. There were three items in the Amazon box when it arrived and this one was in the middle so it was not damaged in transit. It had to be damaged prior to shipping.
So i bought this laptop because my 15â?hp laptop of 6 years died on me. I needed something for college and for movies and lookswise its really nice! It runs great too. But my only complaints is how the touch pad feels, it has that irritating feel that you get when you touch computer paper (if you know what i mean). & the laptop has this noise, like you can hear the laptop running basically. Its not super loud but its noticeable. I bought this to also give a real review on it and to post pictures of how it looks since no one seems to have it on youtube -.-
This computer is sleek in design and very compact. Itâs everything I needed it to be. I have an Ethernet port, micro sd port, and more than enough USB ports. For a small computer, itâs more than I expected and it runs excellent. The i7 is also a big plus! Thanks HP!
It's very nice looking computer. The screen is sharp and the back lit keys are nice. It came with allot of bloatware. It periodically freezes upand sometimes loads slow. I never know when this is going to happen.. It's really a problem when I have to write an email report for my work and it does this. If I can't send a simple email when I need to, what good is it. I don't think I can send this back. I'm just sick about it. My advise is, buy a Dell.
This computer arrived promptly, the box was in excellent condition. I upon opening and turning on the computer for the first time, I had just over 80% battery life left for operating. I noticed that this computer was not exactly crisp with moving window to window and transitioning from one program to another. I need this to multi task for school and although this does the job, I am sad to say it isn't as quick as I was hoping for. For a few hours everything and then windows and other updates were prompting. I started to update programs and had an error with HP accelerometer program. I successfully deleted the program restarted the computer and reinstalled a newer driver edition. NOW everything is running without any issues.The battery life is very disappointing and the fact that HP states 9hrs of operating is just crazy. I have on a full charge been lucky to get 4.5 without the backlit keyboard and with power saving options selected.Overall I do recommend this computer if you are in need of something that is very light weight and easy to carry around, just make sure to bring your charger. I like how it doesn't contain a lot of bloatware that all too many computers to date seem to provide.
First, the keyboard is backlit. Press the F5 key and there you go. Honestly, this is a superb laptop, especially for me. It's fairly light weight, very easy to use, more storage than just about any human could use, a lot of great features. I would have loved to own this thing five years ago. There's nothing cheap or flimsy about it. I read other reviews about a noisy fan, but I'm not hearing it and my hearing is very good. Maybe it was a later improvement on the model? I don't know, but this thing is as silent as it gets. Seriously, this is a very nice computer. Yes, there is no DVD drive, but you can buy one to USB attach for less than $40, so that shouldn't be too big of a deal. And, oh yeah, a very good keyboard. Excellent key feel makes typing very comfortable.
I've been using this laptop for a little over a month now and I'm satisfied. My biggest concern when choosing to buy another HP Pavilion was with overheating but this model stays cool. I love how sleek and light it is and even with all the bloatware it boots quickly. I gave it 4 stars because the battery life isn't as long as I would like but it really isn't bad.
Wasn't standard silver like in the photo but more a goldish silver.Kinda threw me off.So far so good. I love the keyboard. Speaker volume is ok as well.Functions well so far for the purpose.
Very good item, sleek easy to use, very light. Design is very good.Down side bit slow for an i5 from the beginning, also there is this irritating fan/ hard disk spinning noise(like its out of place). Itâs pertinent with all of these model not just with mine thatâs how itâs manufactured I checked it and even other reviews say that.Battery backup is not as expected I think it doesnât even last of what is claimed.
I absolutely love it. The only thing i cannot stand is the sound it makes. I had two technicians that swear it is just the processor that makes that slight weird sound. The computer is great just hate the slight sound. My last HP had a pleasant hum.
This laptop is gorgeous! HP should advertise this hidden gem more, it's a handsome laptop with competitive specs, and a budget price.
Great HP Pavilion Notebook! Works perfect for school, work, and personal use! And it's stylish!ð
I bought it brand new on 1/8/18 and its hard disk failed last week. Now I have to call HP to get it repaired. Terrible quality!
so far so good, will give an update in a year.
Bought for a friend. He is very happy with his new laptop
Great computer for a college student. It has all the memory and speed you need t run multiple programs and is set up for social media. I only wish it had a touch screen
Wow! The amount of preloaded bloat software is ridiculous! Takes hours to uninstall it. If not, your computer runs slow! Agggggg
Good computer
Love it.
Just got the delivery, after waiting for over a week. The packaging was fine but the laptop came with a little dent. As this was not enough, the touch pad from the left size is not leveled with the surface. I did not expected this. Really disappointing.
Great product, good price!
I like it, because it is light and the battery is good.
The computer is great but itâs wifi sucks. It keeps interrupting my work. Also, the fan looks like the computer is running a physical plant energy regenerator. Too much noise for the little mouse;)
Excelente producto!!. Tenia miewo, pues todos los comentarios hacia la marca y hasta del modelo no eran alentadoras. Pero muy buen producto
Excellent. No other product with similar specs is even remotely close to its price. Works perfectly fine & as always the case, wonderful buying experience from Amazon.
Everything is ok... I'd like it has spanish keyboard :(
Excelent performance. Much better than my HP Celeron 14 inches.
Excellent laptop in design and price-quality relation. It arrived shiftly and well protected. It was for my girlfriend and esthetics for some women are also very important and she just loves it. Very satisfied with this HP.The screen quality is something to improve, the resolution is not so great and the camera is also low definition.In general, a very good product.
After 4months of less frequent usage, screen went blank.Dissapointing I must say.
vv good.
Seems slow at times, but it does well for what I need it for.
It's processor is really good
This is everything I wanted in a laptop I love it.
This laptop is really really cool I just love it!
Great deal for the price.
Very good product and worth the money
Speakers don't work.Hard disk running sound.
Just what she was looking for !!!
Itâs awesome.
Itâs Perfect!
Purchased the product Jan 2018 and satisfied, but there are occasional freezes.
The best laptop I ever had it is awesome and the price is amazing.
Buying this laptop was a huge mistake. Within weeks the mouse stopped working completely. I had to send it back to HP for repairs. It's back but it is still much slower than my old laptop (which I replaced because it was so slow). It's very difficult to remove the pre-loaded stuff and you have to update Windows 10 immediately which took nearly 8 hours. I really wish I'd spent a little more money and gotten a reliable, useful laptop.
Nightmare right out of the box way too intrusive with wanting email addresses phone numbers agreeing to participate in Microsoft marketing experiences. Could not get computer to set up and send code via text. Boxed up headed to UPS tomorrow done
At first sight is pretty! but I dont know why the mouse and screen paralized like for 6 seconds and then suddenly starts working again, IT IS STARTING TO WORRY ME,,, when Im watching youtube videos, it paralyzes and I have to close the page... makes me really mad, please... what can I do? I didnt download anything, the first time I turned on it happened!!!!! HELP
I very much like what it offered, it just wouldn't work and it went back yesterday !The windows key on the screen and the keyboard were non existent. Oh, they were there in picture format.. but notan active key. I so wanted to love this laptop..it just didn't work as it should .I will give HP one more chance.. I will reorder when I know my refund has credited to my account.
The hard drive gave out completely after 1.5 years of casual use (no crazy programs or massive data files).
First let me state that I am a Network admin. I received this laptop, and it stated that it has a touchscreen and 1080p screen, it is not touchscreen and it's only 1366X768res. Also the charger that was sent with it is not the right charger for the laptop. I had to use one of my chargers for another laptop I have to charge it enough to see the specs in the BIOS. Not happy, now i have to send it back. Hopefully they can fix the issue.
The laptop was deliver with a bad hinge hence using it was impossible. it began to shutdown after just a week of use. this is my worst purchase on Amazon ever.
The computer came with an old battery that emptied quickly. In addition, a lot of blows in the package from the outside. disappointing
Item was not a touchscreen and did not have backlit
Bought refurbished and should of known that was a mistake. Iâve only used it a handful of times and itâs currently not working. Seemed like a great deal and worked great at first. Now it wonât even turn on. So rule of thumb donât ever buy refurbished electronics regardless of the deal.
I actually just bought my second one of these. I just got it fired up yesterday and loaded it with all my programs, so far so good. I bought one from the same seller earlier in the year but it was stolen while traveling. I liked the old one so much that I bought the exact same one again. Both times I got exactly what was listed on the specs and both computers showed very minimal wear, seemed almost like new.At this price I feel you kindof can't go wrong, and with all the money saved I just bought the 3 year protection plan so if something does go wrong Im covered.Like I said I only just got this one up and running up a couple days ago but so far so good. The other one I was using for 4 months while traveling in Asia with no problems before it was stolen.
The laptop was indicated as: "Certified Renewed product" and: "tested and certified to look and work like new". I received a a heavy used one. The rubber legs are missing, lots of scratches, and the battery is 4-5 years old. No touchscreen and the keyboard backlight is faulty. It's Not a refurbished one but a defective used one cost $100! Seller dissappeared and not responding!
Worked well right out of the box. Had some visible signs of light wear on it, but there was a high quality sticker cover over the top that covered up any sort of irregularities that might've been on the back of the LCD screen. Overall a good product and easy to work with.
I love this computer, And the price is far below all other computers with the same specs. Shipping was fast.I will recommend your company and this computer to anybody that is looking.If all that wasn't enough, it is upgradeable to even higher specs should the need arise.I'm a computer tech, self taught and would do the upgrades myself. Thanks for the great product and price.
Started right up, freshly applied image, was missing a couple screws, but those were easily replaced.
So far working well. I have been using it for about a month. I was not going to pay for a new one. This refurbished Latitude has exceeded my expectations. The battery is long lasting. The charger is genuine Dell.
my favorite thing is that this laptop works. was bought as a replacement for my old laptop that died. the replacement lasted 3 day sthen screen wouldn't stay illuminated. this dell was purchased to replace the replacement. been a couple of weeks and its working just fined.product works. delivered in a timely fashion. pleasure doing business with you
Dear David, you have no idea a how important it is for me to receive your email, I really appreciate it. I bought the computer to bring it to Guatemala and unfortunately the batery is not ok. Its off the part where it should be, I will be traveling back to Los Angeles in 20 days, I can take it back with me if you can change it.
So far, so good. As expected... came with charger and hasnât broken or had battery issues. Surprised. Good deal, great laptop.
Everything was good. But it started heating up so badly. Also, sometimes when I am charging the system got struck.
Worked properly upon imaging and windows updates - will be reusing vendor in the future.
Nice laptop, quick & touch screen is great.
very reasonable for the conf I got
Sucks. Screen falls. Didn't come with Windows 10.
I need assistance with this computer. It is not working, more specifically it is not turning on most of the time. I purchased the extended warranty through Assurant. I don't know how to proceed with getting this computer repaired. Thanks for your assistance.
great little laptop, shows a little wear, but no issues at all!
Product was delivered as ordered and works well
best value I have found in the market place and it fit my needs: speed, storage, window 10 highly recommended.
Great machine for the price. Fast delivery and great condition. Will definitely be ordering this one again when needed.
This is the first time I ever bought a refurbished produck. I am glad I did, so happy about my Dell Latitude E7240 . Definitely much better than what I was expected. Thanks.
Laptop in good condition, even though there were scratches. The laptop did not have the right drivers, but something that can be fixed. All in all am satisfied with the delivery.
Everything works as expected. Runs fast!
The product and lead-time satisfied me.Its export package seems huge for the laptop.It looks 5 times larger than its best size.
This lay top works great. I didnât even have to go through the set up. I opened it and it was ready to use first for what ever I wanted.
We've been very happy with this certified refurbished laptop. It meets our needs and helps us keep our IT costs under control!
To give some background, I purchased this laptop for the purpose of video editing as my only other laptop I owned was a 2012 Acer Aspire. Product arrived exactly as described. You could barely tell it was refurbished other than the 2 very minor scratches along the top, at least on the model I received. The only issue I have had with it was the SD reader not working, but I am sure it has something to do with the drivers. Even so, that is what card readers are for. I could not be any happier with my purchase!
Great machines.
Great Laptop. great speed, All as described in the Ad.
Arrived in great condition and works well.
The laptop is super. Love it. Could not get a better price
Very Happy with the Product. I received the laptop without touchscreen. Laptop itself is in great condition, Looks new. Battery lasts little over 3 hours. Bought this for my son and he is very happy with the laptop
Thatâs crazy excellent!, attaccher is equal to.Th will be touch on we needed. If I board those, you should Me ship to another one(the first = new):
Describing this as "2017" is deceptive since it's a model from 2013.
Windows 8.1 is the operating system. Blazing Prices has now 2 times back-to-back sold me something claimed as Windows 10, but it is not.
I ordered this notebook for my father, the moment he turned it on it would not load windows. After I looked at it, the screen flashed windows 98' then went to a screen stating the volume c had no label and did show a storage amount of 2gb. I thought that maybe that I needed to find the hidden partition on it so I can reformat the notebook. But due to there was windows 98 on it I could not find the hidden partition. This was horrible by and even though it was a recertified item I would figure they would have seen the windows 98 splash screen to show that something was not right with this device. I am really disappointed in this seller and how the information on the product does not match what was described. I am requesting a refund and will not purchase from this seller again.
This fanless laptop performs quite nicely with the new Intel processor inside. Web browsing feels fast and snappy compared to prior generation laptops around this price point. It's funny what a difference a year can make in low end PC performance. 4GB of RAM is good for multitasking.While I like the performance I was disappointed that the laptop has so little storage. 32GB isn't much and it will prevent the installation of more applications. SD cards inserted into the laptop's card reader do not sit flush to the unit making carrying additional storage less convenient.The 14 inch display, while large and at a nice 1080p resolution is a very low quality TN display. If the screen is not positioned properly the image will look washed out or lose its clarity.Video playback is dramatically improved over prior generation hardware and it should have no issues playing back HEVC video : even the high bit rate stuff. I was impressed to see that on a low cost laptop.Overall this isn't a bad deal for the price tag. I would have liked to see more storage but if you're looking for a Windows laptop to run a few applications and spend the rest of your time in the cloud this should be sufficient.
Itâs probably best to start by clarifying what this laptop isnât. It's not a desktop replacement even for an office environment. The 32GB hard drive just isnât enough to operate at the core of your workflow, even if your workflow is mostly spreadsheets. Itâs not a premiere media consumption device, the screen isnât good enough and the speakers leave much to be desired. It certainly wonât be able to handle any gaming outside a very limited sphere of low spec games, even then I wouldnât recommend it. With all that out of the way, what does the Aspire One do a good job at? It can handle office tasks, web browsing, and media consumption.The build quality of the laptop is great for the price point. The keyboard is good and the trackpad is okay. The only major letdown of the actual construction are the enormous bezels around the screen. In 2017, theyâre almost comically large. The screen is also a letdown with terrible viewing angles and colors so off itâs difficult to tell youâve found the right viewing angle even when you try. I understand the prestige the engineers were going for when they offered a full 1080p display on a laptop at this price point, but I would have gladly sacrificed the screen resolution for better colors. One of the only redeeming factors of the screen is its brightness, allowing for usage outside on a clear day, if youâre willing to squint just a bit. The webcam isnât much better, offering just enough definition so that you can safely identify who youâre talking to. The microphone is grainy and canât handle even a slight breeze, though it does compensate for changes in volume very well.When it comes to raw performance the laptop is surprisingly good. Due to the SSD, the boot time is excellent and the tasks it can run with its limited memory are always snappy. The WIFI card is good enough for taking advantage of 30 Mbps plus internet speeds and the Bluetooth pairs quickly. By far the biggest bottleneck with this device is the limited memory. Even when youâre being conscious of your activity, running no more than two office applications at once, be prepared to encounter at least one warning a day from windows about your RAM limitations.PROS:Good ProcessorFast Hard DriveGreat Boot TimeExcellent Battery LifeFull Version of WindowsNo BloatwareCONS:Poor ScreenLimited RamLackluster TrackpadBad SpeakersNoisy WebcamA student might reasonably ask, can I get by on just this laptop? The short answer is yes, but thatâs a bit risky. Even if your major isnât film production and you donât need to edit 4k footage on a daily basis, I still wouldnât recommend it. If you chose to make this laptop the core of your workflow you will be forced to kiss any serious multitasking goodbye, along with large amounts of local storage. Youâll end up keeping close tabs on your files, pushing a lot of them to an external drive or cloud storage. It would be a good idea to pair the laptop with even an entry level desktop or just find a way to get a higher end device. With that said, if you only have two hundred dollars, go for it. Itâll handle all your office tasks.Buying budget products today is filled with uncertainty. Even when an item has the specs to do what you want, thereâs always a lingering anxiety that the day may come when you need it to perform and it will let you done. This is especially true for something like a laptop, the center of the mobile workplace. Despite its price, the Acer Aspire One doesnât disappoint, it handles office tasks well and operates okay as a media consumption device. What more can you ask for the price?
So, this is a honest review on the Aspire 1.The notebook is fast, with the Celeron N3450, browsing, loading speed etc are good. The 4GB RAM plays a nice role here for a budget computer. You can use this notebook to work such as programming, office things and of course for educational purposes if you are a student. This notebook is NOT for advanced image and video editing or 3D thing. In fact, heavy software like Photoshop etc must not be installed. The notebook is too basic for these tools in terms of system requirements. You get Office 365 pre-installed as a trial period. However, I removed it for LibreOffice. Moreover, regarding the screen, it is NOT an IPS display. The display is matt but you can play a little with the saturation if you want. However, I leave it like it is, I do not have any issue. The sound is not that best performance, but it is good. The keyboard is good, responsive.The only ssue is the storage which is a 32GB eMMC and you get around 15GB left de to pre-installed Windows Home. I will gve you few tips how to get more storage as follows:-Once you buy the notebook, the first thing to do is to UPDATE the Windows Home. Download all updates and install until no updates are available.-After successfully updating the notebook, free the space by removing the previous version of the Windows. It will save you around 2.5GB.-Now, uninstall all pre-installed tools you will not use.-Then, install your software you will use.-Clean registries, junk files and cache from browser.If you still need storage, then use an external Hard drive.The battery is OK. If WIFI is ON, and if you are just browsing without watching videos, it can go up to 10 hours. If WIFI is OFF and you are doing just basic office tasks, it can go up to 11 hours. I decreased brightness to save battery. The charging is quite fast, 1 hour already more than 80% charged.Ask questions if you have,,
After updating Windows and uninstalling some junk, I was able to get 15GB free space left before I install anymore apps. I then put in a 128GB USB 3.0 Samsung Flash Drive Fit, which would have been invisible if it wasn't white.Performance was better than I expected. Having 4GB of RAM helps so much compared to other budget laptops with 2GB. Just having it on uses about 2GB of RAM.I was actually surprised that this laptop can play 1080P youtube videos. I recommend turning up the saturation to about 30-40 in the Intel color settings, because its very pale by default.A big plus is that the power and charging LED is not pointing directly at you, but to the right side. However an interesting design choice was that they removed the CAPS LOCK LED and chose to use a screen overlay.I don't like the extra column of keys on the right side along with a power button so close to the BACKSPACE. The fact that the keyboard and trackpad is off-center is even more strange. There is so much space above the keyboard that they could have used. I sometimes hit some keys on the right side and all sorts of witchery happens. I set the power button to turn the screen off instead.*update, after having to evacuate because of a hurricane, the lightweight and slim profile of the laptop was not a problem when only taking one backpack with me. This slim 14" laptop is a great size for on the go and would consider this size and style of laptop again.Tip: Change Chrome Downloads folder to the USB 3.0 drive and never have to worry about hard drive space again.
I've been using this computer for five days now... it's great! I use it for purchases, email and surfing and I couldn't be more pleased. I chose wisely. Best computer at this price range and better than computers I've purchased at triple the price. I'll update if any problems arise in the future.
I had been looking for an affordable laptop with the features this laptop has. There were no reviews at the time, but I was pleased with the specs and ordered it. This is a decent laptop for the money. This is not a very powerful laptop, but for my basic needs it will work well. I have found when using the laptop when it's charging, it gets hot around the upper left area of the keyboard. There are a lot of programs on here that you will probably want to remove as there is about 10 GB of free space remaining when it arrives. The laptop is light being under 4 lbs and nice and thin to take on the go. Overall a decent value and buy for the money.
For the price this is a decent laptop. You can install other operating systems (you need to set a BIOS password to actually change the secure boot settings).This laptop runs Manjaro Linux well. The screen is nice but as others have stated the viewing angles suck, but not a big deal.The laptop is fan-less which is fantastic for this price.Battery life is very good, in Linux I am seeing 7-9 hours with light browsing at 3/4ths screen brightness.Trackpad is decent, though it's flimsy, I wish it was a bit sturdier.Can do 1080P video on youtube, and HW accelerated video playback for h264 and h265 through mpv.What I would like to see:- Expandable storage besides the SD card. Would have liked to put in my own M.2 storage.- Sturdier trackpad, the pad itself is a little too flimsy.What I loved:- Battery Life- 1080p Screen- Performance at this price
I believe this device is meant to compete with Chromebook. That's the market. It has more internal storage than some big-selling Chromebooks. Some will criticize this device on the basis of its internal storage capability. Not me, that part is fine. It's slow though. I think it's fair to criticize this device for its relative slowness.This is a serious device to consider if one is already thinking about a Chromebook. One has to weigh many different points to know which will be best for one's purposes.Here are some points I believe are worthy of consideration:1. Got an extra Microsoft Office license to spare? That's one important issue for many. If so, that makes this device more attractive.2. Is your router close to where you'll operate this device? My Apple computers and Kindles work further from the router than this one. I consider that a potential limitation that I think one should keep in mind.3. It's got Windows 10. I think it's designed to be a universal app ecosystem. The start menu really presents the many programs nicely. Keep in mind that many or most of these programs aren't included except for separate purchases. The default browser is Microsoft Edge.4. It's got 32 GB internal storage. My Chromebook has half that and it's surprising how much one can do without relying on internal storage.5. The ports can't be beat for this market with USB 3.0, HDMI - still has two USB 2 ports.6. My experience is this is very good for typing. The keyboard is big and it certainly beats my Chromebook by a lot. I like the way my hands fit on it and that my wrists rest nicely on it. The keys on the keyboard are ok.7. I see that hourglass too much. All the little wait times add up. I ask myself whether the typing comfort offsets the waiting, and I just don't know.8. The screen is workmanlike. I consider it basic when compared to alternatives, but it's not bad. If one is doing some continuing professional education on this device, for example, the screen is just fine.
I'm a long time technology evangelist - latest and greatest is my thing. I don't buy bad technology and I research everything. If you are looking for a simple laptop to use without all the bells and whistles (and you're not gaming!), you'd be hard pressed to find something better at a cheaper price.Pros:Long battery lifeQuick for its price rangeWake from standby is quickWindows 10 loadedUSB 3.0 ports & BluetoothNice Display resolutionBright but colorful at full brightnessCheap enough to replace in a yearLightweightCons:Acer isn't well known for reliabilityLack of CD-ROM/Blue Ray (if that's even a Con)Not a powerhouse that can run several apps at once compared to higher end PC'sOverall this is a steal of a deal and with Windows 10, it puts it into impulse buy range. Compared to Chromebooks which used to be a lower cost alternative, this should be your go to cheap laptop option.
I have purchased and used literally over a dozen notebooks over the last two decades. The Acer Aspire is an intriguing machine- for the right purposes.This Acer Aspire 1 is a budget priced Microsoft notebook, designed to compete with Chromebooks. The specs are modest with 4 GB of RAM, and a Celeron N3450 processor, although this is a quad core (but not hyperthreaded) part, and has a little more performance than some other Celeron parts, like the ubiquitous N3060.Perhaps the most limiting component is the "hard drive" which is eMMC and 32 GB total capacity. As the machine ships, it has just under 10 GB available storage space, so those looking to store a lot would be better off with another machine.This type of drive is really the cousin of a flash card, and has speeds that are fairly slow.The other ports are fairly good, with 3 USB ports (one even 3.0), and an Ethernet port that has Gigibit speeds. There is also an SD card slot, that is full sized. There is also a full size HDMI port. The wireless supports both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies.The keyboard is fairly good, with no clear shortcomings. Key travel is decent, especially for such a slim machine that is 0.9" thick. The display is a TN panel, with medicore color range, limited viewing angles, and less than stellar color brightness and contrast. However, it is 1080p, which gives it a smooth look, and video watching is acceptable on this device.The design is fanless, and never really gets hot in use. It was able to smoothly play a 4K YouTube video without any stutter. The outside of the machine has a nice textured feel that hides fingerprints. Almost needless to say at this price point is that the whole notebook chassis is made from plastic, and a drab black one at that.For power users that wish to play games, edit video, or other resource intensive tasks, this Acer Aspire 1 is clearly not the machine for them. I also would not recommend it as a user's only PC, as none of the parts are top notch, nothing can be upgraded, and the storage is limiting.However, as a secondary machine, this Acer Aspire 1 is a bargain. It is kind of a netbook reborn, a Chromebook competitor, and tablet replacement all in one package. When we factor in the sub-$200 price point, and the quad core CPU, nothing else really competes with it. In my case, I just needed a machine to interface with a printer and scanner in a basement, but after buying, I like the 14" size, and find myself using this for simple web surfing and emails, and it performs quite well, a sort of "Internet appliance." I could also see this being used for school age children or the elderly that need more than a Chromebook to be able to add a few simple programs, as it easily ran Paint.net and LibreOffice with no issues, while having multiple tabs open in the browser. It would also be handy for travel as the compact size, light weight and long battery life make it ideal, and at a bargain price that makes it less painful if it gets lost.The main competitor to this Acer Aspire 1 is the HP Stream. While the HP Stream 14 comes in more fashionable colors, I prefer the Acer Aspire 1 as it has the quad core CPU with more processing power over the HP Stream's dual core Celeron part, and the Ethernet port on the Aspire 1. Both have 4 GB of RAM, and the 32 GB eMMC, and both are often similarly priced around $200 (although the Aspire 1 is often priced a little less, and has better specs).
Just received this laptop yesterday. The on board SSD is about in the middle of a top end SSD and a regular HDD. I like the 1080p screen and keyboard/track pad. The performance is pretty good, especially at this price point. It is light and thin, which is another plus. I am disappointed that the RAM and HD are not upgradable. Also the SD card sticks out about half way when fully inserted. So if you plan on using an SD card for additional storage it will be in danger of getting knocked out if putting into bags a lot.
The laptop has amazing power for home, work and school use but the amount of ROM (hard disk space) being only 32GB is waaay to low to use anything else than chrome and microsoft office. Usable is like 29 gigs and of those only 9 are available, so don't expect to load music, movies or anything here, have everything in SD cards or USB flash drives.The screen is just plain bad, with the blue light filter it looks waaay to yellow, but a little tinkering on the display properties and a different wallpaper helps a lot, but angles are bad as well. But, it is 1080p which is awesome at 14" and it comes with windows set at 150% sized items so that they are not so small on screen, perfect for my grandma which is who I bought this laptop for.The graphics are intel hd 500 and it does an awesome job at driving the display and even videos at 4K on youtube. But don't expect to do any gaming on this.On the other hand, if you use teamviewer to control your PC at home like your main machine or use this as a web content consumption device like youtube or netflix it is awesome, or even to use Steam in Home streaming.Basically it is like a chromebook, but with proper windows.Pros:The price, just, it is too good for what it can do.The fact that it is 1080p.The port layout, plenty usb readers and a ethernet port on a laptop this thin are very welcome.Serves as a chromebook but with proper windows and the ability to work offline and install normal .exe files.Cons:The screen is bad in colors but fixable, but really bad at an angle.Battery life is average being a low power device should last a little more. (used in performance mode not power saver)It only has 32GB of storage which is really the only bad thing about the laptop in general because you have to be online to work with online files or to use teamviewer or to play games on it with geforce now because it can not hold more than 9 gigs worth of content and thus it should only be used for home use where you have wifi at all times or at work but work and school can fill up those 9 gigs with files and junk pretty fast.If there was a model with 128 gigs of SSD or 500gb of HDD this would be awesome in general and only the screen would be bad about it.
I really like this laptop. It has a great screen and offers good web browsing experience. After installing Office 2016 and applying the latest Windows and Office updates I still have 11 GB free on the C: drive. So it's not as bad as some other reviewers described it. Performance is also satisfactory both when browsing, streaming content or working with Office.Definitely recommend it.
I really wanted to like this computer since it came loaded with a lot of good applications. I've worked with it for two weeks and the touchpad makes me crazy. It started out as not responsive at all and I had to hold everything down for several seconds to make it work. It got faster over time but there is still a huge lag compared to the touchpad on my 10 year old mac. On the left click side, there's a lag. But on the right click side it is too responsive so I was constantly clicking on things I did not want to click on. The curser just seemed to zoom all over the page. It was a cheap computer so maybe comparing it to a Macbook Pro touchpad is not fair - but I still expect a touch pad that doesn't make me want to scream. Not crazy about the "Cortana' voice set up either. It took 10-15 minutes to set up what normally takes about 2-3 minutes on a Mac - part of that was the difficult touchpad. And this may be a windows issue, but I was constantly accidentally activating Cortana even though I turned her off. On the good side - I love how tight the serial ports are. No chance of them getting pulled out accidentally. I love the fact that you can drag and drop or copy like you can on all Macs. That may be the newer version of windows software, but it works very well. Came loaded with a PDF opener and many other things I normally have to download. Might be why the storage space was very limited. One other pet peeve every time I touched it, even with clean hands it left finger prints everywhere. It does boot up fast and the Edge browser works well. Very light computer as well, but feels sturdier than some others at this price range. I guess I will have to look at some of the more expensive Acers but will have to read even more reviews (than I already did) about their touchpads prior to buying. Hopefully, if I spend a little more I will get a touchpad that works much better and more storage. Maybe that's a higher level Acer, but we shall see. PS..the battery life was excellent and more than twice the time I get with my Mac.
Not many people give this computer 5 stars but i do. The reason is primarily for the 1080p display. It makes reading text no matter what size wonderful. Everything works very well on this computer as well. The speakers are a little tinny which is to be expected on a budget laptop but their volume is loud.The first thing i did after the initial setup of a new computer is install a Samsung low profile 128 gb usb flash drive that stays in all the time. A usb flash drive is absolutely necessary on this computer to be able to update to Windows 10 version 1803. Then i went to Settings,System,Storage and told Windows to store everything to the usb flash drive. Then i installed a usb cordless mouse. And i still have one usb port open.It was a struggle to get Windows 10 version 1803 to update as there were about 8 other updates at the same time. The usb flash drive is mandatory in assisting the update process. There still wasn't enough space even after running Disk Cleanup and clicking on Cleanup System Files, putting a check mark in all the boxes and ok it. I did that 3 times at different intervals of the updating. I had to uninstall the 1 month trial version of Office 365 and tried to update again. Still failed. So i uninstalled three games Which could have been moved to the usb flash drive but i chose to just delete them. That was enough and it updated to Windows 10 version 1803! Then i ran Disk Cleanup again cleaning up system files and i had a whopping 13.5 gb of free space on the 32 gb emmc drive.Windows 10 has a few foibles like saying the flash drive has errors and wanting to scan and fix it. It doesn't. And the power button won't put the computer to sleep but closing the lid does. I can live with these things. I think it is a great buy.
Just received this computer yesterday, turned it on and I'm surfing the net with it now. For the people that insultedthe display graphics, I think the graphics are not bad at all for an inexpensive internet machine. I don't plan on doinga whole lot of media or stuff, and this machine is working just fine for what it was purchased for. Count me as onehappy customer!
I'm writing this review to help those on the fence.First - many had trouble updating to the latest Windows 10 version.You have to removed all installed software, including office. Then the update will go through. Then delete the 'old Windows' file. That will clear out a lot of space.After you do this - re-download Office and the other programs you want.On to the computer - this computer is fast. A lot faster than I imagined. It multi-tasks reasonably well. I ran Word, a PDF file and Crome at the same time (with 4 tabs open on the browser) with no noticeable lag. Very nice processor.The big drawbacks other's mention - lack of storage and the weak trackpad are indeed negatives - but you have to remember this is a sub $200 computer. grab it on sale with the free 32 gig flash drive for a super value. I added an old mouse to this to get beyond the track pad weakness and the computer is running like a champ.If you have realistic expectations, this computer is a home run. If you think you can get a true gaming computer for sub $200 - you're dreaming.All in all, I give this 5 stars and recommend for anyone looking for a writing computer primarily that also can do light media and surf the internet. Get this deal.
I had to return the first one I receved becuase it stopped working a couple of days after I recieved it so that was a bummer. Second one has been perfectly flawless running Linux Mint tho. I needed a secondary laptop that would last 8+ hours for basic tasks like web browsing and writing and this fits that bill quite nicely. Already own a $1300 Gaming laptop but it only lasts 4 hours on basic tasks even with Nvidia Optimus on board.I switched over to Linux since 32gb is just NOT enough space for Windows partically if you get Major updates like the Fall Creators Update and the laptop was made before it even came out so you would have to reinstall using a brand new ISO from Microsoft but if you do you are going to lose the Acer software so I just said nope $200 is plenty for a Linux machine since I ain't running games and the like that require Windows. Linux handles everything I throw at it for what I use the laptop for.
Decent overall. 95% of what I do is just writing/word processing using Scrivener and google docs. On Scrivener, the words look slightly fuzzy. Maybe this is the thing with the screen not being amazing, but it's fine enough for me. Words and images look sharp and fine enough to me when web browsing or with other programs.This has twice as much memory as my old HP stream and a bigger screen (14 inch vs. 11 inch), also programs are working better with Windows 10 then the Windows 8. I can now sync my work with Google docs which did not work with Windows 8. I would have preferred to get a Chromebook but needed windows for Scrivener, and I wanted to spend the minimum possible--this fits the bill. I also like that this laptop is thin and lightweight for the plane. Hope it proves sturdy enough.One annoying thing--the power key is exactly where my old delete key used to be, and I use the delete a lot when writing. The delete key is tiny so I have to stop and look for it. A few other minor issues of getting used to a new keyboard. The computer itself runs fine.The only thing is the power cord is cheap. It will barely connect then it doesn't, and it won't stay plugged in. It's the cord that's the problem, not the computer itself. The cord for my former laptop fits in tight and charges fine (thankfully!), but as I'm passing that laptop onto a kid, I still need another cord. Apparently I will have to call the manufacturer and deal with that, which is a pain. Hopefully they will send me a better cord.
cheap and good enough for basic tasks including running MS Office and browsing internet. Great School laptop.
Im giving this 5 stars.-Its reasonably fast...as in it doesnt completely struggle with normal tasks/browsing.-The screen is passable. Its 1080p, but its got to be a TN panel bc the viewing angles are bad unless youre looking right at it and the colors just arent that great (though turning up the saturation in the graphics panel helped push some color in-Its cheap. windows alone costs what? Around 100 bucks. I got this for 220-It boasts a 9hr battery life. Im getting probably more like 4-5. Though I do have the brightness turned upThe main reason Im giving this a 5 star rating is because I just needed a computer to run Examplify to take exams on and this was cheap and doesnt completely suck as a computer as a whole. It exceeded my expectations. It will not replace my Dell Chromebook 13 as my daily driver though because that laptop is better in every way (except it doesnt run windows to run Examplify).Ill probably give this compter to someone once Im out of school for browsing the internet assuming the battery doesnt die
This computer is terrible. It is constantly freezing. Within a month the touchpad stopped working which is odd since I hardly ever used it. I just wanted a computer to check email and browse the internet, but it doesn't stay on long enough for me to even check 1 email. Worst purchase!
This computer is great if you keep in mind its biggest limitation:The internal storage is only 32 GB, and it is non-extendable.It also has somewhat slow processor (which on a plus side allows for great battery life), 4 GB on non-expandable memory, and no touch-screen.The only negative, not related to specifications, I would like to share with you is the finish. It is plastic trying to emulate brushed mental. The plastic ridges scratch easily, and the finish looks bad when scratched.Installing all the Windows updates takes very long time and many reboots. Here is how you can speed it up: use the Microsoft media creation tool, and download the installation of the latest version of windows to a USB flash drive.Boot from the USB flash drive; choose fresh install, and delete all existing partitions from internal storage before installing to unallocated space. This will give you the latest version of Windows and the maximum amount of free storage space for future use (whatever tiny it is).Do not worry about drivers; Windows will find them automatically after a reboot or two.
I was surprised at how nice such a bargain priced laptop could be. The screen is bright and sharp, the keyboard crisp, the case sturdy. The almost instant loading, as opposed to mechanical hard drives-- is fantastic... in fact I am writing this review on the Acer. I did have some issues with the Windows 10 installed on it. I would advise anyone purchasing this laptop to remove and/or inactivate all the Bloat-ware that comes with it-- ie; apps like the game, news, demo programs- they definitely slow it down... they slow'd it down enuff that watching stream'd media was nearly impossible. This is not the Acer's fault, for once I removed all that Win 10 junk, , the machine has been a dream. It would be nice if there was more memory- even with all the Bloat stuff removed, there is only 12GB's left to use. I don't do any heavy programs on this machine, and that's low memoery is fine with me- though I would look to external memories if I needed more- I would buy another in a heartbeat.
Great machine for the price. I had a similar Acer that I was a bit too rough with and it only had 2GB RAM. It was a great machine too. I bought this one to replace it. Acer makes a good budget product, in my opinion. Zero problems. It would be a better buy if you could purchase this machine sans Windows 10 for a lower price.
Technically works. I had modest expectations for this laptop, but it consistently struggled to handle a single chrome tab. Just one. I just wanted to use this for google docs and not have to bother with the weirdness of a chromebook, but this just couldn't handle a single light task with any reasonable speed. Build quality is fine and the laptop looks good, but man, even for a light duty device, this just doesn't cut it.
I use a laptop to keep our network running, which is fairly extensive - 4 routers, 8 access points etc. One of our routers was getting flaky, so I pulled out a spare to configure it. I also pulled out the Acer which has been sitting on charge for a few weeks. I went to power it up and nothing. Black screen. Unfortunately it only lasted 5 months. No response to any buttons even after battery reset (which you have to open the case to do). It is now in the recycling bin and I have purchased a Dell to replace it.
For the price, it's a good deal.Pros:- Keyboard is large, quiet, easy to type on.- Big 1080P screen is nice. But not perfect, see cons.- System is responsive, and doesn't lug down or lag during web browsing, office use.- Minimal bloatware.- SSD seems speedy enough. It's a bit on the small side. After deleting most unneeded apps (including Office), installing others (Chrome, Evernote, VPN), and doing the raft of system updates needed, it has just over 10 GB free. Which is enough for streaming movies and connecting to the office via RDC for the heavy lifting, but skimpy if you want to run Office locally...or pretty much any other big suite like Adobe.- Lots of ports.- Good battery life.Cons:- Trackpad is touchy sometimes, unresponsive others. Turning off multi-finger gestures seems to help.- Trackpad is noisy. It clicks pretty loudly when you press on it.- Vertical viewing angle is pretty narrow. Tilt the screen a little bit and the colors darken or wash out. Not a big deal when surfing the web or doing office stuff, but distracting when watching movies.- Windows 10 Home. Lots of stuff you can't disable or remove. But it gets the job done.- Weight is of course a little more than a typical modern 11" or 13" laptop.- SD card sticks out a ways.Overall, it's a nice system. The trackpad is probably the biggest issue. But a $10 Bluetooth mouse is a good workaround.
The value packed into this laptop far exceeds it's pricing point. If you are not familiar with how to setup windows including updates and how to reassign storage to external media then stop reading as this laptop is not going to meet your expectations and will frustrate you.The form factor and weight are both very comfortable. Its keyboard types well but the track pad leaves a bit to be desired. The screen quality is more than adequate for the price especially taking the 1920x1080 resolution into consideration. Speakers won't wow you but they absolutely get the job done.Web surfing, word processing, and media viewing are all very smooth.Being fanless it is silent and does not get hot. With it's low power usage the battery lasts hours even on a high performance profile.Do I wish it had an IPS screen and room for a SSD? Yes. Would I have paid a little more for each? Yes. Am i disappointed? Absolutely not!All in all it's an exceptional value so long as you remain realistic with your expectations at this price point.
So the RAM is DDR2 and is only 4GB for ever. So the internal drive is 32G, 16 usable after OS is installed. So the SD Card does stick out, it works well, it just sticks out so you must unmount and remove before packing your laptop away. The screen is fine, it is functional, it is fine. The keyboard, while not back-lit, works well. Not too much play. The QC on the laptop was good. The laptop is very light and quiet.This is not a speed demon, this can get laggy if too many resources are being used. It is perfect for web-surfing, it handles MS Office well. I haven't tried any hardcore data processing, but that's not what this laptop is. This is not a gaming machine, you could try, but I'm sure most games would not run well.So far, it's been a great laptop. I purchased knowing that a sub $200 laptop is not optimal, but it meets my needs. I store my documents online, I access most work apps online, and it is insanely light. Again, it runs Office apps, including Access and Outlook fine.I highly recommend for light tasks and not gaming. It would be great for most students, and frankly, most people using the web and running MS Office applications.
The only thing you should worry about this small laptop is disk capacity which is 32GB. It took me about 12 hours to upgrade to the new version of Windows 10. That's why I had to return it. Acer should have made it 64GB.Other than that, the screen is perfect, sharp and clear full HD, battery life is fantastic, I took it to the library and most of the time I was watching videos from youtube and still it lasted like 4 hours and another 4 hours were left.It's very light, keyboard is OK, Wifi is lightning fast and problem free.I just upgraded to a new and more expensive one but still it's Acer.So, if your budget is limited and you think you can live with 32GB disk(you know you can always attach a microSD anyway) this laptop is probably the best laptop on the planet with that price tag.
Good computer that can play games pretty well and is great for school work. I like the 1080p screen and the trackpad is ok. The only things I don't like are the amount of storage that it comes with and the way that the sd card sticks out half way of the laptop. Also you can not upgrade anything in this laptop.
Nine hours of battery life, runs Windows 10, and is capable of running Android Studio and building Android apps. If you're looking to take light productivity (presentations, writing, blogging, programming, etc.) wherever you go, and counting on it to have enough battery to get something done on a whim, there is simply no better choice.Obviously you get what you pay for, and you're not buying a computer that plays the latest & greatest video games, nor will it do you any good for professional video editing, but if you have a workstation and feel like remoting in to get work done, this product is going to be your favorite at this price point.1080p screen â?Plenty of screen estateFanless â?It doesn't run hot enough to need oneBattery life â?Will last longer than it takes Tool to release their next albumThin and light â?Just stick it in a sleeve and throw it in your bag
This laptop is great for the price. Even though it's a Celeron CPU the performance is pretty good because it's a newer generation one. I was also surprised to see that it is quad core. It's at a 6W(Watt) TDP(thermal design power) so the laptop doesn't get too hot.I really like that it's fanless because you can actually put it on your lap without getting third degree burns. I chose this over others because I will never go below 1080p resolution. The screen is a TN panel so it can look washed at the wrong angles but for the price I don't care. I saw some reviews complaining about the touchpad which I don't understand because in my opinion it is really good, especially for this price because I have seen shitty ones on laptops in the 400 dollar range. Obviously we will talk about the elephant in the room which is the 32GB storage which is also non-replaceable along with the RAM. A tip I can give is just either uninstall some junk or fresh install Windows like I did. First thing to do is install all the updates to know how much space you have to work with. Some simple solutions are external drives or flash drives if you need more space. There is one good thing about the storage however, it is an eMMC which is similar to a solid state drive and basically like the storage you use in your phone so it's fast and not a mechanical hard drive. If you are going to buy this laptop you are looking to do basic things with it like watching videos (most of which are 1080p these days which is why i will never go below 1080p). I personally am using it for programming and school work, as well as booting Linux from an external drive. F2 to enter the BIOS by the way.You should not buy this for gaming, video editing, etc. It's thin, light, 1080p, doesn't get hot and makes no noise, all I really need as a temporary solution.
For the money this is the best deal I've found anywhere on a netbook. It has a full HD 1080p screen and is fairly fast at executing everything I want it to do. Is it the fastest or best no. But it is not the worst at any of it by a long shot. If you want a simple lite weight portable web surfer and email machine look here.You'll be hard pressed to equal it much less out do it in that respect. I've gone so far as to add a external dvd and hdrive as I'm so pleasd on how well this machine preforms for me. I would say add at least a 64 g flashdrive to it right off the bat like I did. Even left with only this modest amount of memeory it'll do your daily web and emails easily for the life of the machine. I wanted a new unused machine as I do not ever like remanufacture tablets,phone or anything with a battery. I've never had one that did not have issues somehow with them. So if you looking for something like this netbook I'd recommend it highly too anyone. I've been around compting since the days you had to put hem together in kit form. Plus I had been working on them ever since and this is a good Windows 10 platform all round to me.
I love my other Acer. This one however I hate. Iâve spent more time trying to get it working than I did researching what computer to get my daughter for college as her Xmas present. Iâve reinstalled windows back to factory settings twice, canât use a wireless mouse, and still having issues with freezing and crashing. Sending it back and purchasing something else
Extremely happy with this laptop for the price. Updating review after 2 weeks. Great battery life and thin, lightweight profile. I have however, experienced a few issues with the lack of storage and trying to run windows updates. But once I started deleting the previous version of windows, cleaning up the drive, temp files and uninstalling programs I don't need, it freed up space to install more updates. I also purchased a 64GB SD card for additional storage at $20. This laptop works great for email and shopping, great picture on the display, writing papers and playing Solitaire. Love it!!! I'll update in the future if this Acer runs into problems, but so far so good. Lastly, I love the "night light" feature which turns the screen an amber color to block blue light after sunset so the light from the screen doesn't impact your sleep. I have my hours set from 6:30pm to 6:30am. Very pleased and I recommend this little laptop as long as you note that storage is an issue and you will have to uninstall programs and delete temp files, etc in order to keep running updates and either store everything in the cloud or on an SD card.
Works fine for a basic laptop. Unfortunately none of the reviews I read mentioned the low quality touch pad and buttons. My other Acer laptop has actual buttons (i.e., distinct from the touch pad), whereas this one has integrated buttons that sometimes don't respond at all and other times respond before you're ready to click on something. It also generally feels cheaper than other touch pads I've used. Fair warning...if you intend to download a large amount of content, the internal storage is virtually nonexistent. Plan on investing in an external large capacity hard drive or flash drive for additional storage.
Great specs for the price, but you will need an external USB thumb drive to update Windows 10 to the latest version. There is not enough free space on the internal storage. Windows 10 will give you an error message stating that there is not enough free space when updating to the latest version of Windows 10. Microsoft has published an easy to follow guide that walks you through the update process with an external USB drive. A lot of people are complaining about this with laptops that have 32GB eMMC Flash Storage. You must have an external USB drive larger than 8GB to update to a new version of Windows 10.
I received this package Dec 30th 2017. Loved the look and sleekness of the item. I realize that the mouse sticks at times and the laptop froze at the start up screen today 1st Jan 2018. When I placed it to restart, it went to blue screen. It read that it ran in to a problem and needs to restart. I don't think a laptop this new should be giving problems so quickly.I'll continue to observe this issue because it'll be expensive to ship this back.
I don't know if I just got a bad one or what but the screen was gawd awful. I just couldn't get a good viewing angle on it. If I looked straight ahead at it it was too bright and washed out and hurt the eyes to read. In order to get a halfway decent viewing angle I had to lean the screen back about 10 degrees from a normal viewing angle. Any head movement up down, left or right gives you a washed out screen. I tried messing with the intel color display settings to no avail. This is probably the worst screen I have seen on any computer in my lifetime. Maybe I just got a lemon. I found it unusable.As for the rest of the computer, I didn't find it sluggish at all. It loaded up web pages and word documents just fine. Even ran MS flight simulator 2004 just fine. Of course I wouldn't even attempt to do any video editing on it or heavy spreadsheets. I could even deal with the 32gb. What I can't deal with is an overly bright washed out screen.I found the build quality to be about what you would expect for a $220 laptop. Cheap screen, really cheap plastic touchpad that makes a noise every time you touch it. Plastic keys. Plastic throughout. While the laptop doesn't show any fingerprints it sure shows oily hands. I'm not sure what's worse, fingerprints or oil. Another thing I didn't like is the way it looks when the laptop is closed. Take a good look at the pics. When it's closed, the lid doesn't completely cover the laptop. It has about 3/8ths an inch down the side that is just for the hinges. Looks funky.I can only recommend this laptop for a child where none of my complaints would matter. If the rest of the screens are like mine was, you're not going to like it. I'm going back to my trusty Acer Chromebook 14 with a lovely IPS screen and quality throughout. What I really want is my Acer Chromebook 14 hardware with Windows 10. I'm thinking Acer's Swift series.
This thing looks great and has great battery life, however it can barely even run an internet browser. Right out of the box it will give you constant "Low on Memory" warnings, and if you get on content heavy websites like facebook or tumblr the cpu will max out and crash your browser. Its super annoying, you would think it should atleast be able to handle internet browsing.
The smallish size and light weight means this thing is super portable. I instinctively held it up to my ear to listen for the sound of a mechanical hard drive/fan, but this has neither. Thanks to the SSD and passively cooled processor, it is completely quiet. The monitor is a decent 720p with good color. Handles web browsing well, and plays back video on Hulu and Netflix smoothly at 720p. Keep in mind this is the least expensive 'laptop' you can get with full Windows 10 on it. There are a lot of things the little Celeron chip will NOT do, such as intense 3D gaming. It does not handle 1080p video well, you will start to see slowdowns at this threshold. If you're wanting something that does these things you will need to spend more than $170. If you already have a more powerful machine in the house, or if you are not into gaming, this is an adequate solution. If you are unsure it will meet your needs you may want to check it out in person first.
Get it. Great price. You WILL need a USB drive with it, even to do the updates.Make sure you turn on the "better performance" option in the hardware policies (a quick google search will indicate what to do). I enabled my High Performance power plan to be aggressive on the CPU, but at maximum power savings for everything else. It has a plastic body, so even when putting the wifi card to maximum savings with minimal radio signals, it gets full signal.I remember the days when even high-end computers were plastic. NOW GET OFF MY LAWN YOU DAMN KIDS!
I was looking for an everyday laptop with a ssd. I didn't want to spend much money because I don't store anything on my computers and I am not a gamer. I just use it for internet, email, bills, word documents, etc. I liked the size and look of this one, so I bought it with really no expectations due to the price etc. I was very pleasantly surprised. It's a very sharp looking laptop. Super lightweight and quiet. If you are looking for something like I was it is definitely a great purchase for the money. You can't beat it for that price.
I needed a Windows computer in order to make some configuration changes to IoT devices around the house using a USB cable. It took about 6 hours to get the pre-installed Windows 10 up to the most recent updates/patches/etc. Probably 6 reboots along the way. Then I was only left with about 1GB of disk space, which wasn't enough to do much of anything with additional software loading. Here is what I did to make it more usable: 1) Uninstall the bloatware/adware as much as possible using the control panel UI. 2) Look for Windows 10 powershell commands to remove the rest. 3) Remove the previous version of Windows to free up additional space. This was able to net me a couple more GB, and make things usable again. Otherwise the device is fine. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that would be rarely used, so the price was right. The touchpad mouse is a bit clumsy for clicking with no separate button, so I found it easier to use a corded mouse with it. WiFi was fine. Screen was fine. So in the end, it's just OK, but usable for what I needed.
Man this thing is awesome! requires an external HD for storage, but starts so fast, keyboard is sturdy, screen has to angled just right, but for the money it can't be beat. No lag in streaming videos, plenty of memory and power.
Very nice quick internet browsing sleek lightweight laptop. Already aware of how much storage there is for the device (apparently others didn't read before purchasing). Did a fair amount of research so I know what I'll need to do certain things with this pc. 128gb SD card, external blu ray/dvd/cd burner, & a nice carrying case are some of the things on the way.
First, before you complain about the size of the hard drive, you must understand that this is meant to be an online computer. Meaning that you use online apps instead of downloading and installing apps. That being said, you will need an extra flash drive to install windows updates. Also, obviously not all apps have online versions. I would not recommend this laptop to any coders because you cannot install visual studio on this computer, the program is just too big. Other than that it's a nice cheap version that would be great for students for taking notes, writing papers, or anything that can be done strictly online.
This laptop is excellent and working great. Fast, sleek design, like a plastic MacBook Air. Keyboard, graphics, and overall use is excellent. I used it for a half a day and the battery was on 50%. I started it up, did the updates, then deleted a bunch of apps I don't use. Basically I use this for personal use, writing papers, surfing, paying bills, Twitter and Music Choice work fine. My wireless printer is hooked up with no problem. Truly didn't think this $209- laptop was gonna be good, but I watched reviews and took a chance and it paid off!
Waste if money... All the memory is dedicated to the software... Crashes almost immediately after set up and won't download updates.
Have now used this laptop for two months and can recommend it. Before buying it, you have to understand what you are purchasing...this is not a gaming computer or a laptop with high functionality. What it can do is provide a device that can deliver basic daily needs...email, streaming, surf the web, social media. I use this laptop mainly to watch Youtube, Twitch and even Netflix for movies for the simple fact that it is so light, I have no problem moving from room to room if needed...like when I decide to go cook...just get up and go. You can literally carry it with one hand no problem. Some have said it's slow...I have not encountered any speed issues. Not as fast as my other laptops but there isn't this huge lag problem. For example...youtube videos play straight on, even when you advance forward...it picks up at that point and goes. No problem with live stream videos either. Battery life is sufficient. Can watch several hours of vids.Biggest draw back of course is memory. But again you get what you pay for. You can add a dew things but don't expect this to hold your music library and/or media library and a multitude of extras. If you need a device to store...this is not for you. But if you need a secondary, or even third laptop to watch vids and social media etc...lightweight vs a full specced out laptop...and something that if dropped or stolen...you wouldn't feel too upset about because there is literally nothing on it of value because it's just for media consumption vs a work computer...this is a good laptop that runs a very familiar OS in Windows.UPDATE: May 22, 2018.....Definitely need external memory for Windows updates. Could have bought a 32gb USB but went ahead and bought a 250gb external hard drive just to have the space. The added $35 cost for HD brings total for this laptop to ~ $250. If purchasing...buy extra memory for it right away (or be prepared to use what you have already) and add that amount to your cost analysis when comparing vs other devices.
Definitely worth the price paid for. It works exactly for what it was purchased for. My 12 year old son uses it to play his games and with the addition of the additional GB from the Flash Drive we bought with it, it serves its purpose. He is able to play his games, browse, load music and its portable. He is able to connect it to his bluetooth headphones so that is a plus. The only downside is, it does take a while to download some of the files but for the price I can't complain. Good computer for the Kiddos.
This laptop is so lightweight. It is easily transported when we travel. The screen is bright and clear. The processing speed is very good. I enjoy using it very much. No problem at all.
Ah, not too bad. I got this for my mother, who doesn't need anything advanced. She has complained about the screen just going blank. If it continues, I'll send it back for her.
I bought this laptop after leaving my larger Acer at home while on an extended trip. It served my purpose well to get online, pay bills, and access social media and Skype. Buyers should be cautioned its hard drive is smaller than some flash drives. Updating Windows 10 may become problematic. After removing some of the MS bloatware and still being storage limited I am looking into installing a Linux distro.Update: This is a throw away notebook. The hard drive is so tiny that it will not permit windows 10 updates and all the bloatware that comes with it. Not only that but it does not permit rolling back to recovery. The BIOS (UEFI) does not permit USB boot making it impossible to use this for a Linux installation, but that doesn't matter because there is not enough hard drive space to install it anyway.Best to buy a used PC than to buy this throw away netbook.
It's not bad of a simple web eccentric laptop for the price, you can't expect much performance if you look at the specs. For those having issues with windows update, you need to remove previous windows installations each major release. I was unable to install April's update after freeing up enough space I was able to get the system fully updated. Clearing the leftover update files and previous windows installs I have just under half of the drive left to do with what I please. Only other issue I've had so far was the Intel display driver when I plugged in an hdmi display the driver failed to work, restarting and unplugging the display didn't fix the issue. I had to uninstall the Intel driver software and download the latest from their site, after installing the newer driver everything worked just fine even the external display.
Why won't Acer make a windows version of the Acer Chromebook 14- with Crouton/Lubuntu installed it is akin to a Macbook and the very best value on the market of any laptop, with an incredible matte display. Hopefully the Acer Swift 1 is comparable, LonTV's review of it is encouraging. The Swift 3 here on Amazon does not have a sharp, matte HD display but rather a glossy retina-burning one and is therefore unacceptable.
Internal HD is so small that the computer is virtually unusable.
The Good: It's really, really cheap. I bought this with the intent of using it only for some quick web-surfing and maybe some occasional word-processing. I didn't need a laptop with high-end components, and this seemed to fit the bill. A huge added bonus was the fact that it came with HD Display, especially at this price that seemed to be a great deal.The Bad: While I knew it was bare-bones purchasing it, I wasn't expecting the performance to be so shoddy! At only 4GB of RAM, it doesn't have enough memory for simple web-browsing. My user experience is constantly ruined by alerts from Windows that my RAM is getting used up and programs need to be closed. These alerts can come with only one web-browser that has two tabs opened up. As such the computer is constantly freezing up.Conclusion: While it may seem like an outstanding deal with HD Display at such a low price, the low amount of RAM makes it very difficult to use. You are constantly maxing out your memory usage with minimal programs open, and as such the laptop is constantly bogged down and freezing up. Spend a little more money on a device that comes with at least 8GB RAM.
I bought as a present for my father for Fatherâs Day and his birthday. Its lightweight and alot faster than our old one! So far so good! He only uses it to read news and maybe play a card game here or there but its perfect for him!
We bought this for my daughter's 16th B-day in September. After 3 months of almost daily use. it is still performing as expected. She uses it to stream movies, access social media and complete homework/study through her schools web page. Probably in that order. She really likes it and the price was reasonable. No complaints.
I purchased two of these for my young kids. The price was great and so far my kid's love them. My kid's do a program called Scratch Coding, which is the primary reason we bought these and they work great for that purpose. The laptops were easy to set up.
Just received the laptop, it has restarted twice already, "kernel error" contact support.
Bought the laptop as a gift. Everything about the laptop was good except the battery. The battery life lasts for a couple hours before it has to be recharged again. The battery life is listed for 9 hours, but definitely doesnât last that long. Iâd expect a new laptop to have a battery life that lasts as long or almost as long as itâs listed for.
Bought this for a friend about a month - 6 weeks ago. It suits her needs, but has started to freeze and she has to wait or shut it down to get it going again.
Impressive screen 1080, and computer for 200 bucks. A little low for bloatware windows 10, due to the low ram, but if you put on Shut up windows 10, it gives it enough ram to do everything I wanted it to do. Which was basically use the internet at decent speeds.
So far so good. Had to go to Acer and update the wireless lan driver to get it to work. But other than that its pretty smooth running. Pretty light and thin which is nice. All in all for $170 I'm not complaining. I did buy a slim 32gb flash drive for more storage that's basically 14gb emmc after operating system.
Needed an extra cheap computer for work. It runs Windows 10 and was a great secondary computer. Good brightness and quick startup. For this price range was the best deal I had found.
Great little laptop that fits my needs. I just wanted something inexpensive and lightweight I can take on trips with me 2-3 times a year. Fits the bill!
Excellent device for viewing media content from steaming sources or web searches. Plenty of interfaces. I recommend adding a flash drive right away since the storage is fairly small.
Everything else is good except that when you open too many windows maybe like around 10, then it tells you to close some of them or else you would risk losing some of the windows. I had a lot of windows once but it gave me warning to close them soon which was good. That wasn't a big deal. The speed was more important, and there was no lag. Pretty light too. I recommend it.
4 Stars So far :-DI just received this little laptop yesterday (a day earlier than expected thank you amazon). So I have not really had a chance to put it through it's paces yet. But so far so good. I can confirm that the display screen is a bit weak and I have yet to figure out how to increase the color saturation (as some suggested can be done to improve) but it serves it's purpose for what I need it to do. When my better 1/2 saw me setting it up (which was spoon fed simplicity) she stated the screen looked terrible. When I turned the screen towards her her response was oh that's better but still not great. Although the display is a bit unimpressive it's not a deal killer for me as I can link this to my tv via full size HDMI that has a beautiful display and have wonderful side angle viewing. That feature is one of the main reasons I decided to buy this under $200 unit. It has a lot of ports and since my wife and I went "mellinial" and cut off the land line & cable tv I lost all my sports channels. There are tons of sports streaming sites online and I was forced to watch either at my desktop or on my 8" tablet. I tried to use MHL & Slimport to link my tablet to my 1080p flat screen but my tablet is incompatible for that use. So the feature using just a standard HDMI cable to watch steaming sports on my big screen was a very attractive feature. I will put this feature to the test tonight when my hockey team plays :-D. I can also confirm the track pad does seem a bit flimsy and quirky and besides the display is an indication if the price point of this device. I disabled some of the 2 tap features and use a wireless mouse anyway so it also is not a deal breaker. I honestly think would be hard pressed to find a laptop that has all the features this laptop has and runs windows 10 for under $200 even with the shortcomings this device does have. The limited ssd internal memory is not an issue for me as my desktop has more than I will ever use in a lifetime lol (1 tarabite). Really the big question mark for me is the longevity of the Acer brand. This is the 1st one I have owned and have heard both awesome & terrible things regarding the overall build and how long they hold up. However considering I have seen some high end units go from treasure to trash very quickly ;-) For under $200 I feel this is a good little unit. Did I mention it is under $200 (usd) ;-)Update; hooking up to the tv is a snap! You get 1080p pic and sound via an HDMI cable. I am very pleased as the primary reason for me to purchase is that feature. Having an extra computer is icing on the cake. Very pleased!
This laptop was loading websites slowly from the first time I turned it on. It reminded me of how my old school computers would work when they started to run out of disk space. I haven't even had this two months and have issues. Now the mouse is frozen and won't work. I'm back to using my old computer and am about to write this off as a lost. I looked online about the mouse frozen and there is some complicated looking stuff to download involving windows 10. My problem is the mouse is frozen so how am I supposed to download anything? I will probably look for something else and give this to one of my more computer wiz younger relatives. For me personally it is not working out very well.Edit on 1-16-17Well I ended up getting a wireless mouse and it works. But be aware that windows updates takes up the majority of the disk space on this computer. I have been getting messages about not having enough disk space to for the next windows update. The pop up suggest I get an external hard drive so I can update windows. My younger relative said I should have been fine to just surf the internet but that was before this latest windows update. All I wanted was a nice little computer to surf the internet and read a few e-books. I didn't really put much at all on this no games! I don't even understand why we are told we getting any real disk space. I ordered this on Nov 30th. At least my other Acer computers lasted a few years before this started happening. If you're thinking about getting this as an affordable Acer computer be aware of this. If I have to keep buying stuff like the wireless mouse and now it's asking for an external hard drive, it negates the affordability of this little computer.
Didn't realize it only comes with 32gb of in bedded hard drive space. Ran out of space real fast and had to buy an external 1T SSD. Also added an external DVD drive since it didn't have a built in one. I might have been smarter by purchasing a lap top that had all this with it. It works great now.
Computer runs fast. Not enough RAM GB. The windows will automatically close programs or black out when the computer runs out of memory to keep programs running. The keypad is sensitive, I suggest to use a mouse.
Bought a total of 3 of these, excellent especially for the price. If you want a good quality & cheap laptop, this is the bomb!
Decent computer, good for the price. But not that fast and the screen is not very good (muuuuch worst than a cellphone screen), it does not have good color/contrast.
This is a great PC and does exactly what I need it to do; surf the net and keep up with my check book. Boots up quickly and the battery lasts a long time.
Good for college, can run games quite well, space is the only issue, comes w/ about 20gb available.
This is a 5 star based on value. If your expectations are in check this is an amazing value for sub $200. The 14" 1080 screen is great. I added a 64 gb memory USB and am very happy.
I bought this like a month ago and it works perfectly. I take it to school everyday. Itâs light, itâs surprisingly fast, the battery lasts for a while, itâs also extremely quiet and it does not get hot at all. The laptop can run Minecraft with no problem but it struggles running World of Warcraft, only good for leveling not dungeons or raids. The WiFi and Bluetooth are awesome as well. Beware how much you use the mouse pad because itâs a bit delicate, excessive use may cause it get stuck so avoid clicking or get a mouse.
I bought this back in November and love this computer ,works great and I love it .Its is easy computer to work with.Thanks for a great product .
This is a surprisingly good laptop for the money. It's quite fast. I would say the screen isn't too great but I am willing to trade off speed for clarity.
Perfect for students. the 32gb suck but other than that the computer functions well, it is light and compact.
screen is flickering already :(
Bought this for my boyfriend daughter for Christmas and we love it for her. It arrive in perfect condition. She wanted a laptop for Christmas and when I found this one I immediately got it because it was the size I was looking for and she is only 9 so its perfect. LOVE IT!!!!!
Needs option for more DDR and more SSD/MMC disk. If these were available options, this would be a very fine computer. As it is,there isn't much room to store a large file or photos, etc. Limited RAM makes some tasks difficult. It would get more stars with better expansion capability. Acer shouldn't sell such dead-end models.
Randomly shut off and would take 20 mins to get back on. No memory what so ever so you had to keep deleting stuff
Pissed beyond belief. Bought this computer, used it a handful of times....less the 2 months later it will not turn on. Window closed for returns. Dont buy this ever. Waste of 222.00
Very nice for web browsing. I use primary for udemy and other learning sites. It is fast and responsive. Would definitely recommend.
This was a gift for my wife, She seems to have no issues with it. Living up to expectations.
Not a bad laptop, the storage is a bit small and I feel it's a limiting factor with Windows 10. Half of the storage is taken up with just the OS (after I removed bloatware) and it was still running sluggish. I tried to install Linux on this laptop, but the manufacturers hid some settings to deter people from tampering with the laptop. I feel some things are just, but not the fact they hid boot priorities. Nonetheless, great laptop! The screen is okay, but 1080p is really nice (I checked the display properties, it states 1920x1080). Then again, I'm reviewing a entry-level laptop, so some faults are bound to occur, but I expected a little more freedom with BIOS settings.
Does what I need it for. Can be a little slow but for me it is perfect.
So far, working very well. Very light and thin. Delivered as promised
Reasonable price and very satisfactory product experiences ^^
Grandson loved it
5 stars for a price to performance ratio. If you're looking for something simple to just browse, write, or that sort of thing then this is a good choice. Affordable, and quick enough to not feel slow. Chances are you will need an external drive.
Not enough memory out of the box to install Windows update, now stuck with it wanting to free up disk space and update every time I start up. I haven't loaded anything on this computer and have been through uninstalling every possible app I can to get disc space, still can't update. Other than that works fine for web browsing which is what I bought it for.
I have had this laptop 3 weeks and it already is torn up. It will not turn on.
Excellent computer for automotive tuning. Not a ton of HD storage, but I store all files externally so that's not an issue. Very thin, lightweight and long lasting battery.
If there was a "no stars" rating, I would have used it on this purchase. On the advice from folks that know more than I do about identity theft, I bought it to use as a dedicated machine for our online banking only and nothing else. It has a 32g flash memory, the same thing used in phones and tablets, in place of a serious hard drive. In other words, it uses a multimedia card in place of a drive. Now, the problem with this idea is that 28g of this space is necessary for the operating system. With this setup, there is only 4g left for anything else. It is not only slow, but hasn't enough storage space to update even the operating system. We have very, very minimal software installed; A browser for getting online and the software necessary to pay bills, etc. on line. It is not able to update anything for lack of space to do the work. I can't imagine what this machine could possibly be good for.The only plus in this purchase is that I learned a $200 lesson in emmc theory and operation. Bottom line; Do some research first.
Pros:1. Lightweight, probably good for taking notes, presentations, reading etc.Cons:1. Barely usable with low specs. I bought it for browsing internet, using netflix etc. and was not satisfied with the performance.2. There was a low humming/static sound coming from its corners.3. The screen brightness flickered when watching netflix videos.
awesome for the price
I've been working on computers for half my life and this one flummoxes me. The primary C drive is only 28GB - not enough to install Windows 10 and run things like, oh, say, a swap file, which makes performance AWFUL. You can add an SD card, but the SD slot is very poor build quality. Half the card pokes out of the shell, meaning it WILL get bent out of shape. The driver that runs the Intel TPM always launches and consumes > 50% of the CPU, and during the process it prevents a lot of devices, including the touchpad, from working. Meanwhile because of your busted SD card your D drive is going ON off ON off ON off ON off.It's just badly built. Given the price I was ready to make some concessions, but this thing is barely functional. Not to mention it comes with Windows 10 1703, and doesn't have enough room on the drive to download 1709.Awful, awful computer. Skip it.
This notebook worked awesome. I added external micro usb 3 memory 128GB. Very good for Skype.. Low weight.
This is a fine laptop for simple tasks.such as writing a blog. But it does not have enough RAM for serious programming work.
So far so good! I purchased this laptop for my daughter that is a college student. She has had it for almost a week and loves it! It is light weight and easy to set up.
I purchased for my husband who is not computer savvy. It was easy to set up. My husband says it runs fast. It is light weight and the screen resolution is clear. Key board is also good. He is very happy with the laptop.
it's a beautiful laptop very nice , liked how thin it is , but VERT disappointed in the function of the laptop. very slow to many programs that are not needed . and when it updates takes up to much space. very unhappy.
Perfectly meets my kid's BYOD device needs. A pretty response machine, very limited on board memory but wit the addition of a 128gb micro usb drive it's works well, not quite a seamless fit but enough that leaving it in when packing away should not cause any problems.
Good computer. Works great for what I need it which is web browsing, reading emails and social media.
It seems as if I do not have enough gbits to support window 10.didnt think this would not work with just paying bills. How can I get more gibits
A present for my son. Will update if it sucks
I find this to be very dependable. I love its small and sleek design as well as how light it is. Which makes it easy to take around with me on the go. I do find that it gets hot easily but other then that It's great. Oh! It also doesn't have a CD/DVD slot. In case you didn't know. (I didn't).
This is a nice, inexpensive laptop which is great for traveling! I am impressed by it's performance.
Liked this so much, we bought two of 'em! (One for hubby and one for myself)
Light weight and easy to travel with. Very user friendly. So far, no issues.
Easy to use-but Windows updates will not complete-Windows 10 takes up 75% of the memory.I have I should have looked closer at the specs. Will probably end up replacing it sooner than I would have liked.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas & she loves it! That's all I can say.
I ordered this for a lady and she loves it just right for her needs
Gift for my husband. He loves it.
Brand new laptop and within the 1st 2 days of use the mouse did not work
Husband's request. He says it doesn't have a lot of memory.
Very good laptop starts up very FAST.
I HAVE 3 OF THESE NO ISSUES FOR OVER A YEAR !!!
good computer for the money. Not a lot of memory but did not cost a lot of money either. use it mostly for surfing the web and it works great for my use..
Great computer from my grandkids.
purchased in December and it still works. Huzzah!
spare laptop. Xmas present for hubby. He was pleased with it.
Perfect purchase for my needs which imclude e-mail, Amazon, sports, news and word processing. Canât beat the price and quality for a low end lap top with Windows.
Great laptop so far. Bought for college and works great. The only drawback is the low memory. Use a low-profile flash drive to make up for that fact. Don't use a micro SD card for long term storage because the SD card is not flush to the side of the computer.
This was a Christmas present. it did not disappoint. He love it.
Bought as a Christmas gift for my 8yr old son. Has held up good so far after 4 months.
Works well. Problems are low battery compared to my chromebook and low memory. Needed an external harddrive almost immediately.
Great little computer for the price. It's fast, and nice for consuming media especially.
works really well. got value for the money
Enjoying my device. Very low memory but I only use it for basic stuff.
As advertised.
So far, so great.
Bought as a gift, son loves it.
Good product
Amazing price for and amazing gift
My son loves it and it works perfectly for him
My son loves it, first laptop. Enough space for a single user.
No memory on this pc. I'm no pc whiz but I can't download a dang thing on this. I should have done more research on how and what to buy. The pc works fine but don't plan on putting ANYTHING on the hard drive. NOTHING
So far so good for my son
Excellent for the price
High quality - Great value! This is 2nd Acer laptop we have purchased in last 90 days. Completely satisfied at this time.
Love it so much itâs so sleek and very light weight only thing is not enough space after updates
Nice laptop for the price
the lcd screen is really bad. worst quality picture ive ever seen on a laptop in my life. there is no perfect angle to get a good picture. there is always something washed out, or discolored no matter how you position the screen. other than that, it runs faster than i expected, and the touchpad n keyboard are pretty good. build quality is low, but it is a cheap laptop. you cant skimp this much on the lcd though. come on....
came in perfect conditin with all new love it
I've had this laptop for about two weeks now and I love it!!!! Its lightweight, easy to use and set up. I use it mainly for surfing the internet, watching Netflix and other menial tasks.
I,m very happy with it. it meets my needs, not alot of storage space. i use it mainly to pay bills ,so it works for me. my first laptop it took awhile to get used to it since i have always had a desk top. i bought a wireless mouse with works for me.
It is good computer for the price not really memory is small but I just needed it for assignments at school and stuff so it works for me
Nice computer for under $200!
The acer laptop is all that I expected. Itâs the perfect size. It does what I needed it to do. My son loved it as it was his Christmas gift. He uses it for homework mainly and the screen is very clear. Iâm am berry happy with it
This is a refurbished laptop. Works great and is in excellent condition! Purchased for my daughter and is everything she wanted.
Handled the requirements for which I purchased it. Wish there was an 8GB/64GB version...recommended
Works better and faster than I expected. The only negative is that the touch pad is a little fickle. A wireless mouse solved that. Works perfectly for my needs.
Bought this for my college daughter. She is happy with it. Fast speed and smaller for easier carrying. Just what she needed for school.
cheap option for software updates on devices.
Excellent device. Met my expectations. I needed a device for web browsing and light spreadsheet work, I installed libre excel. Also for office work I connect using Citrix. For all these applications this device is fast and there is no lag.
Description says 2.2 GHz. "This pc" shows 1.1 GHz. Runs slow. Freezes.
Excellent quality, fast delivery and great price!
Not a lot of storage but performance on point.
Had bought the 15 inch Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575-33BM, the wifi only connected to some routers, so I just returned it. Tech support and tech forums were not able to fix it.So I decided to buy this computer. Again, wifi only connects to some routers, then a few days after receiving, the touchpad completely dies and tech support suggests sending it in as none of their suggestions worked. On top of this, the laptop would sometimes freeze up completely even when nothing was open and very little ram/cpu/memory was being used, forcing me to hard-restart it. I ended up having to buy a cheap external wifi (which connects to all routers, this means the wifi card in these laptops is faulty), a usb to update windows 10 since it lacks any reasonable memory, and now since the touchpad died, I'll have to buy a mouse. I'm returning this and NEVER buying Acer again.Garbage laptops, stay away.
It does as advertised.
This is s nice basic laptop. I have had it for 6 months with no issues. I am not a heavy user, it is primarily a back up for my desktop so it is not my primary computer. For my needs it works just fine
I am very pleased with my purchase. Very affordable, came in perfect condition. I DJ different events, this computer does everything I need it to, plus some. Great buy!
Super Fast for the Price!!! Yee Haw!....I live in KY
Good computer for the money. Fast and reliable. Why spend so much more money??
Nice laptop. Cheap and quick.I recommend it for professionals. Windows in it is just for dummy reasons.
Computer runs smoothly and easy for Office use, love the automatic updates and Cortana.
Computer went dead on day 2. I've tried everything, and it will not start back up!
It is very cheap laptop. With great opportunities. You can use this in office.
Excellent for the money
Shut down on me after 2 days! Since I turned it on it kept saying low memory. How... Can a brand new computer that states 32g have low memory.. All I did was download Microsoft office. Now... It keeps stopping the music when I stream it from the web. And it won't load YouTube... Only today it loaded the page. Then I was closing the window that said low memory and it shut down and won't turn back on. It's fully charged. This is just a waste of my time.
Still using the computer. It seems to be very stable.
Wonderful laptop - I wish I had bought one for myself!
One if the BEST purchases ever
This is a neat little laptop. I have been very pleasantly surprised! The storage memory is lacking but easily remedied by an external flash drive.
Still getting to familiarize with it. So far, so good.
For someone who isn't technically savvy, this is not a good buy at all. Win10 and all of its components eats up what very little disk space you have, leaving you hardly any to download what should be your essential downloads. I have one thing installed onto the desktop and I have hourly reminders that I have little space (which I already knew), while also getting Windows Updates every other hour or so. ("Can't install updates". Go figure). Win10 is an ever-growing monster that will eat up your computer. I bought my Acer Aspire four months ago and now it refuses to cut the screen on due to some internal error. A hard reset doesn't even fix it.
Very happy with the laptop. Wish it was Windows "anything" but 10, but I am trying to learn.
Best bang for your buck. No complaints at all
This started out as a really nice product when I purchased it 5 months ago. But now it won't let me update Windows 10 (the notifications pop up several times a day and I have to go through several steps to get it off the screen). Constant messages that I don't have enough memory. All I have installed on this is anti-virus. Seems that each Windows update eats more memory, so that within just a few months, there's none left and no way (that I've found) to add more. And now it has started dropping Wi-Fi signal. This was a waste of my money and I'm very disappointed in it. Don't go 32 GB!Update! - Now 7 months since I purchaced this. I babied this to get as much out of it as I could. I finally purchased another (different brand) laptop and the same day - this one all but died. The background went black and the Microsoft Edge icon disappeared. I tried to restore this laptop to factory default, and there wasn't even enough memory left to do that! Wants me to delete more programs so it can use 8 GB - I don't even have 2 GB worth of pre-installed programs. DO NOT BUY!!!!
This is the second acer computer that I have purchased the first I was so happy with which made me decide to get another one when it quit working after several years. This one I have called the customer service number that was enclosed with the system 3 times now first time was because the system wouldn't come up and twice for a warning that the memory was low. This system is only used for playing games and surfing the web.
So far, so good. Daughter likes the system.
Great laptop for the price
Easy to setup/use.
Get one with WAY more memory. Thats my biggest regret
It works great!! Love it except for the fact that it does seem to fill up the memory very fast!
This computer was purchased for my nephew as a Christmas present, he loves it.
It doesn't have some of the features I got used to (no DVD player), but for the price it's OK.
I love my computer works as expected
This product is ridiculous. It doesn't have enough memory to download the upgrade to Window$ 10 which is it's operating system. Unbelievable! Micro$oft sells an operating system that millions of computers cannot use and brilliant Acer installs it. My two year old computer kept getting annoying messages from Micro$oft (which is another horrible story) that it could not update Window$ 10 because of a lack of memory space on the c: drive. Who knows what is vital and what is expendable? I finally decided (after zillions of annoying messages from the dreaded Micro$oft) to buy a new computer with more memory. The instant I got started on this NEW computer I got a love note from Micro$oft that I didn't have enough memory to update that horrible Window$ 10 on my NEW computer. I had just turned in on and it was already obsolete. I see a Chromebook in my future. NO more Micro$oft for me. I wouldn't even buy their stock let alone another computer with Window$ again.
Good for the price works well for me so far. The lack of memory is the only negative but I knew this before buying
Cheap price, working well. Sometimes it freak me out with system stop problem. Except the problem this laptop is affordable and useful.
Works great so far! Very light and great battery time. If you're looking for cheap fast computer then this is the one!
Not bad
Bought it as a gift for my wife and it is perfect, just what she needed. Great value.
Help my granddaughter with her homework
This laptop is garbage, barely any memory ssd or ram. Chrome basically always overloads the ram and cpu causing the computer to be useless, even with just one tab open. Windows takes 75% of HD so you can't even install anything. Wish I never bought this crap of a laptop.
it is a good one the only thing that makes it a little stressful is the memory but the rest in great.
This product did not meet it needs.. we had no problems with returns
Vry nice like that there are lots of ports and a headphone jack my YouTube paceoshea
Only 28 GB of hard drive space. I can't complete the necessary Microsoft Updates because it requires 8 GB of free space. I only have 2 GB left. This is after I installed SEP antivirus (0.99 GB), Adobe Acrobat DC (556 MB), Google Chrome (566 MB), and OpenOffice (456 MB). Even if I remove all my installs, I won't have enough to complete the operating system's critical update. I didn't need anything fancy, just something very casual....but whoever built this needs to factor in enough space for these critical updates! Ridiculous.
I bought this for my 14 year old son who absolutely loves it.
HAD TO SPEND HOURS AND HOURS WITH TECK SUPORT TO GET THIS THING WORKING
simplicity at its finest
I love how it's so thin and light weight and the battery life last pretty well
Yea i received the Laptop today and i opened the box , itâs so nice .. thanks you so much
I bought this laptop for simple use. A few weeks after using it , it completely froze and nothing i tried worked, They told me to send it back and they sent me a replacement. For about a month it worked fine. and now it is freezing like the other one did. I have very little files on the actual computer. I have everything on a flash drive. Almost all of the storage is full by just running the computer. The only extra things i have on it besides what it comes with is Netflix and Hulu and it can't handle it.
a five star
My husband like it help do the basic thing that need to be done.
For the price, this laptop can be pretty good depending on how you're going to use it. It's on the cheap end of laptop market with $170. For it's price it is an amazing laptop, however it does has it's shortcomings. I'll add some pros and cos for you guys:Pros:- Very slim, lightweight, portable laptop and build pretty well considering it costs about $170.- Battery life is amazing, it lasted me 8 hours on regular day-to-day usage. With movies or YouTube it lasted about 5 hours. I've had much expensive laptops running out of battery within 3-4 hours.- Keyboard and touchpad feel good. I don't have any complaints about the touchpad or keyboard other than no backlight on the keyboard. Of course it's a cheap laptop you can't expect it to have everything.- For multimedia purposes, this laptop is perfect. It can stream 4K videos (provided you use Edge and not Chrome or Firefox). I did however ran into problems with 8K videos. Running video files locally i didn't run into any problems either. It plays all files perfectly.- Display is very nice although not the brightest, it still is very good with 1080p crisp image quality. Viewing angles are not that bad either but it is a TN panel so do expect not being able to view laptop properly from more angular places.- You could "light" game on this laptop. By light i mean really light, like old school 3d games, 2d games and some emulators pre Dreamcast.Cons:- You will run into "ran out of memory" problems A LOT. If you have even 4-5 tabs open in any browser, laptop will slow down and you'd have to close some tabs.- No expansion slots meaning you'd have to rely on the USB ports to have more storage, which you're going to need considering this laptop only has 32 gb HD.- Cannot upgrade windows 10 to the latest version due to not having enough space. Without having to install anything at all, you get about 8 gb space. I still haven't figured out how to use the external storage for windows update and ended up disabling updates all together.- SD Card slot is a shallow one, meaning if you insert a standard SD card it'll stick out half way. You can get smaller half-size memory card adaptors (you can insert micro sd cards in those) but that'll cost you more money. Not having a SD card that fits inside can be problematic as it can hinder the ability to carry laptop in bag without fear of breaking or ejecting the card in the process.Conclusion:To me this laptop has equal amount of pros and cons hence, i decided to give it 3 stars. It's a very good deal for money but if you get annoyed by the cons mentioned, it's better you add some more money for a better laptop. It all depends on what you want the laptop for, what it's main purpose is.
Works well. Slim fit and easy to carry.
problems with the windows. Driver power state failure
This PC SUCKS I should have known windows can't run on a lightweight machine. After updates and deleting bloatware has 11gb free. Couldn't run Facebook, 2x YouTube, amazon, and two other websites at the same time. And normal sized SD cards stick out the side of the PC over 1/2inch.
Very low memory but great for a budget.
great. its bigger than it looks and is very high quality
Very useful laptop for the price.
Received the laptop and has been barely used. We have tried updating the machine and there is now a problem with a driver. Because of the price point of other laptops, I took a chance on this one and I don't think it will work out favorably.
Great product. Worked just like I would have liked it to.
Awesome price and has meet all expectations ! Our son loves it !
great buy. works well
Good stuff
The best
Needs more storage.
Excellent product, good comunication!!!!
I really wish that I could give this computer a better rating but I cannot the only good thing about this is that the screen lays flat that is if this screen actually worked It froze up on me and turned black and would not let me reboot or turn off
Well I got this laptop to download photos onto from Sd card cause I run a photograpy business on the side , It was hard hard to figure it out the 1st time ,plus It go's black for a few minutes at a time then comes back on , I got it cause it has a battery life of over 10 hours I do session all day long at the park for more the 8 hours the battery life will come in handy but if it continues to go black on me & also tells me it is running out of memory all ready WHAT a joke ,a waste of $ it is not even a month old yet ,I only use it to pay bills & play on FB !! and to download photos onto VERY disapointed I have had acers before & never had this issue & this is a brand new one not refurbished :( i wasted my $ again !!
Working excellent so far....great buy
This is the worst laptop I've ever bought. For some reason Windows is taking up 28 GB of storage which renders this thing all but useless. I get messages that Windows needs to update but that I dont have sufficient memory for the update. I run disk cleanup, empty the recycle bin etc. and I still don't have enough disk space. I haven't loaded anything big. The largest load I did was for Windows Office. If I open 1 instance of Chrome I will get a message that I've run out of diskspace and the system will have to close Chrome. Chrome suddenly dissapears at that point. I would avoid this Acer model at all cost!
Great product.!!!
Great product!
My fiance loved the gift I gave her!!
great for what i needed
It is ok!
Great Buy!!
If you want a computer that is only going to work for a couple of months, and you have money to waste, go ahead and get this one. However, be warned, it is not made with enough memory to actually complete the necessary updates so even though I just bought this computer three months ago, I'm fully expecting to have to replace it soon. Unfortunately. I am not incredibly tech savvy and liked how easy it is to use, but I don't make enough money to throw away on electronics. I'm already searching for one that will last longer than a few months, and hopefully will be well worth my hard earned money.
after 6 moths of using this product, I turned it on one day and found the left side of the screen to be unuseable. It had a black shadow with vertical lines. I contacted Acer, the customer service person , informed me the I had dropped the unit and cracked the screen. I informed him that I was 70 years old and the farthest it went was when I placed it on its hinged side next to my chair. I was told to send it back, and they would examine it. I was also told a box would be coming from the to return it in. After waiting a week for the box, I purchased one, followed the instructions, ( wraping the lap top in a bunch of bubble wrap. The cost was $17.02 for shipping it UPS. After a few days I received a call, informing me the item was cracked, and they would be happy to repair it for $120.00. I explained my situation to the rep. and was told thatsd what happened and they would no cover it. I an NOT satisfied with the product, or their answer , and would NEVER purchase anouther product again. Now I have a fairly new laptop the has to be hooked to my TV to view anything.
The Acer Aspire 1 has been an excellent value considering it's affordable cost. A fine companion to my Dell desk-top.
Not enough memory or operating power to have two tabs open.i even bought extra memory EVERY time I use it it says it needs to clears some space....a waste of money...all I need was to browse the i ternet and it can't get it down while shopping in amazon
It works, it's a PC, the battery life seems to be great, but it's incredibly slow for most things. Maybe I'm a bad judge because I've been on Macbook Pro's for years now, but even web browsing just feels slow. It has a great exterior finish visually, but it IS a still plastic, so it doesn't FEEL great. The display opens flat, I'm not sure when you'd ever want your laptop to be flat, but I guess it can do it... it unfortunately doesn't open ALL the way 360 degrees though
It's light and cheap but the machine is not strong enough to handle windows blotware. After opening 3 tabs starts complaining about low memory. If it was chrome os, might have been different story. I was tempted to install ubuntu on it, but because of the emmc storage it was going to be a headache. Decided to return because of the low memory errors.
This is basically I only put chrome and two small programs on the computer together weren't even 1 GB and that's it. When trying to factory reset it it said it didn't even have enough memory free to. Not even 1 GB of programs added and its already out of space. Also no disc drive.
Did not work out of the box, the wifi would not connect to my home network that I have other devices connected to including a 10 year old Aceer Laptop which I love.Also note the Amazon/ Acer Customer Service experience was absolutely horrible, spoke to 5 different agents, reqeusted to speak to someone in the U.S. and would not transfer to level 2 support.My reccomendation is to NOT purchas any Acer items if you think you will require customer support.I think this is why Best Buy and other brick and mortor retailers have stopped carrying these products.
I've been having a lot of problems with this product. I can't seem to get onto it right. But right now I will try for a few more days
Well liked it for the first 3 days then it started freezing and the curser navigator arrow would frees and not work, then it would pop up with a message that said, your PC is missing some information/ drivers we need to restart to fix this errir, or wtfe and it wouldn't fix or anything! So I sent it back and am currently waiting for my new (new) laptop! Very flusterated!!
I like the size and wifi speed and screen image. I knew the memory would be small and it is, but I have portable drives attached for saving files. My need was for something relatively light and fast for emails and sharing documents. It would not be sufficient however if I used it more intensively. I keep many files on dropbox and had to modify the list so that it would save to the device. For the price, it is perfect for me.
Installed iTunes and music after removing bloatware. Not enough memory w 32 gb hard drive. Waste of time and money
Previous Acer computers have been great. This one not so much. I see Acer heading the same way as Dell. I understand that this is an economic purchase, but its not recommended to lower the quality of your product just to meet price points. Two examples: Apple vs Dell. Which is worth almost a trillion?
Amazing laptop especially for its' price! Light, compact, has a Full HD screen (and the viewing angles are also great, despite being TN), and does all the everyday simple tasks, such as doing Office tasks, browsing a web, watching videos, or even play some very light games, such as Sonic Mania or Stardew Valley. Only issue comes from the limited storage of 32 gigs (it fills up very very quickly) and only 4 gigs of ram (multitasking, or even having 2-3 programs at once is barely possible, Windows 10 really requires at least 8 gigs). Still, I would say it's the best in its' price range.
Bought this for my dad for his birthday! Hes very old school. Kept trying to poke the screen thinking it was a touch screen, but its not. Haha. He uses it a lot and its way better than the little one he had. Also a lot faster! If you are a more advanced computer/laptop person, this one may not be best. My dad just turned 51 and this is just right for him! Nothing too fancy.
It arrived with a defect which I returned to Acer since Amazon won't take returns unless DOA. Sent back in original packaging and after repaired it arrived god awful package and none of the manuals and paperwork that came with it. It took three customer reps to even listen to my problem. I hope nothing goes wrong with it because they didn't return warranty info or anything else that came with it.
Turn it onWindows try to updateNot enough spaceInsert a 32GB to temporarily store update filesUpdate failsTried to go into BIOS to install LinuxBIOS locked me outReturned
Not worth a dime. All I wanted was to be able to use Microsoft word/excel and do simple online tasks. It is so slow and constantly interrupting me to install security updates that it promptly tells me it does not have the storage capacity to do. There is no way to use this productively.
Brand new computer, not enough memory to even load the updates. Just got the IT guy to have a look at it to check the problem. What am I supposed to do with it now? $200 down the drain.
This thing shut off on me after only a few days of use. Iâm sending it back. I recommend not trying to cut corners with future purchases, spend the extra $200 or $300 dollars to own a decent laptop.
This p[roduct is a scam Windows breaks shortly after buying it because Windows 10 needs more than 32 GBs to run after a couple of updates. Now I have a broken computer that doesnt work and Acer wont make it right, Windows wont make it right and Amazon wont make it right. This product will scam you out of $220 dollars DON'T BUT IT! Im never buying another Acer product again period and I am done shopping on Amazon. This product will completely destroy your trust with Acer and Amazon DO NOT BUY IT IT IS A SCAM!
I was probably one of tge first to order it.I just wanted a reasonable price for a basic portable laptop with a good screen, the product description said IPS, so I ordered it.The moment I turned it on, I turned it off and started the return process, because this screen quality is certainly not IPS.
Has NO memory. I have 0 pics and videos on this machine, and hardly any documents. Yet, it doesn't even have enough memory for a windows 10 update. Also, the battery lasts about 30 minutes. The mouse is a little wild, even with adjusting. I do like that its light weight and I like typing on the keyboard. It starts up quick too. I like that best. However, I would not buy this again due to the memory and battery deficiencies.
Not the fastest processor and often gets bogged down running multiple programs, but to be expected for the price. A good investment for someone who just needs a simple machine for minor tasks.
This product has several downfalls. One of those is that there is no disk drive installed. Another downfall is that there is no way to increase the storage space. And for what, over $200? Pretty cheap if you ask me. I would not recommend this to anyone.
Bought computer 6 months ago and now when it starts up it just keeps restarting and will not even allow you to reset! Computer is now of NO use and says that only returnable after 1 month! Ridiculous. In 6 months I have not used enough for it to wear out. 45 minutes a day tops
32g is no where near big enough for win 10. I couldnât even do a reset without adding a sd card. Machine felt decent and seemed to work ok if it wasnât for the size of hard drive. Look for something with at least 64g
I haven't used it very much but it's been great. The size and weight are perfect for what I need it for.
Purchased March 6 and it bit the dust on March 24. No power. No charge. Called Acer and went through the troubleshooting only to be told I would have to ship it to them and I would be without my college laptop and only laptop for up-to 6 weeks. Returned. I'm going to find something else that does have this known issue.
I received a paper weight. There was no OS loaded and the laptop has the wear and tear of a well used laptop. I shipped it back as soon as I received it.
Constantly getting limited space errors; hard disk is not large enough to support routine Windows updates. This machine has turned into the bane of my existence and I really regret having purchased it.
Needs more than 4GB of Ram and definitely needs more than 32GB for storage. Windows 10 takes up a minimum of 20GB+ just to finish getting this setup.
Keyboard stopped working after a couple of weeks. I searched online and apparently this is a common problem with Acer laptops. Iâm still going through troubleshooting it before I return it, but itâs been more trouble than itâs worth. I knew a cheap laptop was a risk. Buy something a little more expensive and you wonât waste your time.
Runs fast but gets low on memory quick with certain programs.
Frustrating, not enough memory to be functional.
Not sure. Have not been able to load anything.
I'm really disappointed with this Product Is a brand new computer but I'm having problems with it, sending me fake messages from Microsoft that is having viruses, last time some body almost still my financial information. How can I get support because I don't trust to call at the phone number they ask me to call.
Terrible product. Stopped working after a month and a half. The laptop was dead, would not turn on. Was under warranty, so sent it to Acer, but they said itâs not fixable. I will have to buy a new one and pay the regular price. Terrible product and terrible customer service.
fast browsing and great for online work but not even enough memory for necessary updates...buy an external hard drive or choose something else
As of now.... I would not recommend! Purchased as a Christmas gift and only used it 35 min and it shut down, we charged it and reset but never turned back on! Waiting on replacement from amazon...hope its not defective as well!
I bought this computer to use for personal use and it is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. It is not user friendly and extremely hard to navigate. Also it does not have enough space on it to simply update windows. If you are thinking of purchasing a new computer I highly recommend you look elsewhere.
Not good very slow
Good PC. worth it
I bought this in Feb 2018 and it has never worked properly. Windows has never updated. I've deleting all that has been recommended and still I cannot get windows to update. It is an inexpensive laptop, but not even that is worth not being able to use it.
Not bad lab top for price just wish it had a little more storage
I had to return it. It was very slow AND there were grey lines that would flash in front of the screen very often.
Memory on it is pretty crappy, but I got this for school just for internet access and to be able to write papers. As long as I don't save anything on it, the laptop does what I want it to do.
Worst purchase Iâve made on Amazon. The hard drive is not big enough to make Windows updates. I had to plug in a flash drive with more space than my hard drive to complete updates. Now the screen shuts off every time I PLUG IN the cord. Terrible laptop.
Can't handle much of anything. The system reboots when its processed too much. That happens once in a while.
Barely use it and there is no more memory space
Horrible on space. You will get a low storage message within a week of using this laptop. Its good for access to Microsoft office and the internet , but it serves no other purpose. Save your money if your looking for a serious business laptop. This is not it.
I was looking forward to this computer based on the reviews but when I got it it was a total disappointment. First the computer crashed the first time I turn it on then later on the screen just went dark and stay dark I will not recommend this product
This is an absolutely bare bones computer, with a puny price tag to match. RAM (just 4 GB) and storage (32 GB) is extremely limited, and non-ugradeable, though there is an SD slot you can use for external storage. (Be aware cards stick out of the slot when in use, so leaving them in while traveling is ill advised.) The processor speed and graphics are also minimal. This isn't for gaming, photo or video editing, or heck, really even video watching, since the storage is so limited, though it streams OK, at least via YouTube.What this is good for is price conscious folks who need a second (or third, etc) laptop on hand for browsing or the occasional video stream. My kids are too young, in our estimation, to have their own computers (3 under 10), but there are also things that they do in school (on Chromebooks) that they'd like to replicate at home, like in-browser learning games, a few streaming sites, etc. For those simple tasks and, say, occasional email or Skyping, this is perfect.If we've got one kid on the iPad and a parent on the home's primary computer, which happens fairly often, this offers a low-cost third option to quickly order something on Amazon, play a Prodigy math game or do school-required typing tests. It's also low cost enough that it allows me to let my kids work semi-unsupervised (like, not with me standing over their should the whole time), without worrying about dropping, breaking off keys, etc. And, yes, all those things have already occurred with our pricier laptops in the past, which is how we learned that lesson, but with this one I don't cringe at the potential replacement/repair cost. It's not quite disposable but, in comparison to our Macbook Pro or iPad, it almost feels that way.Yes, you get what you pay for, but if what you want is a low-cost, no-frills browsing/email laptop that runs Windows, this is a good deal, with a decent screen and keyboard for the price. (And, yes, as an all Apple household, I think exposing the kids to other OS is also beneficial and this is a way to do so on the cheap.)
As it comes, does not even have enough memory to open the internet 9r Microsoft Word. Ended up buying a different computer.
Sleek and easy to carry around, but it's not user-friendly and very limited storage even for just browsing and researching.
SD card stuck out too far to be safe, pretty much the only reason I didn't I keep it
Incredible battery life. I use it way more than my laptop PC.
It never held a charge. Very disappointed in this product. Carefully read what it says it does. I'm used to blue screens but this one gave me white one. Um?!?
its a beautiful laptop but the ram is crap. 28 gb is a absurd amount of space for a laptop. i found myself having to buy an 1 tb external hard drive and sd card. other than that its fine.
This laptop worked great for 3 days then it lost connection with the hard drive. Amazon support sent a replacement right away. I hope the replacement doesn't fail.
It's a pretty good Laptop for the price you can't beat it ...
Great Computer for a great price. I love it!
Terrible product. Crashed in less than a month. Impossible to unistall windows due to minimum disk space left. Warrnaty not wordwide.
The good thing about this machine is that it looks like most full-size laptops, though has the advantage that is pretty light. The bad thing here is that it is really limited, with pretty minimal (32 GB) storage and not a whole lot of processing power. Having said that, it is a good computer if you basically want a machine for web browsing - You can add in Microsoft Office (for $100+), though I don't know how well it would run.The screen is pretty good sized and I would say the colors are fair, with pretty good definition. The sound is OK, but nothing to rave about. There is an external speaker jack and 3 USB ports. I suppose you could hook in a small set of speakers or use headphones with the computer. I did play a "mov" with the computer and after taking about 10 seconds to start, played well. Screen is pretty bright and computer seems to go about 8 hours on a single charge.Having said all of this, remember this is a computer for $200. I see it as a good spare computer to use for web browsing and to give to kids to use. It is OK for what it is, but I would wonder if you could spend one or two hundred dollars more and get a computer with significantly more capability. Having said that the one gives you basic functionality at a very reasonable price.
not worth the aggravation of not being able to update. security is also terrible .Love Acer, but spend the money on a real model with real software!
It wasnât what I expect, I paid like 200 dollars, for something that doesnât have enough space and doesnât have window10. Like honestly not what I expected...
If your budget is around $200 please save up some more money and purchase something better. Not worth it.
Do Not Buy This, it will break when it tries to update due to no Memory.DO NOT BUY THIS Amazon should not sell this laptop
there is barely any free space on disk to install apps or update windows.
Performance, Portable and User friendly.Highly recommend Acer products.Continued success to all involved.
this computer turns it self offthen you have to wait a while to turn it back oni do not recommend this computer
The mother board has gone bad and I had this for less than 3 months.I think that I should be refunded.
This computer is cheap but incredibly slow.
a very light weight laptop. is not capable of having more that 1 window open. Storage is low and its very slow
Used for 1 week and the laptop has been powering off randomly multiple times a day.
Great! Only problem is it doesn't have an hdmi outlet
I have had nothing but problems with this computer since I bought itð£! NOT HAPPY
Love the laptop but didn't get my info on warranty I bought
This is a lemon.....very little memory............no room for updates (windows 10)It won't boot up after only 2 1/2 months!
died within 2 weeksdd-returned it
You get what you pay for
Great Laptop for the price!!
Works great for the price!
Good so far
This is a good, basic laptop for everyday use. It's our second laptop with very similar specs, the other being a dell that we purchased a couple weeks ago. We homeschool and all I need these laptops to do is provide a computer for my older kids to do research, type schoolwork, and to run a couple of online math programs. The kids have added amazon instant video, iTunes, and a few other fun things for their down time. This laptop does all of that very well.It was easy for me to set up. My regular laptop is a mac and I wasn't looking forward to setting up a pc but it was surprisingly intuitive. It walked me through the setup and I had it up and running in under 20 minutes. I was able to plug in our USB external disk drive which allowed it to be used to play movies with no problem. All in all this is a good value laptop for those looking for something basic for Internet use and just a few programs.
It sucks, the computer only has 32gbs for me that means that it will not update because it does not have the memory to do so. Why make a computer like that?
the laptop will not accept the full windows 10 updates because there is not enough hard drive spaceafter it was repaired from that problem.......a few weeks later it would not startsent it back to be repaired......then the update problem happened againthis is a pile of garbage
After the first night, the machine "updated" and filled all 32 GB. USELESS WASTE OF MONEY. I wish I had known it was a 30 day return policy..... cause now, i;m stuck with this piece of JUNK..........
Terrible storage... I should have shopped around more.
Nice inexpensive laptop. However, the SSD storage is not upgradable. You're stuck with 32GB. Which is enough to load all of the operating system and the junk that comes with it, but not much else. The work-around might be to use cloud storage for everything. I haven't tried to do that yet.
so far so good
Product isn't all that great. Software freezes most times
Too slow. Not enough memory. No CD player.
Did not place order
the laptop has been damaged to the third week of use. I do not recommend to buy it
I bought this item but windows is not included
What a piece of junk! Couldn't even get the laptop to boot up. Just kept continuously crashing. Total waste of money!
HorriAble Product
WORST LAPTOP I EVER HAD! does not always turn on when I press power button. Email would shut down as soon as I opened it!
Would give it zero stars if that was a choice. Bought it about 5 weeks ago and already died on me.
Sllllooooooowwwwww! Donât buy for internet use. Too much waiting.
the CD player stopped working in 3 months
Not enough space, I wouldn't recommend
Came with maleware pre installed been a real piece of garbage since the day I bought it downloaded updates took up all the storage. Have to restart immediately after turning it on because everything freezes up. Not even powerful enough to run Netflix or Hulu. Highly discourage you from purchasing this laptop. It's just covered in crap you don't need and will never use.
Before you decide on this computer, you should figure out your needs. If youâre looking for a powerful computer for gaming or to run a large business, youâre looking in the wrong place. However, if you want a simple, yet reliable computer for basic office duties, internet browsing, and media (e.g. YouTube) at a great price, then look no further.On the plus side, it boots up quickly (due to the SSD). In addition, the WiFi card handles my high speed internet very well. Iâve seen no issues while browsing the internet. In addition, the battery life is great.Depending on your needs, however, the negatives could be dealbreakers. First, the hard drive storage is downright miniscule at 32GB. And, at 4GB of RAM, there can be a lot of slowdown if youâre multi-tasking. The speakers arenât the best either.So, what is there thatâs redeeming about this computer? If your goal is gaming, even streaming, then just forget about it. The resolution and sound simply arenât worth it.But, if youâre a student or run a small business on a budget, itâs a good, inexpensive choice if you can get around the limitations. For example, if you choose Google Docs and use the cloud (or an SD card) for your storage this should be fine as a basic laptop in most instances.I gave it to my 9 year old as a starter laptop. She uses it for limited gaming, YouTube, and school projects via Google Docs. And, she can check her school email and class page. This gives you a good idea of this computerâs strengths and limitations.Overall, look at your needs, then choose accordingly. If you need a laptop for basic tasks and price is a major consideration, this could be a good one for you.
Just turned it on and already have only 10 GB left of the 32 GB advertised, this is called false advertising.

Don't buy it
"Does it do downloads?" my 12 year old niece asked. I guess, I said!-I've never owned one of these before. A pseudo-laptop. No upgrades available. Fixed storage space ie "hard drive". Fixed RAM. Hm.-But - for the sacrifice in not being able to upgrade it, and no optical drives and few ports - you DO get an ultra portable light pseudo-laptop.It is super light. And thin. I use an Acer laptop normally; it has a dvd drive, bunch of ports - it's heavy. So much so I dread taking it on the plane.But this thing - it's super light and thin.-So - who's it meant for? Small hard drive. But it functions like a laptop.-Kids. This laptop is for kids. Hence, my niece. Downloading a few apps, watching youtube incessantly - this is what the new generation uses laptops for. They don't need office or power or big displays. Heck, this screen is giant compared to the tiny phones they squint at all day long. So - keeping that in mind - this works well for that.-Do you have kids you need to keep quiet at home? In the car? On the plane? This'll work (provided you have an internet connection, which is mandatory for this laptop - otherwise it's pretty worthless.).-It's only two hundred bucks. So, you get this for such a low price; nice HD screen, super light and thin, full keyboard, few ports. That's it! You need to run office? I'd recommend something powerful - like a real laptop...
First of all, for the money, Acer computers just can't be beat. They have a reasonable amount of storage and they are capable of basic computing. But it you are expecting $5000 laptop performance, you will be disappointed. I have this laptop to take to my summer home so that I don't need to carry my laptop back and forth every time. It is great for emails, internet and basic computing. I think the speed and some of the capabilities would frustrate someone who uses it for work or something that requires a lot of capacity. For what it is, though, it is a bargain
I feel like this laptop is really limited by the amount of on-board memory. 32 gigs and a lot of that is taken up with the OS. I immediately hit an issue when I tried to install google drive, and my local sync version of my cloud drive is much bigger than the drive in this laptop. So I thought I'd buy a 256gig SD card and turn that into a data drive. The way the slot is configured, half of the card sticks out. (It's the same way on my ASUS laptop, too, so I don't know if I can blame Acer for this, but it's a clumsy design decision for a fraction of an inch.)The laptop is about half the weight of my Asus laptop, so, really, the only thing I can think that this laptop is useful for is to surf the web in a coffee shop or something. Maybe also to take notes in a class. The keyboard has an undesirable flex to it, so I'm not sure how much you could use it for serious typing though.It really doesn't seem to be capable of running any other application.
One of the few laptops where the hard drive is soldered to the board, apparently. So you can't upgrade this hard drive. Can't return it. Total loss.
It makes me sad to say I'm not happy with my purchase at all. Could be my fault but I really thought the keys had the backlight. Having vision issues it was one of the items that I really wanted and pretty much need. Any possibility of returning it?
This computer is a piece of junk. I tried to install Carbonite on it and registration failed. After a 40 minute remote session with a Tier 3 Carbonite tech, I was told that the base image on the computer was damaged. Called Acer and they tried to convince me that the problem was with the app. I asked to talk to a supervisor. He insisted that I run a factory reset and try to download the app again. Done and done. Still can't load Carbonite. Acer does not stand behind it's product and Amazon clearly doesn't want to hear from me. I will never buy an Acer again.
If you have read some other reviews, you may have noticed the gripe about there being 10 gigs left after what it came with. Truth! Plus, it wants to update right away. So if you are buying this for just light use or for the kiddos, do yourself a favor and buy a good sized SD card to add some space because if you want to download anything that is going to use space, you will run out quickly. You're almost better off opting for a computer with more hard drive space if you don't want to mess with that. You can get rid of a few apps, but you aren't going to recover much space. I do feel that that it should be clear that you are only going to have 10 Gigs, in reality since so much of it is taken up by other processes.The update was slow. The computer is slow, so the update took a long time. Like hours. Windows 10? It ran slow too. Basically most functions ran slow. This is the turtle in a race against the rabbits you can buy out there. If you are accustomed to a fast running computer, this is not the model for you. If you just want to do some basic things on it (no gaming for sure), then it's probably OK for your needs.The computer did well with web browsing and played Netflix just fine. The charger is small and light as well and that's also a plus for traveling.But, it was super light --- which made it great for flying with. The battery life was pretty good for flying also.
This is not the laptop you buy for doing lots of spreadsheets, playing games or any memory taxing work. However, this is really good for surfing the internet, email & simple tasks that donât take a lot of horsepower.-The screen is OK â?not great quality but Iâve seen worse.-The speakers are just OK â?not bad, but fine for YouTube or if youâre not picky about sound.-Keyboard is comfortable & doesnât feel like youâre typing on a miniature keyboard.-Not zippy fast but for simple tasks, it is fine.-No touchscreen.This would be perfect for my elderly mother-in-law. She only does email online, some surfing & this would be plenty for her use. Last year we bought her a laptop with lots of capability that she rarely uses â?this would have been less expensive. Iâm using this Acer in my kitchen for checking email, online recipes & internet surfing â?works great for that & Iâm not concerned about spilling a cup of coffee on an expensive laptop.
Most of the people I know don't need big fancy computers to do what we do on them, which is mostly email, web browsing, simple word processing, and streaming movies. The least expensive computer will meet your needs, and this is a good example of what works. Of course, it's not for video-gaming, or editing feature films, or storing thousands of pictures and movies, but it's an excellent value for what it does.Positive features:--It's noticeably lighter than my Inspiron 15.--It has a solid-state drive, which reboots fast (less than 45 seconds).--It runs quite cool: doesn't heat up your lap!--Long battery life. After 3 hours (mostly video) at highest screen brightness, it still had 50% charge left. Careful management would probably give ten hours of life.--No bloatware, as far as I could tell (because there isn't room for it in storage: see below.)Negatives:--Very limited disk drive file storage. It has 32 GB, but after the system, browser caches, etc., there's only about 10 GB left as accessible for the user. Of course, if you're just browsing, you don't need any file storage at all. And if you do, you can always plug a tiny drive into the USB slot.--No optical drive or Ethernet jack--Trackpad is somewhat awkward, especially for right clicks. The lower right corner isn't sensitive and the only reliable way to get a right click is with the two-finger tap, which I had almost forgotten. This may just be a quality control issue on this unit.--During setup, I was confronted with the dreaded yellow triangle (connected, but no internet access). So I called their 800 support number (the only piece of documentation in the box is a slip with this number on it). I wondered what the hold time would be. But I was immediately connected, told that a representative would be with me shortly and.... immediately hung up on. Three calls, three dial tones. A novice would be dead in the water at this point, but fortunately I had another computer that pointed me to the Windows 10 troubleshooter, which actually fixed the problem.In short, if you're looking for a machine that will meet your web browsing needs, and you want to save a few hundred bucks, and you have a least a little sophistication with computers, you can't beat the value here.
Just got the little machine and the weight is great and size is very thin. Was very hopeful the experience was going to continue.Then I turned it on. As usual these vendors put on bloatware and other stuff that make it, for most novices, impossible to use. I first had to start by disabling an Intel PPT Re-certification process that was consistently taking up 40-80% of the CPU. Still need to look into how to properly turn this off because it starts up on reboot via some service. Updates for Win10 Build 1709 were not coming down either (though most likely a Windows issue). In the end I had to rebuild the machine with Win10 1709 I have available on USB.I shudder to think what a novice would do with this machine. One nice little app though... Acer Care Center allowed me to easily backup the factory build and drivers.
These Acer computers are a waste of money. Just save for something you know will last. I have had mine under a year and already it is giving me problems with regular functions, loading, and space. I use a portable hard drive for all documents/photos/music and save nothing to my actual computer yet this system claims to be full on memory and lags tremendously after minimal use. Save your money!!! Do not bother with any Acer product as they are low quality and low performance.
I am fairly disappointed with what i got with Acer, at least for an inexpensive model. Of the supposed 32 GB of memory, almost all (above 80%) is used with system files or other preloaded things, leaving me virtually no memory to play with. After deleting every app that the computer allowed me to delete, i had the ability to download maybe one desired app. If i downloaded 2 then there wasn't even enough free memory for the computer to update. For me this was an utter waste of money, but I'll admit that if you just need a laptop to browse the web and never plan on saving anything to the actual computer... Well, this would possibly work. On the other hand, a few security updates down the road and you might find yourself in the same boat with all the memory filled up. I guess you get what you pay for, but i don't think it is ethical to sell a computer that is basically unusable.
This is my third Acer computer and I am really a fan of the brand for the price. This is what I would describe as a simple, mid range laptop in terms of capabilities. If you plan to use it for internet browsing and light work you will really like it. It does not otherwise have a lot of memory so forget about running AutoCAD, etc as you would need something more powerful and it is non-upgradeable.Regarding the laptop itself, it is so light. It charges fast but seems to be a 7 out of 10 on battery life. Overall I am really pleased with it.
I borrowed this laptop from my friend for a weekend because he had a program I needed for a project. Itâs perfect for handling basic tasks such as microsoft word, excel, powerpoint, web browsing, watching videos, running basic programs, etc. Itâs much more responsive than my $200 laptop that has a previous generation celeron processor in it. Will likely get this for my dad.
It's hard to get excited about this machine because it's built to meet very basic expectations at a very low price point. I don't know how it compares to laptops selling at the same price or less but I for one am astounded at how much value there is at the price.The top of the laptop is black textured plastic. It's textured kind of like a fabric weave and looks like it will resist scratches, probably better than metal tops do. Overall it is surprisingly light and thin. It has molded raised feet on the bottom that are about 1/8" thick. Without those it would be even thinner but they probably help with cooling.I could complain about the limited memory and processor speed but I won't because this thing is faster and has almost as much memory as a laptop I used until 2011 which I paid over $1000 for. Considering how cheap plug-in memory is these days (and getting cheaper) it's easy to spend between $20 and $100 and get additional memory from a 32gb usb up to a 1000gb external usb drive.Even though external memory is cheap, this laptop won't win any races rendering video and probably won't run a lot of games at a satisfactory speed. If all you need to do is poke around on the internet, word processing and basic photo editing type things however it is very adequate. It also comes with Windows 10 for the price of some laptops which run free operating systems. I've been using Windows 10 for over a year now and find it mostly trouble free and intuitive.The keyboard and mousepad are unimpressive but serviceable.While I do think this is a great value, you could easily spend a little more and get a laptop that looks and feels nicer and has more onboard memory.
For the price, I was really pleasantly surprised by this computer. It looks good, runs well, has good battery life, keyboard is easy to use and responsive, setup was a breeze. This is a great first computer for a high school or college student, or for someone who does most of their work online "in the cloud." It doesn't have a ton of RAM or hard drive space, so you can't install and run very complicated programs on this. But, if most of what you use a computer for is Facebook or online games or Google documents, you can't get much better than this.That having been said, I want to reiterate that this is an inexpensive entry level laptop. So, any bad points to the computer are because it is inexpensively made. The screen is good, but not great, and I wouldn't expect to have HD clarity when watching movies. It does come with a front facing camera, but the camera picture is really not good. I found it to be very blurry and grainy. If all you are doing is using Skype to talk to your friends or whatever, the camera is fine.Overall though, it's a solid computer for the price point.
Acer Aspire 1 a114-31-c4hh Notebook is a light weight, low cost laptop. Its dark charcoal carbonate body is slim and a reasonable size for portability versus yesteryear's models. The 14 inch screen displays an impressive high definition resolution. It has HDMI, USB 3.0 x1 and USB 2.0 x2 ports, headphone port, WiFi (2.4 Ghz and 5G), Bluetooth 4.0 and all the basics one would expect from recent laptops. It comes with 4 gigs of ram and a quad core Celeron N3450, is power efficient, and can bump up to a 2.2 Ghz speed when needed. The graphics, based on Intel technology, are exceptional. The sound-quality of the from the speakers are also impressive â?loud, clear and articulated eliminating the need for a side device such as in-line Bluetooth speakers.Windows 10 comes installed on this model. I'm not a big fan of Windows and didn't expect much from its performance-wise (to say the least). That turned out incorrect. I found that Win10 was quite snappy for all basic computing -- office, surfing, streaming. It comes with some bloat like recommended programs and games, but once most of these were uninstalled I was left with about 12 gigs out the box of free hard drive space. Twelve gigs is not much too work with, but this device is designed as a notebook and not an full laptop. I therefore use an SD in for storage.The battery power is better than average, giving many hours of use and virtually no loss during sleep/standby. If this had a number pad, it may have scored higher with me in the office use experience (bad for number crunchers), but the keys are laid out comfortably with great space between each key. One notable deficit in this Acer, however, is very slow downloads over WiFi. I compared its download speeds via WiFi with those of other notebooks and computers in my home to the detriment of the Acer. Fortunately the Acer has a Ethernet I use for great speeds via that connection.I highly recommend this machine for professional types and people who want a reliable device that provides all the essentials of everyday computing need. I would rank it as a particularly good choice for those on a budget â?it performs at the level of a more expensive machine. It's not for those who expect more internal space for
I had this laptop for almost 6 months. It is a nice design. But the keyboard had a couple useless keys at the end of the right. It can run basic apps and animation apps well. Gaming is not that great, but is still OK. It is a little slow sometimes. I only get 12 GB storage after Windows 10 Installation. When I accidentally hit my iPhone to the laptop screen, it had a tiny crack between where I hitted it. Trackpad is really horrible and can not work once in a while because it is creaky and slippery. Overall, this is a good basic laptop for normal usage.
The Acer Aspire 1 is at the very most, average. There is nothing special about it. No special features, no amazing screen, everything is just okay. You might be able to justify this at $200 but you could defiantly find a better option for $200 (both used and new). The one thing that is decent is the speakers on the device, they are nice speakers, decent volume, and work fairly well. Saying that, that is probably the best thing I can say about the laptop. This computer seems to be mainly for online use. Even if this is true why not get something like a chrome book which optimizes the chrome browser (my personal day to day browser) much better. Some Chromebook models even have the Google Play Store. Surprisingly the build feels pretty sturdy, its no metal build but it feels pretty solid for $200. If not assumed before, gaming is a definite no for this laptop. Sure, web flash based games will work fine, but anything that requires anything slightly more than this will not work. Many application launchers for games will not even load. If you manage to get a game to load then you will instantly notice the hardware for the laptop. Yes, the hardware is okay for online use but will just not allow you to play any moderately, heavy game. Online use is pretty nice but opening any more than 10 tabs and you will get hit with a low ram message thanks to the very small 4gb of ram. Oh, and don't get me started on the 32gb of storage. Once you first set the computer you will have around 26gb of storage. After installing the new version of windows, downloading 2 or 3 small programs, and downloading 2 windows apps I had less than 5gb of storage. I am not giving this computer such a hard time, just because it cant play any games, but because it is not even good at what it is advertising to do- web browsing. Having all that said, the laptop is not terrible, it is just for a very small audience who need a little laptop to do very little web browsing. I am not part of that audience. You can't bash the laptop too much seeing that it is only $200 but if I were you, I would save my money to buy a more expensive laptop.P.S .. The battery lasts for a very long time on this laptop, but the few nice features are not enough to justify spending $200 on it.Acer Aspire 1, 14" Full HD, Intel Celeron N3450, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage, Windows 10 Home, A114-31-C4HH
Starting out, it was great. After about 6 months, it started to run out of space. It didnât make any sense to me. I donât store ANYTHING on this laptop. I keep everything on an external hard drive. Only thing I downloaded was a video editing software and Google Chrome. So I reset it back to factory settings to get rid of everything. A month later, running out of storage space. Iâve reset it and still runs out quickly. Now that it needs to update Windows, it needs more room to add the program. It needs more space than is possible. Iâve reset this damn laptop to factory setting so many times jut to keep it from having updates requires pop up. Even if I reset it to factory setting and NOTHING is on it, there still isnât enough room available to update. I hate this stupid thing. I wish I never bought it.
Got is has a gift for someone and they love it! Nothing but good feedback on the laptop. Since Iâm not personally using it I canât give much details other than it runs good, the screen is big and clear and itâs use for day to day things
Just got this, and the hdd isn't even big enough to update windows. Which makes it unsafe to use on the internet. It wouldn't be that bad if you could replace the tiny 32gb hdd, but it's not upgradable.
As a straight purchase, upgrade to the SSD version as the HD version performs poorly with a lot of lag just the Win10 environment. Lag was down right annoying in applications.The Bad:I had purchased this based on the empty m.2 SSD slot for an extra drive; however, the m.2 slot is not supported with the BIOS that ASUS has loaded on the MB. When I contact ASUS, I got mixed results. But when it was clear to them I was wanting to use the m.2 slot, it became all 'please use a professional certified upgrader', etc. Further help was cut off. This is why I'm docking 2-stars.Based on tips online and some off-the-script guidance from ASUS, I tried reinstalling Win10 on the HD with no noticable improvment. Ultimately ended up installing a 2.5" SSD and reinstalling Win10 as it was past the return period and all the troubleshooting I had done pretty much blocked a return anyways.The Good:Empty memory slot makes it easy to double RAM to 16GB. And I had no issues with RAM upgrade.ASUS support was good on helping with a track pad issue (BIOS update) and which 2.5" SSD's could be installed.With the new 2.5" SSD and Win10 freshly installed, this is a great laptop. Lag begone! No lag issues in O365, and I am even running Lightroom without issues. Battery life is good. Web-browsing and O365 apps seem to get 4-6 hours per charge. LR burned through a charge in <2 hours, but it's LR, right? No issues with heat build up. Unit runs cool, even in LR. I am going to try loading up a few games to see how they run.This unit is not bulky due to the thin bezel around the screen. It feels more like a 14" computer, but the screen view is 'huge'. The graphics look nice for a laptop and definitely top-notch in this price range. The case feels a little flimsy. Opening things up, it is clear there is not much stiffening material in the case/shell. But I am not hard on my electronics (I don't expect them to survive a two-story drop unharmed). I do not expect to have issues beyond normal wear. The weight is light enought that I would compare it to the Mac Airbook it is replacing (yes, I went Apple for a bit, but I'm back folks!). The small charger unit is a bonus too. This will not take up much room in any bag.Final Word:OK, master plan to get a powerhouse laptop for less than $1000 was not totally realized. But with the SSD and a stick of memory, this is a great iCore7 laptop for the money. Advice to potential buyers: go ahead and get the SSD version.
Surprisingly well optioned for the price. Light weight. Very fast. Shipping was quick and packaging was adequate to protect during shipping. Only draw back is that the power button is located right next to the delete button. It is annoying when typing and you accidentally hit the power button. Other than that little complaint, LOVE working on this machine.
Nice computer, however, no backlight for keyboard, or num lock/ caps lock indicator.
*LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS!! THIS IS A BUDGET LAPTOP, NOT A GAMING LAPTOP*Read this ^^ , Read it again..Now that you've seen this disclaimer let me just say this.. I was in the very same position you are in right now but only a few days ago. Coming from an Intel Core i3 DESKTOP, this laptop has proven to be everything and anything I would want for a laptop at this price point. This laptop comes with an Intel Core i7 CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce 940MX GPU. A full 1920 x 1080 HD screen, if you are coming from excellence this laptop is good. If you come from trash this laptop will be the world to you. That being said, there are some cons as with any piece of technology. This laptop suffers from Slow Start.. and no I do not mean the Pokemon ability :D . This computer seems to have an issue downloading and installing the newest version of Windows 10 during startup. After all the updates on this laptop is made, it is great, fast and beautiful. It's almost MacBook-ish in it's sleek design (it has better speakers though :) ). At the end of the day I can only do so much, the choice is ultimately yours to make. That being, I DOUBT you can find another laptop at this price point that is better than this.
This laptop is was so cool. I was able to multi task while working online as an ESL teacher. I can run a lot of application and it responded really fast. It can also get the highest internet connection from the broadband. It is really lightweight and the sound it was loud, louder than my old hp notebook.It was more than what I was expecting for. It even has an automatic installment of windows and there was like a bot that recognizes my voice the first to help me with the installation of the windows. I thought its gonna be hard to use the windows 10 but I was mistaken. It can also sustain a gameplay especially in LoL.One thing that disappointed me was the longetivity of the battery which was stated like "8h battery life (full working day)" but the charge is only lasting for 4hrs. NOTE: The battery is not detachable.By the way, I appreciated amazon in giving back the express fee I spent for this, since it had a delay in the delivery.
Love it, price worth this device, recommend update hard disk to SSD, performance is good, even under heavy load laptop not make load noise.
This laptop exceeded my expectations. It is very light weight. I have carried it in my camera bag and did not even realize it was there. It is very fast. I can do Lightroom and Photoshop editing on it with ease. The 1 TB hard drive is plenty roomy. I have all 12,000 of my digital photos on it with plenty of room to spare. I only wish it had an SSD, but I can always add one later.I probably use this laptop 10-12 hours a day, every day and I have not had the first problem with it.
I didnât believe other customers complaning about windows taking forever to update; it took over 10 hours (I went to sleep, so it could be more time) to complete the update, recommendation downlod the iso file from microsoft instead.Overall a lightweight and great laptop; second recommendation upgrade to SSD, I also bought the crucial micron m..500; super easy to install and the improvement is noticeable from start.No ethernet port, if you are planning on using it with Wi-fi only is ok, you can get an usb (2.0 or 3.0) to ethernet adapter if needed.
I'll never go back to anything less than i7 processor and a ssd. Replaced a 4 year old Lenovo i5, what a huge difference in speed! Restarts are so quick, fit and function of this Asus is great. Price is excellent for this level of computing. I use a voice recognition program which is buggy and demanding and this computer handles it like a champ. I do wish Asus was clearer about which computers use which chargers as I always buy a backup charger for home use. It's tough to match from the item description, but I found one for this. Very happy.
So far its a great laptop and I would buy another one identical to it if I needed another.
It's perfect. The only thing i didnt like was the speed of the hard disk and the low pixel camera.I really recomend this laptop
Super fast computer with SSD Drive, great value
Great design and keyboard and awesome sound for a laptop.
Fast processor and Video card....very Good Laptop!
Runs great, has a cheap feel but that should be expected at this price considering the quality of the internals. My only real gripe is the size of the right shift button and placement of the up arrow key. I work with spreadsheeets all day and I've accidentally clicked the up arrow when going for the shift key quite often. Other than the very poor placement of the up key, this is a very quality machine at this price point.Another note is the screen isn't a bright and glossy screen like most but I prefer that.
Extremely finicky. Don't get HDD version.
Unless you're desperate for a cheap/decent spec computer, avoid this laptop like the plague. This computer is so poorly designed despite it being a budget computer. I've mostly been working on a PC tower, and it never occurred to me how important knowing when Capslock is on. Its really frustrating having to go into notepad, just to see if your typing in your password correctly.At the same time, I also really hate the laptop charger. It feels loose, and the charger will disconnect at the slightest touch. Even with my older laptops, I always knew it was making a snug fit. Not for this laptop.Those are my two biggest pet peeve that honestly would have been a dealbreaker if I had known prior.
It's uncomfortably slow as Windows 10 works fast only on SSD, so better get the SSD version (I'm going to install it as well)
The HDD in this laptop is absolutely disgustingly bad. Every other part in it is fine but a bad HDD ruins it all.
It's a really good laptop after a hard drive upgrade to an m.2. I wouldn't label this laptop under gaming mainly because of the battery not the graphics card. It can do light gaming but once you spend a good 30 mins in a game you're already near about 30% left. I guess that's why it has fast charging.
It's a very decent laptop for the price. Specs are great except for the HDD, if possible, swap it as soon as you get the chance. (Preferably an SSD) I have not been able to use this computer properly, the HDD usage is at 100% all the time. Ordered a m.2 SSD and a 2TB Seagate drive with 128MB cache.
This computer is the slowest and most terrible computer I have ever used. I have owned it for several months and had problems with it for the beginning. It literally took 3 hours for it to download everything it needed to get set up which is insane. It also had a faulty keyboard and the speakers were messed up. About a month ago it got the blue screen of death due to some configuration issues but luckily I'm still under manufacturer warranty so I'm sending it out to Asus hoping they send me something different. I'm also lucky my boyfriend got an Hp computer for me to use for school which by the way only took a few minutes to get set up and has been working really well so far it also saved my life because as a college student you can't go without a computer for long!
This PC is absolutely amazing AFTER you replace the garbage HDD that comes with it with an SSD. Runs games on close to ultra settings perfectly fine.Like I said though the only real problem is the Hard drive it comes with. Absolutely atrocious and unusable. Other then that.. Im very happy with my purchase.
I hate writing bad reviews for products, but this one should be warned about.I didn't think it was too bad when I first bought it. It seemed like a nice little computer that could do about what I wanted.Out of the box this machine seems to have some sort of issue with the pre-installed windows operating system. It is very slow first off. It took the entire day to get everything ready on the computer.Next was my disliked point. These issues cascaded into the wireless driver, causing the machine to not recognize any wireless internet at all! This would kick me from any game that I would be playing, mess up other things, and give me a hard time. I tried everything to fix this issue, but nothing came about. I shouldn't have to go through these issues with a "new" computer.Overall, very slow working even with the i7 processor, and issues galore with the operating system. I would not recommend this buy.
Would give it a five if it had backlit keyboard. It doesn't cost a fortune to include the backlit keyboards in all ASUS laptops. Trust me, people will pay for it. The feel is also somewhat cheep (maybe because you cheaped out on backlit keyboards), but despite looks, it works as expected.The fan makes weird noises, and starts working whenever I open IE to read some newsIf you are planning to buy this laptop, make yourself a favor, and get some SSD, it will do wonders to performance
Tons of deck play. The keyboard sunk in a lot and I felt it was not durable.
The computer operates well. But actually I asked for a grey one.
I've only had this laptop for a few days, so at some point I may come back and update this review. However, for now I wanted to give a review based on my experience after first using the computer. Right out of the box this thing ran slower than a 3 year old Samsung Satellite that I picked up on here for about $500.This Asus was so brutally slow out of the box it took me 2.5 hours to install Adobe Creative Suite from an installer I downloaded! Even before the install it would take almost 2 minutes to open Windows and launch any software.Before I did a return I decided to re-install Windows. After the the computer ran like a normal computer. Although it still seemed a little slow for an i7 with 8 gigs of RAM. But, overall everything is running much better.So it looks like whatever software ASUS is pre-installing on this thing is terrible. Please ASUS do something about your pre-loaded software. Your laptops are rated pretty highly, but something like this is terrible!
Too freaking slow
Terrible Laptop. Windows that came with it was not authenticating. After buying a new Windows License it worked for around a month and now it won't boot up. It keeps going into automatic repair. Over the course of the month performance was slow and MS Word kept crashing. I have tried to factory reset it and it doesn't work. I'm not an amateur user and work on the electronics and computers field. This was just a bad laptop or I was very unlucky with this purchase.
Very slow so I checked the task manager and it was showing 100% disk usage even when the computer was not doing any operations. So I checked online and found that this could sometimes be caused by bugs in the Windows 10 operating system. I tried debugging it by turning off file indexing and superfetch etc. Eventually I re-installed the whole operating system and still was getting the same thing so now I've returned it. Laptops are supposed to work right out of the box!
The computer I received today has already restarted 3 times saying there was an error. I haven't downloaded anything harmful, only game capture programs and editting programs and in the first day this has happened
Battery life is really weak.
The item arrived on time and in excellent condition. My wife and I are very satisfied with this laptop.
Disappointment. Laptop processing is slow and with frequent freezes. Returning this item.
IT will not let me update to windows 10 ,tried several times totally disappointed for the money I spent,I keep getting error codes .At this point I would not recommend buying this laptop .Just got this for Christmas
i have a problem whit touchpad
The computer deos not work... it doesnât even turn no ð¡
Crappy stuff. Wireless connection is defective out of the box. I am on 50 Mbps up/down network. This one hardly gets to 1-2 Mbps download. Upload is 20 Mbps though. Reinstalling/updating the wireless adapter driver did not help. Anyway, that's a shame, returning it.
DON'T BUY THIS COMPUTER!!! There are plenty computers out there for the same price, but MUCH better quality. First of all it took 24 hours for initial update, after that it restarted multiple times for more stupid updates. Second, it is super laggy, the processing speed of this computer even with i7 is laughable. Additionally, this computer is LOUD!!! Not that the speakers are loud, but the fact that you can hear it working and processing, I never had such a noisy computer in my life. It's just terrible. Please don't buy this. It is really not a good computer.
As a designer I thought this would be a nice computer to do my work but it isnât. Itâs way too slow, even without any program opened. And I donât know why, itâs supposed to be fast.... I mean itâs new... I tried to work with only one program opened and internet and it was hell. I got frustrated...
Honestly this is the worst laptop Iâve ever purchased on Amazon. I get itâs a budget laptop and I do understand you get what you pay for but if Iâm paying for a $700 laptop with an i7 and a graphics card; Iâd like it to at least run one tab of google chrome without crashing. Literally my ENTIRE laptop crashes just by opening chrome. Ridiculous I will be returning this and never buying ASUS again. Straight up BS
I love the Asus brand and this computer is also well spec'd. The bad rating goes to Amazon as they say Windows 10 which i assume meant Windows 10 Pro as all the other ones on the comparison table stated Windows 10 Home. I now have a Windows 10 home addition for a business and will need to pay another huge sum for Windows 10 pro. Amazon that is a very poor mistake and a costly one to me.Review updated to 4 stars from 2 due to acceptable response. thank you.
Not good to have only 2 USB ports
This is a really good computer in terms of performance. Feels way faster than 8 gig. I can't say the same for logic of the ports included. If I need VGA I'll buy an adapter. Excellent battery life. Average Screen.
Fast and quiet. Only complaint is the screen color is a bit flat.
Iâve never written a negative review like this so take it with a grain of salt... I opened the box and setup this laptop and couldnât be less impressed. To be fair, Iâm going from a Lenovo Yoga 900 series that start at twice as much (broken charging port, risky and cost prohibitive to have repaired). This doesnât feel light as it says at all to me. I was sure even without adding SSD storage the processor would be impressive. Nope. Iâve never owned an Asus and Iâm not impressed with what I consider flaws. Unfortunately they add up. For the money itâs probably amazing, but I donât think it will blow anyone away by any means.
Loud fan noise, i7 works like i3 (idk why) , Great display, Sleek design.Just a normal laptop with i7 and 940MX.Display is wow only because of the nano edge display.Multi tasking a bit slow. 5 hours of battery ( normal use )
Very good buy.
LOVE IT! It cold boots in 2 seconds or maybe less...it is quick...graphics are great. No issues.
This is a great computer. Even though it is refurbished, it looks nearly new, with microscopically small imperfections. Less wear than I would put on it in a week or two. It arrived well packaged and I picked it up at the store, which was very fast. It booted up perfectly and runs well.
I bought this as an emergency purchase, as it was finals week and I was low on funds. I needed something affordable that was able to do internet functions and basic MS office, and this fits wonderfully! It is also light and compact, making it a good choice if you want to take it with you for note-taking or working outside of home. As far as gaming, I've only run Terraria, but it handles it okay; there's just not a lot of free memory space to store much else.I ended up being frustrated with this computer for a bit due to Microsoft's massive GB requirements for updates, but was able to mitigate this by purchasing a 16GB USB Drive. It was tricky getting Microsoft to recognize that drive to accomplish the update (a problem on their end). Fortunately USB drives are affordable now.
I've had this laptop for about 6 weeks now and have to say that I haven't had any problems thus far. The laptop arrived in perfect (refurbished but couldn't tell) condition. It was a great price and I would recommend doing business with these guys
Looks and works like new! Very fast delivery. Comes with battery and charger. Very light weight. Using this for school. Will be perfect!
It works great and looks like new but has a very small hard drive and no cd drive. It is listed in the description so it's totally as described.
I have been a fan of this model laptop for a while, which is part of why I was so upset when I opened the box, only to find a laptop that looked NOTHING like the laptop pictured. Instead, its blue, it overheats WAY faster, I'm already having problems with the OS, the HDMI/USB ports arent in the same spot, the charging port is on the other side, and it is much thinner than the SAME laptop I ordered 6 months ago...I'm just so disappointed. I NEED a laptop for my work and livelihood, and if I did the return process, i wouldn't be able to do my job for at least a week, and would definitely be hit financially...this just seems like a huge oversight. It would be one thing if this were just a keyboard or a mouse, but this laptop just does NOT perform as well as the same model I purchased half a year ago. Overall VERY disappointed, annoyed...I wouldn't buy from this seller if they dont even make an effort to send the right looking item...
Perfect working condition!! Great for school! Thank you!!
So far works great! Wish it had a little more solid state HD memory but the price was right.
This PC will not work with windows 10. The Drive 30 g is to small to handle the window 10 continued updates making a mess. I tried it and it was terrible but I converted to linux Mint and it now works great as a Linux machine.
So far itâs working awesome and is very fast, just what I needed for portable Windows and the price was the best.Make no mistakes, this is NOT a netbook, it runs full on windows and can keep up with a laptop twice itâs price
Working perfect! Simple, and good for internet proposing!
came defective. however, company accepted the return without problem
So far so good, if it stays this way it will be fantastic!!
Cheap. Slow. And worthless.
The size was exactly what I was looking for but the memory was very low
The most basic of laptops, but I specifically hate this one because it constantly makes a high pitched beep all the time whenever the battery is in it, even if it's powered off
Does everything I need it to. A little lacking on storage, buy at least two 16gig flash drives to update Windows.
Part of my family got this laptop as a surprise gift for my mum's friend. She was really grateful and appreciated it. When I got to use it, it was relatively nice to use.
Good quality and a fair price. Shipped quickly. I'm pleased with the computer.
It kept giving the message no storage. Came with installed games from previous owner.
It works fairly well and is fast. Just lacks memory so I would recommend an external hard rice bc you will need to update it almost every other week.
Came with a spazzy touchpad/cursor that moved everywhere erratically and clicked on things randomly. Was impossible to use. Returning it.
Works perfect. Great color on screen. Grand daughter love's it.
Works like a dream, but A LOT of updates. Recommend getting a USB drive for it. <3 <3
it is very light and so nice and slick looking. it was gift to my son for Christmas and he loves it.
Bought it for my sister in Nigeria and she loves it!
Great laptop! I've had it for several months now! And it's still perfect!
Love. Amazing for the price
Like new. No problems!
Received it very promptly. Machine runs great.
I love it!!!!-so far so good-no issues!!!
Was iffy on buying a laptop online but this thing runs great. Have had no problems at all! Couldn't be happier
Hi: I checked item described by seller as "no" for the following reason. The computer system was described as tested for functionality. But this is not a functional computer/system because the system cannot handle the Windows 10 OS. When I first received this computer and set it up I added Google Chrome, a Libre software package and my Samsung printer and of course set it up wirelessly with my modem/router and it worked. But as soon as the first window update occurred I starting receiving disk nearing storage capacity messages. I have had the computer now for about 1.75 mos and I have repeatedly received disk at capacity messages that tell me to save my work immediately, close and restart the computer and delete enough files from storage to free up adequate space for the system to function. I moved all of my personal files to my MS One Drive and cleared out anything pre-installed non-essential programs. Within little time it again reached the disk capacity. I have come to the conclusion that I will shortly be unable to use the computer at all, so I am returning it. Why was a Windows 10 OS put in a computer that had inadequate storage for it to run bare bones. This system might work fine with a Chrome-book OS but certainly not a Windows 10 OS. The configuration of this computer is defective. I should not be charged a 15% restocking fee and the personal cost of shipping to return the computer to Amazon.Frustrated and Disappointed in Minnesota.
For a refurbished laptop this is in great condition. I can play games and do all my school work. My kids can do school work and play games on this. I can utilize multiple tabs and browsers open if I choose. Pretty great laptop. Would buy again.
I like the pc it is usable for any website but note it is slower than normal pc .after all this is the cheapest pc u can pins and note :downloading files or games are not a option.if u want to play games steam games are technically not a option if it is lower than 5 gb because even though the pc have 32 gb it have literally 25 gb for the settings so u can barely download anything on maximum 3 gaming app is lucky I canât barely even download 1 game on it so if u are looking for gameing not recommended but if cheapest and usable for searching that does not require downloading it is recommended
I love everything about it
just got it today, came in perfect condition. Will update if anything is up - 5 stars Day 1
very happy with this product
It worked awsome
I would look elsewhere for a better price on this particular refurbished HP laptop. Other online vendors have this exact HP laptop refurbished for much less than $183. I should have researched the price before I bought from Amazon. Amazon is not always the cheapest. MSRP is $200. Have not had much time to really get into the performance, but I can say it is really light weight which is a big plus. I would suggest removing HP's bloat ware and other crap installed from 3rd party vendors as this laptop only has 32gb. You can purchase a 64gb USB flush fit flash drive for around $16, well worth the upgrade.
bought this computer in October and it hasnât been able to turn on for a month now. I want a refund! Only gave it one star because I had to but if I could post this without a star I would have
Super good value. Sold as refurb, but seems to be brand new.
Spent a lot on this and did not even receive a laptop. Got a $20.00 toy in the box instead.
The unit quit updating due to lack of space about a month ago & now has quit entirely! It should have not been sold with such a limited Hard Drive & Windows 10 on it.
This was a total rip off do not buy it. Said that there was 32GB there was only 29GB Available and it could not run without useing10GB
Notebook donât work
I love this little laptop. I used it for blogging and school. It's lightweight and looks brand new. I never would have thought it was refurbished
good laptop
Overall I feel the laptop was not up to our standards for a "new" computer. Runs slow and has a lower quality resolution on the screen.
On the fence about purchasing this laptop? Please continue reading:I was eyeing this laptop for several weeks now. I was hoping to get a good Black Friday or holiday deal on this item but that time never came so I bit the bullet and got it for $199 (which is reasonable).At first glance, this is quite a small laptop. Iâve used 11.6â?laptops before but with the thinness and weight, I was somewhat surprised by the size and worried that the keyboard would be hard to type on. It did take about two hours of consistent typing for me to get used to this thing. I type a lot of research papers and this is one of the more responsive keyboard laptops Iâve used. Of course, not macbook quality but definitely better than the other budget laptops on the market. Compared to my 13.3â?ASUS chromebook, the keys on this model are more cramped together and smaller in size. However, it is surprisingly nicer to type on and isnât mushy like the former.As far as battery life goes, I started at 100% estimated usage time of 12hrs. I did a full update, streamed 30mins of video, played 2hrs of pandora, downloaded a bunch of apps and installed google chrome. After all of that, and approximately 3hours later, I still have 62% battery left. I imagine that it will live up to the advertised battery life with normal use. At most, the laptop has gotten slightly warm, not enough to bother anyone should you choose to to use it on your lap though.Memory and performance. OK, this is largely the reason why I was wary of purchasing this laptop. It comes with minimal storage. After all the updates, I was left with 16gb of SSD. I did purchase a 64gb micro sd card for this laptop and all it took was changing storage preferences to get everything directed to the SD card. I did experience some trouble at first as the storage settings did not save for some reason and I had to redirect everything to the micro SD twice. It appears to be working properly now though and apps download relatively fast on this thing. I currently have 16 tabs open on Google Chrome (yes, I am that person) and everything is still running smoothly. The only lag that Iâve experienced was using the Edge on this machine. Do NOT use edge! Just download google chrome and save yourself the trouble.Display and Build quality: Again, this is a very thin and lightweight laptop made out of entirely plastic, so it feels somewhat cheap. But I think the design and aesthetics may make up for that. At a glance, it looks like itâs made out of aluminum. I wonât go into what color it is, as it varies depending on the lighting. But it appears to be a more expensive product than it really is. The screen itself is actually pretty nice for the price. Itâs not going to stream HD videos well but itâs definitely not an eyesore either. Another thing I should point out is that the black bezel on the screen is indeed plastic. (For some reason I thought it was going to be glass.) As far as ports go, all of them are in working order. I did have trouble with the USB 2.0 port as it was rather snug which made inputting and removing USBs rather difficult and with excessive force, unfortunately. Iâm not sure if this will be a long term issue or if it will fail on me in the long run but Iâm optimistic.Overall, this is a nice inexpensive laptop that will exceed expectations for anyone simply needing a laptop for essay-typing, web-browsing, and light weight tasks. It is extremely portable and is a great option for people looking to travel with a laptop. For the price and performance, it's worth it.
OK, so I was eyeballing this laptop for 2 weeks. Each time I wanted to order it the stock/shipping option on Amazon was not very appealing. However, I guess I got lucky, and I ordered it on Saturday 10/15/2016 (when was in stock) and received this laptop today 10/18/2016.Pros (for me) :- lightweight- good battery life- good speakers- good travel size- good for watching movies and web browsing- Windows 10 64 bit , 4 GB RAM, microSD port, fast A/C WiFi- casting videos to smart TVCons: (based on my opinion)- Hard drive is small - usable space is around 14 GB, 64GB would be perfect; but, this one is not a biggest issue for me - 128GB micro-SD card or USB are cheap.- USB ports only 2 - additional USB 3.0 port would be awesome.Bottom line :For $199 it is a pretty good laptop for basic computing i.e watching videos, playing music, web browsing, and basic office/college tasks.Not sure about gaming.
Great little computer for writing papers, browsing the web, and watching videos. Very convenient for college students and travelers because the size and weight. I'm satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a computer for using Microsoft products, YouTube, social media and light gaming.
Fantastic computer if you buy it with the right expectations. It's $200. It's not fast, but it's also not as slow as I thought it'd be.It has no problems streaming YouTube or Netflix in HD. I'm able to have a bunch of tabs open in Chrome with no noticeable slowdown. I've even used it to edit 24-megapixel photos in GIMP while traveling. It's around 4-5 times slower than my screaming fast i7 desktop computer when performing CPU-intensive photo manipulation functions, but again, this laptop is $200. It's also able to run emulators up to the PlayStation 1 era with no issues.It's plastic painted to look like metal (I guess that's just the style these days) but it feels well built -- less squishy than my previous cheap laptop. Looks more silver than gold in my opinion, and that's a good thing. It looks professional. I wouldn't feel self-conscious taking notes on this thing at a conference, unlike other whimsically colored laptops at this price point marketed towards college students. Some people may be able to rock the vivid purple laptop look, but I am sadly not one of them. The chiclet style keyboard is great too.I'm saving the best for last: it has 10+ hours of battery life even with moderate-to-heavy use. It has lasted entire flights across the country on half a charge. I've never owned a laptop that could do that before.
I absolutely love this laptop. It's super lightweight and fits into all of my bags. It comes with Windows 10 a free year of Microsoft Office which is nice. There's not a lot of room on the hard drive but if you use Microsoft One this shouldn't be an issue. Trackpad was a little finicky at first but it seems to have sorted itself out once I altered the pressure of my fingers. Additionally, the color in my opinion, is closer to rose gold than actual gold, which is actually really nice.
So far, so good! Arrived very nicely in its little box. Streamlined design, extremely easy set up, regular updates. I purchased usb storage as I knew it didn't come with much. It has very pretty display, high quality images, and it is quick. I run my business from home and basically anywhere that I am. I love that I can slide this in my purse and run. Battery life is fantastic.
This review is specifically for the 14" L402-WA-EH21.First off, a little bit of background: I am a computer person. I build, rebuild, and maintain computers both in professional and personal life.The Good Things-This computer is light weight, easy to use, feels good to type on, and starts fairly quick. Everything about this PC is built specifically to be lightweight and slim. It is specifically built to do web browsing, emailing, instant messaging, and lightweight document creation. Think of it like a Chromebook but running windows. Youtube videos run smooth, network (while n compatible, ac-based) is wifi is zippy but wired is faster, and the screen is bright and vivid (with the right settings). If you are student that needs a budget document creation tool, this will do it. If you need a computer to quickly look up information, close and toss around the living room, or send emails to grandma; this machine will do it.It also has a 2.5" harddrive bay in a cover under the bottom of the laptop (not advertised but it's there). I have installed (and highly recommend) a 250gb ssd for the additional storage space (and if you are going to be doing any type of heavy document creation, you will need the space). It works fine without reducing battery life.At the moment, the longest I have used it was 3 hours before plugging it in, but that was because I was leaving for several hours. probably would have made 4 before having to plug it in.The Not-So-Good Things-The L402WA-EH21 has no documentation online, has no specs listed through the ASUS website, and apparently doesn't exist other than it is listed on Amazon for sale. The closest model is the E402WA on the ASUS site and comes in two different versions (i think the E is Intel based, the L is AMD based). Given that you are considering purchasing this laptop, all the documentation that you will have will come in the box; a basic start up manual, a warranty card, a small bag of screws (for the harddrive expansion bay), and a power supply.The Bad Things-I received this laptop and plugged it in and fired it up. Standard Windows set up and logged into the desktop. Always first thing to do is to check that Windows activated itself properly. It did not. Alright, so I thought there might be a problem with the OS that was installed on it, so I restored the system using the builtin restoration partition (takes about 45 minutes). I redid the Windows set up, and waited. Same information was stored in the restoration partition as was in the original install. Windows wouldn't activate.Alright, being a computer guy, I dug out the tools and scanned the keys that were installed from Asus. The version of Windows installed was 10Home, the key installed through BiOS/UEIF was a 10RTMCore, and had an origin key of 10RTMCloud. All three of these keys are for different versions, none of which are interchangeable with each-other.If you research the OS that is suppose to be installed on this computer (Windows 10S) you will find that it is identical and interchangeable with W 10Pro. Being a computer guy, I wiped the boot drive and installed Windows 10Pro from a flash drive (takes about 45 mins), did the Windows set up, had the OS pull the key from BiOS ... Windows not active...!At this point I was at a loss as what to do. I did a few activation tricks and called Microsoft Activation to see if i could manually activate Windows 10Pro. Talking to a Third Tier Tech (first two were impatient and useless, about 45 minutes being bounced around), the Tech checked the three keys that I had. The W 10H key was already registered and in use (so dead), and the W 10RTMCore and 10RTMCloud had not called home properly. YES! Two keys were available, one of them was no longer viable. Here's the nail in the coffin, I asked the Tech where I could get a ISO (the installer disk) for Windows 10 S (10RTMCloud). His exact answer "Unfortunately, there is no way for you to get ahold of a 10S ISO image. They are distributed directly to manufacturers only." ... Great... Just great...So... After all of that I had a brand new key, a new laptop, and no way to put the OS on it that it was suppose to be installed! Mind you, this is five hours into taking it out of the box. I finally was just about to throw it back in and ship it back when I decided to dig around in Google.So... after about an hour, I found a fix. It's complicated, it's doable if you are moderately computer savvy, and have about two hours of time; no software needed to be stolen or borrowed from illegitimate sources or anything.1. Get a Windows 10Pro image set and ready on a flashdrive and bootable.2. Install 10 Pro onto the laptop WITHOUT changing any partition information (simply delete the OS partition and stall Windows 10Pro in its place) and bypass the key entry section during install.3. Once the computer is set up and running at the desktop, check to see if the key has Activated. IF IT HAS YOU ARE FINISHED. If not, continue.4. If Windows 10Pro did not activate, you need to find the installer for W 10S. You cannot obtain an ISO, you must use an 'Upgrade' like installer. The webpage to search for is "Test Windows 10 S on existing Windows 10 education devices". Read most of the page so you know what you're getting into, and download the installer.5. Run the installer. It will do an 'Upgrade' install, move all of the associated profile information to a Windows.old folder on the C drive, and install Windows 10S.6. Alright, you've done this step before. Go through the Windows 10 set up.7. Once you get to the desktop, check to see if Windows 10S has been activated. At this point, Windows 10 pulled the key from the BiOS/UEIF and registered properly!8a. At this point you are ready to run. Go ahead and use the laptop as you want. You will need to run DiskCleanup as administrator to wipe out the Windows 10Pro files that are completely useless and just taking up the tiny storage.8b.If you plan on installing any software that is not Windows 10S verified (through the Windows Store) to be lightweight, this laptop HAS the ability to be upgraded to pro through the Store. Search for 'Upgrade to Pro'. It will upgrade you straight away without installing anything else. Everything that Windows 10Pro needs is already in 10S, anything that isn't will need to be downloaded and installed (which if you need them, you will know where to find them in Programs & Features through the Control Panel).Final Thoughts-Generally, I like this lightweight system. It does exactly what I need it to do; run several messengers, word processing, quick internet searches, basic presentations, and occasionally watching Twitch. If you need a small computer, this will do the trick! If you need something to run Photoshop, you will need something more powerful. If this system had of been manufactured with the proper OS on it at the getgo, it would have gotten a 4/5 Star rating... Seriously.... SIX hours of my life are gone because someone in OSImaging didn't get the memo that the BiOS/UEIF had a Windows 10S and not Windows 10Home, or 10RTMCore... If you manage to get this system with Windows 10S and not have to go through a ton of set up, or have the technical ability to do EVERYTHING I did it will be a good lightweight system. At the moment, I cannot confirm that any of the units available have the proper OS on them. I have posted the above information for anyone that might run into the same problem and really REALLY want to give the system a good shot before throwing it back in the box and sending it back.
INTRODUCTIONI bought this laptop, intending to use it for some business consulting work. I was traveling a lot so I figured it would be nice to have a prettylightweight laptop with a full keyboard that I could use to do emails, basic web browsing, and google docs.After receiving the laptop, Windows insisted that I run windows update to ensure the laptop was up to snuff, in terms of required software. After that finished, I used add/remove programs to ensure I didn't have any bloatware to slow the laptop down. Surprisingly, Asus didn't really include a whole lot other than the software required to do smart gestures on the trackpad (good on them for what used to be such an annoyingly common problem with retail PCs).PERFORMANCEInstead of describing how I felt about the way the laptop ran, I will instead describe what happened to this laptop when I operated it under a range of normal use scenarios.Checking Email:Gmail is a little slower to load than on most other PCs I've used. I also experienced an unusual phenomenon while typing in a blank: all keystrokes would take a very long time to register (for instance, if I had typed this sentence, it probably would have taken 10 seconds for the entire sentence to show up after I finished typing it out).Using Google Docs/Spreadsheets:The typing in a blank delay would occur constantly in a Google Spreadsheet, but was not present in a Google Doc.Using an online Messenger (Messenger.com):Delayed typing problem was worst on this site, which led me to believe that the UI was too much for the CPU to handle, affecting the ability of the computer to convert input keystrokes into output letters (this is very surprising, given that the marketing for this computer highlights how many cores the CPU has... I guess number of cores is truly meaningless if text output is a problem).Using Skype Messenger:No issues. I never tried a video call, so I cannot confirm whether any issues existed.Reading Articles Online (News websites, popular online magazines, etc):Probably the worst experience. Page loads were very very long. I can only imagine it is due to all of the complex ads that have taken over websites which demand a lot of resources. Not to mention, ads that loaded videos and started playing...Netflix:Surprisingly, no issues streaming. Navigating the Netflix UI was a little bit laggy, but it was not nearly as bad as some of the online news/magazine sites.Free Trial of Minecraft:I booted up the free trial to see how it performed, and I was shocked. The game runs very smoothly...My only guess is that the game could utilize multiple cores, while internet browsing couldn't take advantage of multiple cores simultaneously.HARDWAREThe laptop is indeed flimsy-ish as many of the other reviews note. However, I would like to say that it was not as flimsy as I expected based on those other reviews. There is a little flex when holding the laptop by one of the sides, but overall, it's decently solid for a $200 machine.The screen was definitely lacking, but better than I expected for the price point. It's glossy, non-touchscreen, backlighting was a great range of bright enough down to dim (for saving battery). I will say that it was not bright enough for the glare from reflections (e.g. if the sun was shining on my shirt and my shirt was a light color, I could clearly see the reflection of my shirt in the screen, even at highest brightness).The keyboard definitely uses membrane switches, which had a nice actuation feel considering how cheap this laptop is. The size of the keys were definitely smaller. The letters/symbols were printed on each key in a really cheap-looking finish. The plastic material that the keys are made out of was definitely low-grade.The trackpad was solid! It was large considering how small the laptop is, had a great feel (was smooth and easy to move about on), and right and left clicks are unmarked but easy to find in the lower right and left quadrants (respectively) of the trackpad. The Asus trackpad software that comes installed knows when you're resting your palms on the trackpad to type, and limits the mouse movement to only input from a finger (it's quite smart..).Webcam: not sure... never video chatted or used the laptop's camera.The form and finish of the laptop are nice. It is NOT metal, but the paint on the plastic does indeed look matte metallic from a distance. The shape was pleasing to hold while closed, and is likely perfect for any 11" Macbook Air slipcase/carrier.OVERALLEverything about the hardware on this laptop makes me wish it performed better. It comes with a one year subscription to Office 365, and excel and word performed adequately. If this computer is for offline use only while traveling, it is probably perfect. I would hazard to guess that most websites design UI assuming most readers are using Macbooks and work PCs... this is certainly not the case. I have returned the PC, and will instead buy a $400 - $1000 ultrabook/2-in-1/macbook that I can use for internet/travel work.
Gorgeous and light weight.I bought this because it's affordable and also because I can easily take it with me anywhere unlike other laptops that may be bigger or heavier.I bought a slim sleeve for it and I can easily slide it into my purse.I love it!
This is the laptop for you.I was going to get a chrome book for the same price but with chromebook, you are limited to a linux software. This is windows and can download most apps. I was able to play counterstrike on here with no lag, on wifi internet. This laptop is the epitome of cheap budget school laptop. Had it for a few months now and its my go-to. WIFI is fast, great graphics for the price and loads everything well. May need to delete some spamware or extra apps you dont need and download google chrome with ghostery and ublock origin; this just completes the laptop. There are ways to increase speed as well.As for the cons, IF i am running some major programs like quick books, MIVA MERCHANT, spotify, chrome, excel, calender, sticky notes, etc at the same time, there is a slight lag. Its not good for data entry that requires real time processing, but great if you need to take notes or watch videos.BTW PLZ BE ADVISED: THIS IS NOT GOLD, MORE LIKE CHAMPAGNE COLOR.TL:DR GREAT LAPTOP, CANNOT RUN MULTI DATA PROCESSING WINDOWS, GREAT FOR VIDEOS OR NOTE TAKING
After 5 months the laptop won't turn on anymore. And according to the Internet, I'm not the only one with this problem. Very disappointing, especially when Asus is not willing to pay the repair freight. Even when the product is under the warranty...
Good laptop at the price.32GB eMMC builtin disk IO ~150MB/sec read and ~75MB/sec writeApprox 14GB disk space free(28GB available) with Win10 OS Build 14393.1480 (5-AUG-2017)256GB Samsung EVO+ U3 MicroSD formatted as exFAT gives ~70MB read and ~40MB write, which is slower than I'd expect with spec'd 95/90MB r/w card802.11ac 1x1 WiFi connects at 433Mbits and provides ~250Mbits real throughput with a LAN binary data transfer which is better than most cheap laptops.Bluetooth 4.1 provides good audio connectivityLaptop build date was 2017-May and battery tested in first few days indicates it already has 10% wear...odd, but will see what it says after a few charge cycles.Keyboard has no back light, but still has a nice touch when two finger typing.The HD display is a bit of a fiddle as you'll find yourself moving the screen back and forward or laptop from side to side to get the best viewing angle. A few degrees make quite a bit of difference on this laptop.The application response is a bit slow if you're used to using gen6 core-i3 processors or better, but still OK when you consider what you paid for this device.Geekbench indicates 988-single and 2536-multiple CPU test and approx 5500 OpenCL GPU test.This is quite good for an Intel Atom x5-Z8350 and Intel HD Graphics 400 GPU.4GB of memory ticks along at ~2GB used, with enough threshold for a few tasks to be open at the same time and responsive.Not uncommon to see 1.9GHz CPU speed with power level-5 on heavy processing.All up a good light laptop with enough response for the average Internet consumer.For the average punter a 64GB eMMC builtin SSD would have rounded out the package as 32GB SSD will be a bit of a challenge for those that don't feel comfortable running cleanups on the Winsxs folder and/or managing the placement/location of user data and programs.Update - OK curiosity got the better of me and I had a peak under the covers. (see photo)My limited knowledge of battery informational details indicates to me that the battery was made in 2014, which may explain why in 2017 I have lost 10.6% of the battery on the day I purchased the ASUS E200HA(AUG-2017), my Chinese/Japanese readings skills are nil, so I could be wrong.The build date for the laptop is indicated as MAY-2017 and also confirmed with Windows 10 OS burn date.Also noted, there is no chance to upgrade to a 2x2 WiFi card as there is only one antenna cable provided. Doh!! :-)But the WiFi is still OK at 250Mbits/sec real speed, so it's no biggie and saves power for....the CPU/GPU
I was a little nervous ordering this laptop for school (college) but once I received it and spent some time with it I have come to really like it. So, to help you make up your mind:Pros-I love the compact size and light weight. It adds no mass to my already heavy backpack.The screen quality is surprisingly good. I was reading reviews about crappy screen quality, so imagine my shock when I open the screen and it's like looking at a mini hdtv. It has a bit of that gameboy color effect, but all laptops do.This little thing is really speedy. As another user suggested, I installed ghostey(sp?) And another program to help internet security/speed and I can have 2 browsers open with tons of tabs and it can handle it's own.It can run Minecraft. I was not expecting that, but it was a very pleasant surprise.The color is really pretty. It's not a bold gold. When I took it out of the box I thought they had sent me a silver one. Once my eyes adjusted I noticed it was a very pretty light gold. Almost rose gold.It has a microSD port, so you're not limited to the Gigs it comes with.Cons-I don't know if it's Windows 10 (this is my first time with windows 10) or the laptop, but updates take a long while. So much so that the first time I thought it was broken.Due to the aforementioned situation I had to get in contact with the online ASUS customer service. I was not impressed.I miss a full sized keyboard with the numbers pad, but I don't think newer laptops use them anyways? So it's not a huge loss.All in all, I really like this little guy. Hopefully that helps you decide whether or not you want to buy it.
I just received this, and will return to update review as I learn more. I've loaded Windows 10 Pro, which I very much wanted and consider a positive feature, but now of the 64 G rated storage, only 16 G is now showing as left to use. And I have put no programs or files at all on the computer. as yet. I will probably just put more memory in on an SD card, but it's surprising to me that there's so little storage available.But: $199 2.2 lb computer for travelling with to places where it might end up taken? What a bargain. I'm used to higher end computers, but may turn out to be perfectly happy with this, so long as it can actually DO what I need it to do. Some word processing, run the browser, emails, store a few photos. The computer looks perfectly nice, keyboard feels good for the little I've used it, touch pad has a slightly rickety quality.Once I've actually used it, will report on speed, screen, sound, etc.
Small, compact, beautiful color, quality materials for the exterior. It's just like my bigger asus. If you like asus you'll love this computer. It's got everything. At first I had a little trouble with the web browsing (maybe it was my internet) but it works great now. Great alternative if you want all the looks of a MacBook Air but not the price. Plus, it's got windows! How much better can it get. Now I can take a light and efficient (cause the battery is WOW) laptop to class with me. Great for turning in assignments and printing on the go!Update--- removed a star because it sometimes shuts off for no reason and you have to hold down the power button for legitimately 20 seconds for it to turn on again. I have mini heart attacks every time this happens.
I am a dyed-in-the-wool Apple Mac fanatic.Now that being said, I have a necessary program that only runs on Windows and I didn't want to partition my MacBook.I was looking for a light laptop, without Windows 8, booted up quickly, and didn't cost too much.This laptop fit the bill and then some.It is LIGHTER than my MacBook Air (!), runs Windows 10, boots up from power off (not sleep) in an amazing 16 seconds, and was under $200.(Nice Champagne like color too)I love it!
Came in right on time, packaged in a nice slim case that could double as a carrying case. Ultra light weight and booted right into set up. Battery has been working for over 4 hours off a full charge and continuous use. For a $200 computer I would recommend this to anyone wanting something to use on the move, or as a travel companion. Also to a elderly person looking for something simple to use. Built in speakers are plenty loud, screen is crisp and clear, and the keyboard is a compact layout without the 10 key on the right side. The keyboard is nicely centered and the mousepad is positioned where I won't accidentally click while typing. The only issue I could see anyone having is the processing speed, and if you are looking for a fast processor in this price bracket, you won't find it, so reevaluate what you want/need.
I was searching for a small computer to run Windows as all other computers I have are Mads. From price perspective I was consideringByte Plus (Fanless Windows 10 Mini Desktop PC - Intel CherryTrail T3 Z8300 Quad-Core, 1.44 GHz (up to 1.84 GHz) 4GB RAM+32GB storage). Then I find that ASUS E200HA Portable Lightweight 11.6-inch Intel Quad-Core Laptop, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage may be a better choice since is a full notebook, light and portable. My concerns were about ability to run MS Office application on a Windows 10 platform, flash storage limitations and graphic performance becauseI will use this machine mostly in a desktop configuration using a LG wide format monitor 2560X1080. Well, when arrived, the machine was nice and small. I goth through the pains of installing MS Office at a very slow pace. Then, with Windows 10, MS Office and all other software that the machine came with I got very much to the end of the flash drive space at about 28Gb out of 32 Gb total. It was s solution for that as I tried option to compress the drive in the setting. Voila, Local Disk (C:) shows 12.6 Gb free of 28.3 Gb. Everything works flawlessly, I am so impressed and amazed with the capabilities of a $200 laptop that can do so much for so little price. Of course, other people may find limitations, however, it is a perfect choice for my special purpose of running MS Office mostly in the office with a large monitor and use it as a notebook occasionally when on the road. I highly recommend it to anyone that need a cheap, portable Windows 10 machine.ASUS E200HA Portable Lightweight 11.6-inch Intel Quad-Core Laptop, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage, Windows 10 with 1 Year Microsoft Office 365 Subscription
I purchased this laptop for my wife, who was looking primarily for an internet machine with maybe some light Office use. She also wanted something small, so the 11.6" size fit the bill.I have been working with computers since the early 90s (both PC and Apple), so I know my way around a machine.Build Quality: For the price, I can't really complain. It looks sharp, and the overall quality of materials used seems to be great. The keyboard feels pretty good, and the trackpad works great. I'm a huge Macbook fan, and the gestures for scrolling on the Asus trackpad are very nice.Performance: The 4gigs of memory along with the CPU makes Windows 10 move very smoothly. Day-to-day use of Chrome and other apps works great. Everything is quick to load. The wireless card never loses connectivity, and it zips around the internet just fine.Small HD: It should not be a surprise to anyone that orders this that it only comes with a 32 gig drive. Yes that is small, but it's not a big deal if you aren't installing tons of apps or saving lots of media. Many people complain that after Windows 10 updates, they have no room left. I found that I had less than 2 gigs free after all updates. HOWEVER... you need to run disk cleanup. Win 10 leaves a lot of update files laying around. After you delete this junk, I was up to 12 gigs free. 12 gigs free is plenty for my wife, and she can always utilize an online service to store more or pop in a micro SD card.Display: We've tried Netflix and some HD movie trailers on Youtube so far. They look great to us. There are no issues with the laptop keeping up with the video, and the little 11.6 display has a nice look to it with HD material. We aren't talking 4k quality here, but it's better than expected for the size and price.Overall, this laptop is great. The price is great, and I've enjoyed using ASUS products for years with no issues (mostly motherboards).You won't regret this purchase. Just make sure you do some basic maintenance on it to tweak its performance and storage.
Sigh..where do I start? This laptop has been an utter disappointment. First, it didn't come with the year-long subscription to office 365. Then I wasn't able to download any apps because of a file error. On top of that it is extremely slow and not at all user friendly. Just today I turned it on and it kept going for more than 20 minutes "working on updates." I realize it is very cheap and you get what you pay for but I didn't pay for something to require an essential file error fix in order for it to work. I am not a heavy-duty laptop user. I only do light browsing and basic word processing. I don't need all the bells and whistles so this should have fit the bill but it didn't even come close.For comparison, I bought an Acer chromebook at around the same price point a few years back and even after being used extensively and banged around a bit it is still going strong and it is still fast.I will never buy another ASUS again. This laptop is a disgrace and Amazon should not sell it or should at least offer a refund with no restocking fee.
The laptop have a great build, the windows version is limited exactly as the office that brings. The wifi card sometimes gets crazy and swicths off, to solve this you need to disable the battery saving option. Essenciallly i buy this laptop to install ElementaryOS and so far was a great experience, some people said there's no option for Hardrive but my version have the space to add one and it works, in fact you can run that disk first in boot and even run a OS there.
Alright so I purchased the 11.6" not the 14" and everything was exactly as described in the product description. I had carefully read through the reviews prior to making my purchase and have come to several conclusions. This is a great system at it's purchase price. I had decided to switch over to Windows10 Pro before receiving my product. Was pleasantly surprised how simple the process was and how quickly my new PC was up and running. The system comes with 64 GB of memory so I had also ordered a 128 GB micro SD to cover my storage needs. I am finding that half the reviews are pretty clearly folks that haven't bothered actually reading the tech specs for what they were purchasing. Very crisp images from this bitty screen, had the computer running for 5 hours and is still cool to the touch. Ran a couple low end games (visual novels and Civ3) on the system with no issues. A complaint I normally have with my laptops is the volume without headphones being inadequate for streaming television and I do not have that issue with this system.Only thing I've noticed is I have to pull and replug the headphones when starting a new episode or game. This may be an issue with my headphones though shrug.
I ordered this for work and needed it immediately on the delivery day. It would not function beyond the system setup selection screen. Stuck in a constant boot loop. Asus has a 48 hour wait for customer service to contact you. I'm not sure if it's a problem with Asus or windows. Either way I'm very disappointed with the situation. Now I have to return this and find another laptop for tomorrow. The only good thing about this is Amazon customer service. They're the best.
Editing review after 2 mos of use. This computer is both the best and worst and it is hard to really be fair since you can't get a windows computer with office for a better price. That said, it is close to impossible to use other than for watching a video. Surfing the net is next to impossible as the screen constantly resizes, the cursur will not stay where you put it--it jumps all over the place and I am constantly clicking on things I didn't intend or deleting things I didn't intend. Can't scroll with 1 hand as you need 2 hands to try and keep cursor where you want it. Impossible to do work on it other than perhaps basic typing. The small keyboard is really hard to get used to and I never did. So,it is good to have as a backup computer, if you need MS Office, but can't recommend for anyone to use for work or school.Unbelievably lightweight!Very small--like a mini laptopNo backlight keyboardSets up fast.No touchscreen!--the description says there it has one but this is an error and should be removed!Horrible track/mouse.Not a lot of memory. I have office, outlook mail, norton, 3 onedrive folders and chrome browser installed and that takes up all of the memory. No room for most of my onedrive folders or any photos or icloud or any other software programs.Keyboard takes a long time to get used to and I am constantly deleting things by mistake, including writing this review which deleted text while typing for unknown reason.The mouse trackpad is pretty bad and cursor does not stay where you put it and the screen size is constantly changing even though I haven't clicked on resize.If you copy and paste a lot or use the right click a lot, you will be very frustrated and it often takes me 5 tries to select something as the mouse doesn't stay where you put it but jumps around a lot so you think you are clicking on one thing but the mouse clicks on something else. Could be very problematic if you delete something by mistake.Bottom line, for the money, it is a good computer (so far). It has windows and office which is great for such a small machine. Watching videos is fine, surfing the web is fine but I would not use this for work or school or anything that involves a lot of typing and cutting and pasting or right clicks. Since the keyboard isn't backlit, you won't really be able to use it at night, so keep that in mind.I bought it for travel as it is so lightweight and as a backup in an emergency for my main laptop as I seem to go through laptops about every 2 years.
So for starters I ordered a warranty with this right. Well one day I come home (I live by myself so I know no one has been there) and I go to turn on my laptop. Well it was dead so I try to charge it and it didn't so I buy a new charger. Well that didn't work either so after many attempts I realized the charging port stopped working (Idk how) but I call support to see if Asus would replace it or fix it and I got some of the worst customer service and he kept saying I probably threw my laptop and that I shouldn't be cheap and just buy a new one. (And this was 5 days after the laptop arriving and the warranty was 3 months) if this is their type of employees and how they treat customers and how there products function then I'm never gonna buy ASUS again
I purchased an Asus C300 Chromebook a couple years ago, but I needed something with Windows to write Powershell code on and connect to my company's VPN with a smart card. I also wanted something small to travel with that wasn't too expensive in case it was stolen/damaged.Here are my criticisms so far:-System came with an older version of Windows 10. It took about 5 hours to update to the latest version.-Compared to the C300, this laptop's power cord cable seems a little thinner. I'll have to make sure I'm not putting too much wear and tear on it.-11.6 inch screen is nice, but small. The keyboard keys are on the smaller side. For extended desk use, I would hook up to a keyboard/mouse/larger screen.-Disk is very small. I managed to free up 14GB of the 28GB available. Do the following to free up more space:*after the major update is complete, go to C drive and use Disk cleanup utility.*if you are exclusively going to be using google apps in the browser, remove the Office trial install to save a little extra space.Pros:-lightweight and portable-screen looks pretty good!-trackpad works pretty well-once the updates are done, laptop works pretty quickly
We bought this to replace our 5 year old Dell that was starting to have connection issues. We really only needed a "family" computer to surf the internet and transfer pictures from our cameras/phones onto an external hard drive. For this purpose, the computer works great. It's fast enough with the 4GB of RAM to transfer the photos & videos via USB 3.0 without taking a lot of time. It's small enough that we just keep it on our kitchen counter so we can have access to it whenever we want. I also like that it has bluetooth pre-installed, that way we can use a bluetooth mouse without needing to use one of the USB ports for a wireless dongle. It leaves one of the USB ports free for a flash drive. The only thing I wish it did have was a full size SD card reader. It comes with a micro SD card reader, but our DSLR cameras have full size SD Cards, so we need to buy new micro SD cards with an adapter for our cameras, or a USB / SD Card adapter for the computer. We chose the second route since the adapter is cheaper than buying new micro SD cards. It's not a big deal, but I took off one star for it.
This is Day 2 and everything is great to me so far. I'm giving this 4 star just because I am struggling with increasing storage by mounting VHD. But once it's done, I am pretty sure I can give 5. Just like those who still eyeball and half-decided to buy this I was also suspisious that how good this tiny laptop can do. If you are not heavy user, i.e., use computers only for browsing, emailing, creating documents, watching video clips, this computer is right fit for you.Capability:I believe this computer is amazing for this price. Well I should remind you that I am not techie and I was looking for a new computer that can replace old one. And as soon as I got this mini laptop, I did a bit of experiment: runinng the two computers at my home. The older one has i5 3rd generation and this E200HA has Atom. First thing I did was that I played video on Youtube for the two laptops and the processing speed looks almost same to me. I also did for browsing, email, document, and all the regular stuff and I think netbook is highly capable. I don't write a code or do video editing and I can imagine doing these thing will require a lot more power and this loptop might not a good fit for that kinds of use. So those who gave 1 star or low rating on this computer did not look at the specs carefully.For battery life, the description says it can last more than 10 hours. It is kind of true, but it is highly depending on how you use the laptop. For example, simple browsing and creating documents can save battery and doesn't cosume much power so 10+hours is possible. However, if you watch Youtube video or listen to music a lot, the battery life can be more or less 6 hours. It is the nature of battery of course, I believe it is still great though.This laptop comes with Office 365 for 1 Year. This is great but those who use laptop for business use, you might want to purchase Office Suite by yourself. After the 1 year, your free-subscription will expire and if you want to use the same software you have to pay. So if you are heavy Word or Excel user, consider buying entire suite then you don't have to worry about expiration.Speaking of internal cam, don't expect much. When I turned it on, I was like someone put mosaic on my face saying SENSORED! The camera resolution is that blur and rough. If you skype on a regualr basis, I would suggest to replace with something else.I carried this around a bit of time, with laptop cover wrapped. Feels like I didn't hold anything and forgot that I was having on my hand and almomst dropped it. It is that ligthweight. Funny enough I was also looking at 15.6" laptops and they were cheaper than other smaller laptops but most of them come with a lot of weight.Oh yes, I almost forgot to tell you that the sleep mode is amazing! Compared to my old one, this baby wakes up real fast from sleep (I would say 2 seconds) and I can use touchpad gestures with no problem (this was a big issue on my old guy and I sometimes had to restart it). Just like many computers, it takes a bit of time to get back to normal speed after sleep mode, but other than that this is great.Exteriors:The cosmetic color looks like a bit feminine on the screen, but the real one is more like champagne gold and not too shiny. The keyboard looks ok, but it doesn't come with backlit. This might also sound odd to you because when I first opened up the laptop, no simbol or icon on f3 and f4 keys, which is up and down button for backlit. Even though the Amazon description says that it is full-size keyboard, for 11" laptop, some people might feel each key is small, especially those who have big hands. But I am pretty sure you will get used to the size.Minor thing: Caps Lock doesn't have a light so you might not notice when it is on or off. And also this is very my personal preference that I would love to have earphone jack on the left, rather than on right side. I have no idea ASUS placed charger jack on the left but not earphone jack? If you are southpaw, you can take a note while listening to music.Overall, this baby is great! But remind you that only relative to the price. You might not get a computer with the same spec or capability for twice much cost. If you want a powerful one that allows you to make movie, this is not for you. Those of you who want to have a portable, long-battery life, basic laptop, this is the one for you.
This little laptop is pretty darn good for the price.Was surprised by the performance, good deal.
This little computer was purchased for a single task, to run a tuning program for cars. It is all it has ever done...it's been on the internet one time to research tuning information on a secure forum. With less than two hours of operating time, it is stuck in "checking for updates 100% complete, don't turn off your computer" and has been for hours...it will not force shutdown, exit, nothing but this screen..period...I realize it's not a top of the line computer...but it should continue to work with basic functions.
ASUS E200HA Portable Lightweight 11.6-inch Intel Quad-Core Laptop, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage, Windows 10 with 1 Year Microsoft Office 365 SubscriptionÂ Great little portable laptop. Perfect for media consumption. It is pretty snappy for the cpu and the battery lasts a long time. Build quality seems to be top notch. For the money you cant go wrong. Overall a great product.
Mousepad is a PITA to work with. Touch screen is cool. If I'd known about all the mousepad sensitivity issues, sometimes too sensitive, and sometimes not working at all, I would have looked for a different computer.UPDATE: THIS COMPUTER IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GOOGLE CHROME! The tabs don't have speakers on them to tell you which tabs are playing the music and if you have a lot of tabs open, the X is right in the middle of it. DON'T BUY!UPDATE 2: Just found another problem in Opera. DON'T BUY! I'm a computer programmer and T.I. specialist. I would know.UPDATE 3: Vivaldi Browser won't import bookmarks and settings from Google Chrome. It keeps saying that Chrome is still open, even though I rebooted and everything. Google search for symtpoms and solution returns open zero results.Consider yourself warned!
I actully loved it until it decided to not turn on one day. I had to put in a SD card in order to do windows updates, even before loading any other software. Moving things onto the SD card to free up space seemed to make the computer run better. It would occasionally run a little slow when I had multiple PDFs and web browsers open; in general it ran fine for day to day tasks. I would like to buy another one to see if it was just a fluke that it wouldn't turn on, but they are too popular!Amazon was great and let me return in 1 month after purchase since it died.
This is a great laptop for on the go emergencies and presentations. I'm an IT guy, so it's fine for Remote Desktop uses and web browsing. You can also use it for media consumption watching YouTube and Netflix, or any downloaded videos in general. Be warned though, if you need to run serious apps like Office and Project, it would work but the result would be painfully slow. Some JavaScript heavy websites like outlook can also bog it down. It'll come to a crawl if there's a background update going on at the same time. Don't get me wrong, you can actually do almost everything except gaming if you are patient enough and don't mind some slowdowns here and there, and careful with what you run at the same time. If you download a lot of stuff, you'd need to get a minimum of 200GB microSD card. With 64GB of internal storage, I have the OS 10 Pro upgrade, Office Suite, 3 main internet browsers, SQL Management Studio, and I have about half left, not leaving much room for big video files.
I purchased the 14" Quad Core E2-6110 32GB L402W Model for $199. I needed a decent cheap work laptop and decided to purchase this. The unit comes with Windows 10 S pre-installed. The upgrade process is relatively easy and quick to Windows 10 Pro (which is available through the windows store). The OS update process afterwards is not so. After updating finally finished, the laptop preforms perfectly fine. Its really quite responsive, however by no means is it "fast". The built in eMMC 32GB drive will have about 9.8GB left after Windows upgrade/updates and Office install.Have not figured out how to redeem the Office subscription, but I have Office 365 Personal anyways, so that didnt matter to me. You may want to find out how, though.Located on the bottom of the unit is actually a 2.5 bay for adding a second hard drive. Please be aware that its designed for a slim type drive. A standard 2.5 in drive will NOT fit. You'll end up bending the SATA controller on the motherboard up if you try to shove it in there. The SD card reader on the side is also a small gripe. The SD card does NOT push in all the way. It sticks out about 3/4" from the laptop. Was kind of disappointed with this but the 2.5 bay kinda makes up for it.I opened the bottom of the laptop to see if there may also be an additional RAM slot, which I did not find from just popping off the bottom cover. IF there is one, it could be on the other side. Windows states theres 1 of 2 slots being used but it could be wrong.The CPU heatsink, for some reason (at least with mine), has a bit of Thermal Paste on top of it, which then touches the bottom cover of the laptop. This causes that spot to get rather uncomfortably warm.All in all, its a perfectly decent laptop for basic functions. Would look into cloud storage as the 32GB model leaves little to no room, although documents would be fine to save to it.
Well first off let me start by saying you're getting $200 worth of computer, so keep that in mind. I bought this as a cheap replacement because my Mac (2011) finally bit the dust and I didn't wanna spend an outrageous amount on a laptop just yet. It works just as expected. I mainly use it for writing and browsing. It runs photoshop pretty well (mind you, you'll need to have photoshop on a flash drive because the computer itself doesn't have much room to hold it) my only complaint is that it does run a little slow. I first thought it was my internet, but after going around and using others wifi I noticed it was just an all over thing for this computer. It's a nice little computer if all you're looking for is browsing and writing.
Unfortunately, during the first day's use the laptop failed to power on any more. The power supply is still providing the correct power to the laptop because I measured it but since you can't troubleshoot any further without taking the laptop apart I just returned it. It's a shame because it was perfect for taking to and from college classes but this appears to happen to quite a few folks that have purchased ASUS VivoBook E203NA. It was $199 when I picked it up.
I'm in love with this little guy. It's really not gold, its a champagne color, which I really like (I hate gold colored anything so this made my day). I am giving this 4 stars because it had to do the Windows 10 update, and for some reason it took hours (most of the day). I'm not sure if I did something on my end for it to take so long, or if this is just how long it takes? It's super light, which I will love for when I am in school. I think the keyboard is nice, I know others have commented that its too small or it took them awhile to adapt.. I use a MacBook for work, and I really had no problem. I will likely update down the road once I actually start using it.***Update 12Sep2017***Still works well, but seems to have slowed down quite a bit. I downloaded a couple of Chrome extensions like someone had mentioned on here and it did speed it up a little. I wouldn't say that I am still in "love" with this computer, I am in "like" with it. I am currently taking EMT classes as well as a math class (both are for college) and it keeps up. It just gets a little frustrating at times.
I love this laptop! I have had it for 8 months and no problems.It's perfect for a college student to just do school stuff on. Papers, projects, presentations! This has helped me through graduate schoolAnd you cannot beat the price!I have not had any problems with this computer. As long as you dont open too many windows on your internet browser, the internet connection is fine. It is also great to travel with!Pros:-It is lightweight-battery life is great-perfect for a college student-priceCons:-the keyboard feels a bit weird but once i bought a keyboard cover, it was great.I don't have a lot of cons with this laptop and it has been serving its purpose wonderfully :DIf you just want a laptop for school, office work, traveling or just simple tasks then this laptop is for you
I love this tiny little laptop! Sometimes when it gets too hot the screen turns black when you move the mouse cursor. Not sure how to fix that and I googled to no end and couldnât find it. I just keep it cool and donât use it heavily while it is charging. The battery lasts a whole day of graduate school filled with writing reports and watching therapy. The keyboard takes a minute to get used to if youâre transitioning from a larger laptop but once you adjust it isnât a problem. This laptop is perfect for someone who doesnât want to lug around a huge piece of technology and does not need a lot of space on their laptop. I use one drive provided by my school to accommodate for the small storage size of the laptop.
Okay, It took me about three weeks to make my mind up! I really am happy that I choose to get this laptop. I received it very fast!!! In fact I got it today and I just updated it. It looks sexy! The keyboard takes a bit to get use to, but so far, it is very good....Now, I am not using it for gaming or anything. I just using it for browsing, e-mailing, writing essays for school etc.. So far, I am impressed with the multitasking. I currently have three tabs open and it is working very well. The typing was laggy during the update on the window's OS. Now the lag has went away and Everything has been amazing. I even downloaded two programs at the same time and they went by fast. I was impressed!!If you are looking for a good simple laptop to do browsing, e-mails, homework and simple research!! It is probably a great little laptop thus far!If I run into any issues, I will surely update this review. Thank you guys !! And thank you Amazon for being so AMAZING!!!!!!
MY REASONS FOR BUYING: I purchased this laptop for homework (I am a college student) as well as watch movies using an external drive to when I am traveling. I am not a fan of tablets because I prefer typing my papers on a keyboard and Windows Operating System works well for me.FIRST IMPRESSIONS: When I first unboxed the laptop, it was as small as I had expected. As compact as the package was, the keyboard is still easy to type on, the buttons don't depress far at all and it has that classic laptop keyboard feel. I did find, that when typing, I turn of the touchpad because my resting hands seems to move the mouse and will mess me up (easy fix). The touchpad is responsive, and the left and right clicking is easy to operate and haven't had to fight it very much like some other touch pads.CONTINUED USE: I have been happy with the duration of battery life, even when watching movies and typing papers, I can use this laptop for most of the day before having to charge again. It does not heat up significantly like other laptops that I have had (I am assuming because of the size) and it is a very quiet system. I have typed about 15 multi-page essays on this laptop and my hands have yet to cramp up, so I'd say they did a great job with the design with the little space that they had to work with.OVERALL: I would highly recommend this laptop if you are looking for a mobile work station, or something to view multimedia on during the day. The small display makes it difficult to replace a larger computer or laptop, but if you are like myself and would rather avoid a pricey tablet, I recommend this for you. When I bought this, it also came with a year-long subscription to Microsoft office, which is an absolute treat and is the cherry on top of this machine.
this is my first laptop perches and its a great starter laptops but windows app store is lacking a lot but its good for just the basics things you need to get done graphic are just okay not outstanding and the speaker a barley noticeable which means you will need another option for sound out put like a Bluetooth speaker or desktop speaker but the small sixe means it portable or and lightweight and it not to bid or to small the perfect in-between size the font is really tiny so you'll haft to adjust that to your liking other then that the build is durable and the keys are great and not flimsy but the keys are not back lit so you'll need light unless you have great eyes and can see in the dark the track pad could be a bit confusing but you'll get use to it nut I will be buying another one soon a chrome book that will be 13 inch and only because I think google is just what I'm used to
I like these low cost laptops. They make it so everyone can have one or two to use in different placed with different use cases and requrements. Only a few days in but pretty good so far. Its small, so don't be surprised by that. The screen portion is a bit flexible so we shall see how durable it is. The battery life is good and rather responsive for what it is. The keyboard is reasonable to use with fair typing feel. Its light to carry around and small enough to fit. The exterior finish is very shiny and quite reflective. As has been noted it picks up fingertips and if placed in direct sunlight it will reflect enough to be uncomfortable to look at.
I hate Windows 10 but I think this one you can change it to Windows 7 or 8; but I'm not sure yet because I haven't had the time to check and do that. This is a great looking laptop, great quality, and it's pretty light. Everything is great about this laptop except the speed. It's on the slow side. I got this when the price went down so I paid just under $200 bucks for this. It's worth it because main reason I bought this is because I have mobile WiFi and sometimes I need to take a 'smaller' laptop on the go.Smaller laptops like does not affect they keyboard size at all. It just eliminates all that extra space on the sides of the laptop that you really don't need. Totally great for on the go, and sometimes small enough to slip into your handbag if bag is big enough. Very nice laptop.
was 1/4 the cost of a fancier ASUS that failed completely on startup. This one was 1/4 the hassle. Very thin and easy to pack, easy to set up.I'm 70, about 5/3", and I still very much enjoy travel but don't need or want a heavier or bulkier laptop. This one fits easily into a large purse and seems ideal. Set up was very simple with "Cortona" being the ASUS interactive feature (compare to Siri on I Phone and Alexa on Amazon Fire.)Came loaded with 1 year of Microsoft Office and Window 10.For only $199 I'm hooked!
A great, portable computer for college. I love bringing this to class because it is light and doesn't take up a lot of desk space. My favorite feature is that it runs Windows 10, unlike the Chromebooks that are out there for the same price. It does have only 32 GB of storage space on the hard drive, but you can easily add more space with an SSD card.This computer also runs low level games pretty well. I have played Hearthstone on it with low graphics with no problem and other small games (Hotline Miami 2, Epistory:Typing Chronicles, Undertale) with little or no problems.Overall, this computer is a great budget friendly computer for college and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a computer for college or school.
I was using my school/work computer (which is rather large) as my personal computer and decided that I needed a separate PC for personal use which is why I purchased the ASUS E200HA. I'm using the ASUS for typing manuscripts, email, and general web browsing at home or at coffee shops. I'm a grad student (computational geneticist) so I do an excessive amount of typing, literature browsing, and emailing and this little ASUS works perfectly for those tasks. I purchased a separate 32Gb micro SD card to store literature and papers and so far so good. I will add that this computer was a warehouse deal and was purchased as "very good" condition and the item arrived with only one tiny little nick that is hardly noticeable. The previous owner must have updated to Windows 10 because startup was less than 10 minutes, with about 5 minutes of updates. I had to install the touchpad gesture features on the computer because they were missing, but installation took less than 5 minutes. Microsoft Office did not come installed, nor could I redeem the free 1-year trial, but I got the software for free through my University so it didn't concern me. I read reviews stating that updating to Windows 10 used up most of their computer's storage, but my computer arrived with about 16Gb of free storage. The issue after a recent Windows update is that the previous Windows files are kept as backup, but are automatically deleted in about a month. You can manually delete these files if you want which will free up a lot of space.Pros:Extremely lightweight and can carry around in one hand easily. I travel a lot to conferences and meetings and I'm definitely looking forward to not having to lug my heavy work laptop.Battery life lasts more than 6 hours. I never use it more than 4-5 hours at a time without charging so I don't know how long it actually lasts, but it indicates 11+ hours of charge time.Surprisingly responsive and snappy. I've read negative reviews about it crashing and bogging down, but that isn't the case with mine. I have Chrome installed, which is a ram hog, but the pages load quickly and YouTube videos stream without any lag.Very sleek and nice design! It actually looks like it costs twice as much!Screen is good and fair. It does have bad viewing angles, but its not a deal breaker if you don't mind adjusting the lid.Cons:The keyboard is a little bit spongy and doesn't rebound as fast, but you can type decently by pressing a little harder. The keys are also small and spaced out which looks cool but a tad unnecessary given the lack of space.The touchpad is not always consistent and the soft clicking response works best in certain areas. The hard clicking is easiest towards the bottom of the touchpad, and not so much near the top. You may want to invest in a good mouse.BIG CON is the two nubs that stick out behind the lid. You cant open the lid while the computer is resting on a flat surface without the nubs digging at the surface. The computer doesn't rest on all four rubber feet when the lid is open, instead it rests on the front two feet and the two lid nubs (or whatever you want to call them) -- really annoying.Overall great little laptop that is perfect for college students who do not need a computer for heavy processing like excel, video and photo editing, or gaming. Perfect for web browsing, video streaming, Microsoft Word, or as a second device for travel. Would recommend!
This is a very lightweight notebook computer, running Windows 10, at a very, very good price. Only two problems. Although I really like having a solid state drive for quick startup, the size of 32 gigs is limiting. With a few basic programs and a greatly reduced dropbox size, there's no working room for Windows updates, even with a 1 TB external drive temporarily connected. I'd have to remove my dropbox files to allow an update, and it just gets to be too much trouble. I'm finding out, though, that I can get along just fine with the installed version of Windows 10, so I'm giving up on big updates. Two, I have some concern about the on-off process. There have been a few occasions when the computer shut off (I usually leave it on at home, but when traveling I shut it down) and was very difficult to turn back on. I suspect a mechanical weakness in the switch, because the last time it happened I removed the back and poked around, then put it back on and it started up. Perhaps it sometimes needs a gentle nudge to get it fired up.
Had this copmuterNeeded this for work as I tend to be away from the office a lot. Runs Word and Open Office perfect. Solidly built, I don't feel like I'm going to break it when I use it or carry it. It does everything I need it to. I can also have two web browsers open with multiple tabs on each including having Facebook and YouTube open, and the computer handles it all fine. I have no regrets with this purchase.
Not bad for the money, but companies need to install bigger drives if they expect people to use Windows 10. The OS takes up approximately 20 GB on the flash storage. Companies say they have no control whether or not their machines work well with Windows, which they are designed to do! They seem to pass the buck to Microsoft, saying they have no control over how much space an operating system takes up. I know the trend is to make Windows hardware that is lightweight, but 64 GB should be the bare minimum of installed storage. This approach only works on chrome books. Had to return the laptop.
This is awesome. I have a 17" laptop and it's heavy and hot to sit on your lap when in bed. I have a Samsung tablet, but it's heavy too when you have to hold onto it. I have hand issues. So I saw this and reading reviews figured it would serve my purpose....mainly that of reading digital books and looking around the net. This actually weighs less than my tablet and it will last a good 6+ hours on battery. The only thing I would love more was if it was Windows XP.....lol Made my decision after reading all the reviews here. Thanks everyone for sharing their thoughts on this ASUS.
Well, loved initially the look, size, and functionality. Just needed a very lightweight basic laptop for my daughter to take to school so that it wouldn't weigh her down. Unfortunately at just week # 10, several keys on the right side of the keyboard no longer work. Did my own troubleshooting and confirmed with ASUS online chat support that this is a hardware problem So this completely new product didn't even last 3 months before needing to send it in for repair. Enough said...
The laptop that I'm reviewing is the E200HA 11.6" light gold-colored model with 4GB RAM and 32GB storage.(Reviewed on 2/19/2018, Purchased on 5/9/2017)In short, it is a decent laptop that comes standard with Windows 10 and can do basic computing tasks, such as document processing and social media browsing.Here are some of the specific details of the laptop if you're interested:Windows 10 Home 64-bit Operating SystemIntel Atom x5-Z8350 x64-based Quad-core @ 1.44GHz with a max burst frequency up to 1.92 GHz4GB DDR3Intel HD Graphics 400 (integrated chipset)32GB Integrated SSD1366 x 768 max resolutionBluetooth 4.0The laptop's size makes it portable enough to fit inside my backpack's tablet pocket, and its weight is light so I don't have to experience back or shoulder pain. There are two USB 2.0 ports, a microSD card reader, a mini HDMI adapter port, and a 3.5mm headphone port. The trackpad is located in the middle of the laptop so you don't have to deal with strange offset trackpads like other laptops possess. It also comes with Bluetooth so you can connect certain devices, such as wireless headphones or your smartphone.I'm someone who is 5'6", slightly overweight, and has slightly larger hands, so the keys are a little small compared to, say, an average-sized MacBook. The function keys are about half in size than the regularly sized keys, but the spacebar is reasonably-sized enough without hitting another key.In terms of performance, the laptop is sufficient enough to load web pages in a timely manner. I use Firefox because of its light RAM usage compared to Chrome. YouTube videos will play without crashing the computer, but do take note that if you're watching a 60 FPS video at 720p, you might experience some slowdown. For safe measure, I'd stick with 480p. High resolution 60FPS YouTube videos are absolute resource hogs, especially on Chrome.I don't use Microsoft Office on this laptop, so I resort to using Google Drive. It's performance is sub-par, as it takes more than a few seconds to completely load a document, depending on its contents. If it's a page, it might take a few seconds. If it's a long research paper, it might take longer than a few seconds or so. The same can be said for slides and spreadsheets.The battery life (according to mine after over a year of usage) can reach up to 11 hours with the brightness set at 75% without any running programs. If you're using Chrome or Firefox with a few tabs open and background apps, you might be able to squeeze out, at most, 8 hours, which is enough to go about my day as a college student.With the computer's specifications, do not buy this laptop expecting that you can play GTA5 or Overwatch. This is not, by any means, a gaming laptop. If you want to play video games on a laptop like this, you're better suited for very low-end games, such as Old-School RuneScape, Minecraft, Classic Doom series, or any old-school games from GOG. I haven't tested many games, primarily because of the storage limitations. The specs are faster than what was in the 90's, but it doesn't even compare to a high-end PC with an 8th-gen i7 and a GTX 10-series card, let alone the cheapest MacBook from Apple right now. You can run Rainmeter in the background and it won't burn out your laptop but try to animate a first-person rig for an FPS game and it'll most likely crash.The storage is my biggest problem with this laptop as of right now. Windows 10 requires at least 12 GB to function properly, so you absolutely cannot delete any of those files. Next, if you purchased this laptop straight from ASUS, you can expect there to be some bloatware (or useless programs installed by the manufacturer). That is already an additional, say, 1 or 2 GB. If you decide to install Microsoft Office, that takes up an additional 3 or 4 GB. So, by the end of all that, you're left with at least 10 GB of storage, if not less. It seems like enough for basic tasks, but don't expect to carry all of your favorite television series or videos you want to watch later. It's enough to store a ton of images, but definitely not movies or full TV series at a high resolution. Unfortunately, Windows updates will also use that storage, and depending on the update, it could be costly. I'd carry an additional flash drive or even an external drive if you're going to carry around tons of important data.All in all, I paid $240 for this laptop which, honestly, was a bit much considering its original price ($40 more than the MSRP). However, if you're on a super-tight budget and require a cheap laptop for basic tasks, I can say the little 11-inch computer can do what you need to do. If you're not sure on what to buy for a laptop but have no budget limits, I'd buy a MacBook. If you don't want to purchase a MacBook, I'd take the time to research into Windows 10 laptops and figure out what's best for what you want.I mean, hey if you want to look rich, the laptop looks like a MacBook if you buy the light gold-colored model.
Whatever you do.. Do not buy this product... Have had this laptop since September (so 4 months) and have already had it replaced and it is now no longer working... And the company won't replace or refund!!
On the recent recommendation of Consumer Reports, I bought one of these for travel. For $22 I added a 64Gb MicroSD card https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B010Q588D4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00, and thanks to my buddy's brilliant suggestion, I ordered this https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JUHDYSO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 bluetooth mouse.I've used it now for several months, with a month in the Bahamas where it was my primary computer. I do a lot of typing, so something like this (no touchscreen) makes more sense for me than a big pad, and the price is sure right at $200. There is about 10-11 Gb of space left for programs, so you will need an SD chip if you plan to put much of anything on this computer. And each time Windows does any major updates, you will need to delete the files for the previous version (easily done by adding this as a category to the disc cleanup app). I found this out when I got a message that I was getting low on disc space. Deleting these files took me from 3 to 10 Gb of disc space.Because of the electronic drive, the speed seems very similar to my old Dell 32-Bit desktop, which admittedly is not real fast. But it's way faster than my iPad mini. The touch pad is actually pretty good, and the keyboard is surprisingly good. It's just got a very good feel - just the right amount of resistance and feedback.Run time is about 10 hours. Besides the MicroSD slot, it has two USB ports and an HDMI port. The 1366x768 pixel display is surprisingly good, although it does need to be at the right angle, as is the case with most laptops I've used. The default screen brightness is toned down when it's being used on the battery, but I changed that to run at 100%, and the run time is still very good.This seems like the perfect little computer, not just for travel, but also for someone who does everything on his/her phone and pad - needing a real computer only once in awhile. I was briefly tempted by the 14" version, which is about the same price, but the 12" version is significantly lighter, and it fits easily in my under-the-seat travel bag.As I noted, this computer has been my go to link to the world while I've been on an extended vacation in the Bahamas, and it's been great. A very big thumbs up for a light, cheap, simple, and effective laptop.
You get what you paid for. I purchased this as a personal laptop since I really have no need for anything incredibly fancy, just something for basic daily use and travel. It's very lightweight which I love, small and was very easy to tote around when traveling during the summer. The battery life is fantastic. This, however, is what I would call a "quirky" device. The mouse track pad is very sensitive, so I plug in a wireless resolving the issue. It does not like being put in sleep or rest mode, I find the screen does not want to turn on after waking, I always power off. Don't hope to store much, get a micro SD or USB drive. It's an OK PC, I use MACs at work, making it a strange transition, but if you just need it for basic web surfing, basic documents, it's a handy little laptop.
I really wanted to love this computer. I always do a lot of research before I buy things and the biggest complaint on this computer was that it was slow. I can live with slow. I just wanted something that I could take to work with me to access documents and literature. This computer was so slow I couldn't even access the internet. You'll need to buy a micro SD card for extra storage if you want to update Windows. That wasn't a big deal for me. Any of these cheap computers with 32gb storage can barely handle windows. The build quality seemed pretty good for the price. The only thing I couldn't deal with was how slow it was. I had to send this one back and get something with a faster processor. The all day battery life was nice with the ATOM processor but it just couldn't handle Windows 10. I ended up getting a little blue Dell Inspiron for about $50 and it has a celeron processor, which is a little faster but sacrifices battery life. It also has a touch screen and folds all the way around like a tablet. It's so much faster and feels like a better laptop, although it has a few drawbacks also. The ASUS had a better touch pad and I liked the location of the power button compared to the Dell. Oh, and the speakers are horrible on the ASUS. The Dell is very loud, like unbelievably loud for a laptop with this price. Overall, the ASUS is well built but it's too slow for even the most basic tasks, such as checking email, and the speakers are very bad. Get the touchscreen Dell for $250.
When it works right it is a great little laptop. But the rest of/majority of the time it struggles to find wifi signal and is constantly shutting down and restarting with the blue screen of death. I just bought it 7 months ago and it's already useless. I treated it well, kept it in a protective sleeve and nope. Save yourself and spend a few extra bucks for something that'll work!
I can't find the power cord anywhere on line, so I fear what will happen once I need a new one. Other than that, it works as well as expected of a "computer" this size.UPDATE: Over time I started experiencing more and more errors. I only use it for light browsing and viewing pdf files, which I often deleted after viewing. Now the computer freezes and restarts multiple times a day. I have reset the computer to the original manufacture settings and it's still crashing. Please spend more money and get something that will last.
This is a great little laptop to move around with. Especially for the price. I'm used to my phone's screen size so I'm not feeling any difference with the screen. If you're not looking to do graphics and run heave software then this is perfect. I use it to surf the net and and for ms office. The charge lasts really long. I charge it every 2 days. Or 1 if I'm binge watching netflix. The screen quality is great for what it is and the price you're paying. The drive is.way too small. It can i have a printer and ms office installed and nothing else can fit. Programme files takes up 90 percent of thespace.
Not very pleased with this computer. It is a replacement of the first that failed after setup. This one has a malfunctioning mouse. It sticks on the screen and causes the screen to increase or decrease rapidly in size or jumps to where it was not directed. I find I have to depend more on my other devices. I use it only when I am exceptionally calm and not it a hurry because this extreme frustration raises a risk of a heart attack real rapidly. It is not good to have the stress level in the red zone when the device has a malfunction.
Small but mighty. Haven't had any issues with it being slow so far but I am a little careful with how many programs I have running simply because I know it isn't exactly the most powerful notebook. Keyboard is great and responsive, display is decent (nothing magnificent but come on, it's only $200), the charge lasts a surprisingly long time, and it's pretty cute. The plastic casing makes it look a little cheaper but not exactly a deal breaker. Only weird thing is that the volume will turn itself up or down after it's asleep so be cautious with the volume to protect your ear drums.
This is a super great laptop for the price I paid! I was a little bit apprehensive prior to purchasing this laptop due to reviews other people had written about its functionality and lack of storage space. However, I have purchased an additional micro SD card to store my files and have downloaded a handful of programs, yet the laptop is still functioning rather well!I am a college student and my last laptop of broke down on me toward the end of this past academic year, so I was looking for something small and lightweight that would provide all the basic functions I would need as a college student who travels fairly frequently. This laptop is wonderful if you have the appropriate expectations for the price that you paid.
Advertised as "FREE 1yr Office 365 Subscription Included"That is NOT true. I contacted Asus and they said "After reviewing the serial number on your case, I have verified that this particular unit did not leave the Manufacturing Facility with a one year Office subscription. If the unit was advertised with the said offer you should consult your place of purchase to verify the offer code to redeem Office subscription."
Excellent notebook.The battery lasts many hours.Adequate disk space (for OS) but I recommend adding an additional SD card to store Documents, Pictures & Videos.. I am using it without problems an SanDisk Extreme 64GB micro SD.I wish it had a keyboard with backlight.
Great job by Garret for his review (that's what sold me). Take time to read it. He is spot on. This is an amazing portable laptop. And for only 4GB RAM, it performs VERY well. Battery life is exceptional. Light/portable. Way better than any tablet. Screen is crisp and clear. Keyboard feel is great. Mousepad works great (not oversensitive). Plugable Bluetooth mouse works great with this. Will allow me to be very productive on the road. HIGHLY recommend!!
You get what you pay for. Computer has around 11 gb of hard drive space once it's done updating. It can't run much. Most apps auto shut off after starting and getting the blue loading cursor. Constantly downloading and redownloading Microsoft Store apps so it'll drain your internet allowance as well.
Excellent product, ASUS Quality. The full size keyboard is a nice feature. Windows as expected has some performance limitations. Overall an excellent product and value for the money.
Well.. I hate when this happens, but the product did not work as it should of right out of the box / brand new. The wi-fi would not turn on. I called Amazon technical support and they couldn't diagnose the problem. Amazon technical 3 way called me in with ASUS technical support and they could not resolve the issue either. This is too bad because it was to be a surprise present for my wife.
A tad slow for internet searches, even on cable. I use it as for streaming audio or as a lightweight laptop when traveling. So still worth the price so far. Have had it about a month. Pleased with my previous Asus netbook -- five years for a bit more than $300, and my current ASUS 17" laptop is toodling along after 3+ years so overall, I am pleased with the brand. But . . . I mostly use these for web surfing and writing. No big image files, no gaming.
I did my research when I went purchased this laptop last February. Iâm a college student that needed to be able to write papers and read assignments on the go, and of course watch a youtube video here and there. This laptop is a nightmare for me - it takes 30 minutes to turn on sometimes, doesnât last more than 2 hrs off of the charger, and takes forever to load pages/open programs no matter my connection. It crashes on me and starts updates in the middle of use. Iâm very unimpressed and super bummed that it didnât work out. I guess I have to spend more to get something at the bottom level of decent, so itâs partly my fault. I donât know if these issues would be covered by warranty or anything (maybe I got a faulty one, I dunno), but for now Iâm disappointed with the product.
So far so good, works like a charm after initial set up, removed the bloatware and got the Windows 10 pro option for free. Windows 10 S is only for Windows apps, no outside programs can be installed. Using a micro SD to use as disk space. its a descent speed for my needs, its not that slow once the bloatware is removed. Overall its compact and thin, perfect for travel.
This is first and foremost a budget computer. It runs noticeably slower than any phone or more powerful computer, but it isn't a hindrance. I purchased an extra 128Gb micro SD to expand the space and recommend that.Currently use it for Word, Excel, Spotify, Netfix, and web browsing.
I owned a 5 year old laptop that was a hassle to carry around campus. It lost half its charge upon starting up when I had charged it up completely the night before. This cinder block laptop took up all the space on my desk. I needed a low-cost efficient laptop that could hold a charge and do every basic need for a college student. This was the answer! I am grateful of my purchase!
Good machine, but If your looking for an upgrade to the x205ta, don't bother. I have used them side by side and I really can't find any difference in performance, what-so-ever. The little gain in processor speed is not significant and the extra ram 2 gigs if ram is used up by the 64 bit operating system. I think the only real upgrade is the USB 3 port, which most people don't need anyway. Battery life is also about the same. Good machine for surfing the Web and watchingstreaming video. Light, long battery, decent speakers and screen and performance.
TL:DR on bottomIt's a fantastic little laptop for students. It's super light weight, decent power, and has a long battery life (mine was used and still has a 13hr battery life). However, there are a few little kinks that prevent it from becoming a 5-star product. The first and foremost, when you are charging your battery it seems to have a noticeable impact on the processing power, for example, it's seamless when streaming 720p on YouTube, but when plugged in, it starts to have latency issues, and you will have to either wait until the video completely loads or go down to 480p. There was also an issue with my unit where the "R" key is slightly off, so if you press it in the wrong spot it wont register. Lastly, the memory is very small, so a flash drive is going to be mandatory. Other than that, its a super nice laptop. Clean, functional, quick, long battery and light (both in weight and brightness).TL:DR = Strongly suggest if you need a casual laptop for school, it's not a gaming laptop, and get a flash drive for it.
For $199? Are you kidding? This thing is great. I have an iPad, but needed something non-Mac to take with and run Word and actually for one client, Word Perfect. This little guy does the trick. Keep in mind, I don't have excessive expectations of it, just a little word processing is all I do with it, a little web surfing and sometimes I put a disc in my external drive and watch that, but otherwise what more could you ask for for that price. I mean honestly!
My computer crashed just before finals week and I was in desperate need of a laptop...I wish I had taken more time in researching this one though...I read some of the reviews (good and bad) and decided that I would give it a shot, besides, who doesn't want a free one year subscription to mircrosoft office?!I thought it was great at first. I went form a 5.5lb 15.5" to this little thing and loved how easy it was going to be to carry it around with me at school. After exploring through it and setting it up how I wanted I started to see problems. When I was typing notes for a class, it lagged behind and would only type the last 3 or 4 letters of the sentence.Another time I was searching the web and it completely froze on me. This wasn't the normal wait-for-it-to-catch-up freeze. It stayed like that for a solid 15 minutes and I couldn't even move the mouse to exit out.The last thing that got me to make the final decision to return this item (only 3 days after getting it) was when it was updating. I turned it on to work on homework and it stayed on a green screen showing that the updates were "100%" but it took it two hours to get off that page and then restarted the updates.I don't have time for a computer that is so slow and messed up. I need one I can rely on. Maybe this will be a great computer for you, maybe not. If you want advice, don't take the risk.
Do not try to be gaming or running heavy programs on this for obvious reasons, but this laptop is very light, portable, amazingly fast, and very capable for it's price. I use this for school and general business and it is great. The eemc storage is lightning fast and the battery can last days of medium use.
It might a bit too early to write a review, but I've had this for a few solid days now and overall impression is excellent.For $200, you have to forgive its shortcomings and set your expectations realistically-- but it is still impressive what you can do with a laptop computer that costs less than your average tablet. Even at $300 or $400, I'd say this is still a good buy.Like a lot of people, I have multiple computers that each serve a niche. I have: Apple MacBook Air 13" Early-2014 (i5 with 256GB SSD), iPad 2 32GB, Samsung Note 4, Note 5, Note 3, Galaxy S3, Galaxy S4, Galaxy S5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 4S, etc. [I buy and sell used and fix phones, so I have a lot of phones: main phone now is the Note 4...], and an old home-built AMD Windows 7 Desktop (used to be gaming machine with 2 video cards).My #1 rule with laptops is that it has to be light and portable, otherwise why bother. In real estate, it's "location, location, location". In laptops, it's "weight, weight, weight". This is why my MacBook Air is my main computer. I carry that thing everywhere and battery life is great. But alas! I have a need for a Windows computer, and my old home-brewed desktop is aging (almost 10 years old now) and I figure a lightweight laptop would be nice. Since it's not my main computer, I can forgo a lot of features and storage space, so I was looking for something compact and light. I used to have a "netbook" from Samsung about 5 years ago which was very small with cramped keyboard and very very slow, and I wasn't impressed. So I bought this E200HA with some hesitation that it might be the same type of "netbook". For $200, what the hell, I said...I mainly need a Windows machine because I currently run a few Windows-only programs on my Mac via emulation and as anyone knows, emulation is very laggy and slow. So the 2 things my Windows laptop needs to run are: 1. Quickbooks, which I use for my small business accounting [their Mac version doesn't have features that their Windows version has, which I need (inventory-related features)], and 2. Proprietary BMW software for reading error codes and programming the car (INPA, EDIBAS, NC Expert, etc.). Mind you, I've been running these on my Mac for a few years now, but at painfully slow speeds. The Asus E200HA handles these software well, so it serves it purpose and therefore I am happy.But beyond that, it impressed me with its long battery life (I got about 11 hours at 80% screen brightness and moderate use), multi-task ability (4GB of RAM)-- I have 10 tabs open in Google Chrome and no lag. I don't know what some of the other reviewers saying you can't have more than 2 tabs open... YouTube videos stream fine. I have an average of about 3-4 programs open in addition to my Chrome browser and it works fine, no lag, no crashes.The computer's internal drive is 32GB SSD (solid-state drive-- no moving parts), which after the default Windows 10 64-Bit Home Edition install leaves about 17GB of free space for storage. I put in a 64GB MicroSD card in the slot for extra storage, but haven't used it yet. I'm down to 8GB free on my main SSD. A 128GB SD card also works, FYI, even though officially Asus says 64GB max. The faster USB 3 port is to the left and the slower USB 2 port is to the right. They work as intended. I hooked up my external Seagate Slim 2TB drive to the USB 3.0 port and transfers are fast as expected. The power supply looks a bit like a USB or Thunderbolt, but it's not-- it's a proprietary plug. The charger itself is very light, like a cell phone charger. External video is possible via a mini HDMI port (you need a mini-HDMI to standard-HDMI cable or adapter-- the cable is like $7 from AmazonBasics, not too bad). The trackpad is large like on a Macbook, and has gesture, but not as elegant or good as the one on my Mac, but still good for 2-finger scrolling and touch tapping. The keyboard is a bit plasticy and light and a bit smaller scale than a full-size keyboard, but not too shabby. Screen isn't anything impressive, but it gets quite bright at 100% brightness. ASUS has a guarantee on dead pixels, so that's good to know.All in all, for $200 this is quite a bargain and a great little computer. The 32GB internal storage was a concern for me, but if this isn't your main computer, it's nothing to worry about. If it is, you need to budget ~$40 for a 128GB SD Card or ~$80 for an external USB 3.0 2TB drive.
It does the job for the price! Main uses: schoolHighlights:1. Long battery life (coming from a gaming laptop)2. Charging does not take too long (I don't keep track but it doesn't feel long)3. Light and portable4. I think the video memory is good enoughFaults:1. Only 32gb of EMMIC (something like that). I did buy a 128gb micro sd card, but there are limitations. I cannot update my computer due to a lack of memory so keep that in mind.2. If you have too many programs and windows opened it will lag! What I mean by too many is windows word (with 2 files opened), google browser with 5 + tabs, and another windows open, trying to look for another file.overall, it is great for what it is. Adequate enough for school uses.
Very light and easy to carry around. Would like to have more choice of colors, but it only offers one color. The cursor is quite sensitive and easy to navigate, comes with a HDMI port so that you can stream videos to big screen HDTV. (needs a micro-HDMI to HDMI converter, not provided with this product). ASUS gestures provides more convenient way to move around the key board. One thing could be improved is that the CAP Lock key provides no indication when it is pressed.
To anyone wondering what a 200 dollar laptop can do, buy it in a heartbeat. Needed something to replace my 3.2 ghz dual core amd apu with 2gb of graphics and a ssd. Trust me, it works really fast. In fact, I can't tell the difference between my old laptop and this. I was actually contemplating getting a macbookFor someone contemplating purchasing a MacBook, get this. It does everything that an ideal MacBook owner does brilliantly. Check email, streaming HD content, Spotify, ITunes etc is just as fast as a MacBook 12 inch. It has a quad core processor compared to the Intel M chip in the MacBook. Both can't do video editing, both have a 480p camera and for 20 bucks, you can get a 64 gig microsd card, making the storage capacity the same.The battery life is absolutely spectacular. For someone like me doing the regulars like web browsing, movie watching and document processing, it has failed to give a battery life less than 11 hours. It also has a good standby time. I mean leave it on sleep for a night and the battery hardly drops more than 2 percent with wifi running in the background.The icing on the cake is the free office with 1TB cloud support for a year. I mean office 365 for 5 devices retails at 90 bucks a year and office for a single pc costs 150 bucks. I mean literally use this for a year, throw it and get a new one with office support. That way you'll always keep upgrading your processor and ram.With 8 tabs open, Spotify running in the background, and word open, it hasn't slowed down. The 4gigs of ram helps.The only downside is that windows updates reduce the onboard storage quite a bit. To get rid of that issue, go to storage and delete the older windows version everytime you update. It automatically deletes it in 30 days anyways.Do yourself a favor and save some money
While it seems to be a decent laptop, especially for the price and for surfing, it has over the past two months frozen up at least 4 times and I have to force a shut off. I may invoke the warranty and request a replacement, if it continues to do this "freezing/unresponsive" habit. I still would say it is worth buying, especially when one's budget is limited. The features it has for the cost make it a good value.
Great computer for the price but you should probably factor in a ~$30 SD Card to get some more storage. There are a lot of things moving to the web so storage space is less and less important but only 32GBs hurts when the Windows 10 Operating System takes up about 28 GBs, there's going to be some things that you need to install on this machine.Going to be using this computer for school and need to get Visual Studio installed but don't have the space, I'll report back on any issues with that installation but looking at minimum requirements for Visual Studio everything should be pretty smooth.
I bought this laptop for a family member that basically surfs the web and does some light Office suite work. The performance is pretty good; it seems quick and not a lot of lag. As far as the hard drive space goes, that is easily resolved with the addition of an external SD card to provide more space. So from a performance standpoint I would recommend this laptop.My cons are with Microsoft (big surprise, huh?). The 14" model comes with Windows 10 S, which is Microsoft's "Big Brother" version of the operating system that does not allow you to load any third party applications (i.e. - Google Chrome) that are not sanctioned by the Microsoft store. No problem, it comes with a free upgrade to Win10 Pro which allows you to load apps. So I performed the upgrade. After the upgrade and verification it was running Win10 Pro I still could not load apps because Device Guard was still active. So I followed the directions online from Microsoft to disable Device Guard then rebooted the laptop. IT BRICKED THE OPERATING SYSTEM!!! (NOTE: Not 100% sure if this was because of the changes I made or one of the KB updates that does not play well with AMD processors). So, after 2 hours of resetting the OS I'm finally running Win 10 Pro and I am able to load apps. So, buy this if you are happy just running MS authorized applications, or if you want to fight with Microsoft over the right to load any third party software, and spend hours trying to upgrade and make changes to group policy and installed MS components. Lastly, the laptop did not come with Office loaded. When I clicked on the "Get Office" link off the start menu it returns an error message that a specific DLL was not found and to re-install the application (re-install and application that was not installed in the first place???). Then after the reset I clicked on the link and it took me to the MS site to BUY OFFICE365!! I'm still fighting with this one.
Bought this for school for pretty basic stuff (research papers and presentations). It worked just fine for about a year then the memory filled up almost instantly for no apparent reason. I only have the basic Microsoft Office programs and Adobe Acrobat installed and have less than one gig left (I also have no pictures/videos and very few papers stored on this computer). It refuses to allow me to delete anything so it's just a paperweight than can access the internet.
I ended up returning this. I had the X205TA for 2 years. This upgraded model is not any faster than my older model with 2GB of RAM and 32GB SSD. I wish it was better because this form factor is exactly what I am looking for at the weight that works best for carrying this around at school. The amount of lag made this unable to work for my needs.
It's... acceptable. You get what you pay for. I take it to school for taking notes and writing and occasionally browsing the internet, but it struggles with even some basic tasks. But it runs free of errors, it's simple enough to set up and gets programs running, and so far it hasn't had any issues. I'll probably replace this with something with more power when I can, though.
I have had this laptop for a month, and I use it just about everyday for school and work. It is perfect to take in my backpack! So light and portable. The battery is strong and lasts more than long enough.. Most I have used it for was 10 hours in the library for online math homework. Reception and connectivity is a breeze... It connects to the wifi no problem! Gold is a sexy color too! Yes, It is a little smaller than your average laptop or macbook, but the resolution is good and I find it easy enough to read. The body feel is a heftier more hardy metal than I had seen in other windows models around town. I was personally shopping a TON to decide on a laptop in the 180-350 price range, and it was so hard to decide which laptops were riskiest vs going to be worth it... I decided on this windows ASUS over a google chromebook and I am SO happy I did! ASUS Windows = a great machine. Microsoft edge is also surprisingly fast and useful. The keyboard is quite nice to type on and overall it feels sturdy and the clicking has a "snappy" feel that makes working fun.Here is a video of me un-boxing it.SIDE NOTES*Buy a sleeve to go with it for safe keeping.*Get a 3 year warranty! It was 60$. I got one. Have not had to use it yet though.*I have a WD passport drive that I use to store my documents and files, so the hardware disk space wasn't a big factor in buying choice for me. It is a great idea to get an external drive, if you don't have one, get one!
Though my son loves it and it works good, the lack of HD and available space means you are stuck with Edge browser because there is not enough room for extra apps and programs. We bought a microSD to add storage for files and are still tweaking to get the most out of it. Battery life is good and the size is perfect if it is used on the go. I would not suggest it as your only computer . It is perfect for someone like my son who has a monster gaming computer at home and uses this one to stick in his backpack .
I bought the ASUS machine because I needed a Windows machine to perform some software QA for a site that was developed on a Mac. Also, I can give it to my housemates when they need to use a computer to get on the Web and not worry about having the machine with all my data on it getting damaged.I was expecting it to be slow, given comments that other users on social media have made on Atom-based computers. It's about half as fast as my Mac, but it did cost an order of magnitude less.I have used it about five hours so far, and the only problems that I had were related to learning Windows 10. I hadn't used a Windows machine in years, and I'd never used Windows 10. But, given that I've had long experience with computers of all types, I adopted rapidly.I haven't used it long enough to find out the veracity of the all-day battery claim, but I'm running it right now on batteries and Windows 10 indicates that it has over a dozen hours to go.Storage space was not that much of a concern for me. For those who worry about it, I had 17 GB available out of the 32 GB with Windows 10 loaded. Plenty for what I was going to do with the machine.
After about 6 months of daily use, the shift, ctrl, and alt, tab keys on the left side of the keyboard have stopped working. Tried a new install of windows, to no avail. Probably a hardware issue, but I don't have the knowledge to fix it myself. Unfortunate, but it really sucks not being able to alt+tab, or use shortcuts.QC might be an issue with ASUS, just wished I didn't get a lemon :/
This is a $200 computer. I know that's obvious, but seriously, think about it. A normal computer should cost around $700, right?I already have a good laptop, but it's a bit bulky and I wanted something smaller that I could take while traveling. I figured, I'm not using it for games or photo editing, the most I need it to do is run Word. I thought this computer could handle that.Honestly, I've ready good reviews about ASUS, but this is my first ASUS computer. And it's also my first computer running Windows 10. So I don't know exactly where to lay the blame, but this thing is brand new and slower than my 5 year old laptop. If I'm running Excel and try to open an image file, there's a good 30% chance that alone will overload this poor excuse for a computer.So, if you're looking for a $200 paperweight that's in the shape of a computer, here you go.
So far, so good. First thing I did was boot into the BIOS and disable secure boot. Second was installing Ubuntu Linux and replacing the preinstalled Windows image.It runs well and has a pretty good battery life.
I am hopelessly in love with this computer. Fabulous keyboard. Very fast boot up and shut down. Slightly slow when playing simple games, but youtube works great. Sound is mediocre, but with earbuds sound is fine. Unbelievable for a computer that only cost 200 bucks. I bought this as an experiment, figuring it was too cheap to be any good. Nope. Works fine. Seems very sturdy. Absolutely no problems with it right out of the box. I guess, if I had to change anything, I'd get the same computer with a Chromebook OS instead of MS. But the MS OS works fine. I love the ten hour battery. No cord to deal with in coffee shops. I use Google docs and store pics in the cloud. Bought a chip to store files on. Bought a Amazon sleeve with this that works fine.
I love it.. very chic in its light weight. Fits into any tote but not too small of a screen.I have only been using it for about 2-3 days so I hope all goes well .Worth the purchase.
I really liked the look of this small laptop, it's a very pretty light gold color, but not a flashy gold. It is a great laptop for the simpler tasks like email, browsing the web, word processing, and playing movies/ videos. Be aware that the 32gb storage will hardly get you anywhere. After the most recent Windows update that installed after I turned the laptop on, there was about 9gb left (after also installing a some basic programs like Avira, Scrivener, Chrome, Flux, and a few others that are not too large). There is a micro SD card you can insert that you can set to default storage so all programs will install on it and the one I tried was a 200gb micro and it worked fine.The computer is pretty fast but some heavy websites will load slower despite a really fast internet connection. I had several tabs open on Chrome as well as a few basic programs and I didn't find it lagging though, which is good.The screen is one of the biggest problems for me as it is so small, the defaulted resolution and text sizes make the print very tiny so if you like a larger font you will have to increase the zoom, text size, and/or resolution. This makes some programs unable to have their windows show up fully on the screen, which can be a real problem if you don't remember where the OK and Cancel buttons were since you cannot see them if you're in a popup window. In particular, Scrivener has this issue where opening up a window like Tools will not show the bottom of the popup window when you have the zoom increased. The other thing that makes this screen a little difficult is the glossy glare which can make it hard on the eyes and very hard to see outside because it also has very limited tilt on the screen so your viewing angles are not the best at times. I do find that the screen is very bright and crisp and slightly better than ASUS VivoBook R416SA-EH21 14", which is the larger, slightly better version of this laptop.The keyboard is my favorite part of this laptop since it is a full keyboard but it has smaller keys and they are closer together. It is fantastic for those that have smaller hands and shorter fingers like me. The keys are chiclet so they click almost like a mechanical keyboard and those are my favorite. It is very easy and smooth to type on.The laptop I received has a good trackpad that glides nicely and has very responsive click buttons. The only thing I had issues with are the multi-touch gestures where you can use two or three fingers to scroll vertically and horizontally. Scrolling vertically with two fingers seemed to make the mouse move all over, despite how careful I was with making sure my two fingers were together and making contact at the same time. The scroll worked most of the time but when it didn't you sometimes accidentally clicked and moved things you didn't mean to.Overall I would give this pc a 8 out of 10. You cannot beat the small weight of a little over 2lbs for this price point and hardware, that is one of the big pluses if you want the ultimate portability. It's perfect for those that don't mind the trackpad issues or smaller screen/font size issues, but for my purpose, which was for writing short stories, I think the issue with having to make the font so much larger to see it comfortably will be a deal breaker since I use Scrivener primarily.If you want something a little larger with a little more power, I would recommend the larger version of this laptop, the ASUS VivoBook R416SA-EH21 14", which is only 1lb heavier.Â ASUS VivoBook R416SA-EH21 14" Full HD Laptop (Quad-Core N3700, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 128GB eMMC, Windows 10), Metallic Gray
This is a great little laptop! It's extremely portable, and the battery lasts a very long time. Sure, sometimes it gets a little laggy when I have several tabs up, but that was to be expected. I inserted an SD card and that's where I keep all my files. I decided I would purchase this because I'm studying abroad and did not want to haul my heavy $1,000 laptop overseas. This is probably not a good "main" laptop, but definitely a great side/travel computer.
I bought this laptop as a lightweight secondary computer for traveling. As a result, I have used it lightly over about 14 months since purchase. In everyday use the computer is unable to keep up with basic tasks such as browsing. This machine would probably work well with an older operating system installed, but as bloated as Windows 10 is, it just isn't sufficient. Because Windows 10 updates are not optional, the 32GB hard drive fills with huge updates immediately and this constantly bogs the computer.In additional to performance issues, this machine is just poorly constructed. As I found out the hard way, the screen is unusually delicate. Unfortunately I made the mistake of paying for a new screen instead of cutting my losses. A month later, the screen stopped responding-- it still lights, but won't display anything. The touch pad has never worked well and, somehow, often inputs a right click rather than a left click and vice versa. I have had plenty of glitches, freezes, and crashes despite using the stock configuration with virtually no installations of my own.The benefits of the computer are that it is insanely light and has excellent battery life-- at least the advertised 10hrs if not more. I can put it to sleep and leave it in my bag for a week and open it up again with plenty of charge left. These have made it excellent for my application but the issues have not justified the convenience.
Personally, I did not like this laptop. Initially, I thought that this is a perfect laptop for simple web browsing. But, when I got this laptop and started browsing I did not like the speed of browsing. Pages load slowly despite super good internet connection. Processor often touches its 100% capacity and slows the laptop. Not at all recommended. RETURNED the laptop
This little computer is a good value for the price - but I am a little disappointed in how quickly it started slowing down. I've had it about 6 months or so, and it already takes forever to load webpages (it was pretty snappy when it first arrived). It's probably a computer health thing I need to look into, but I would have hoped that it would have been more resilient despite the low price.
I returned it. I was skeptical of the reviews on here saying it didn't have enough memory to even update windows, but they were true. I had it for a couple of weeks and it kept giving me error messages because there wasn't enough space to update. I didn't download much onto it, just Microsoft Office, which is a necessity since I am a student. I saved all files on a removable drive, but even the basic operating system was too much for the small amount of storage space. It might be good from someone only doing web based stuff, but if you're going to need to download even basic stuff, don't buy this laptop.
This thing goes everywhere with me, and with such a good battery life I have no worries leaving the charger at home. My only complaint is the speakers. They're tinny and don't get very loud, but for under $200 I'll bring some headphones. The Asus warranty is also pretty fantastic.
It's a good buy. I'm a college student I just needed something to do my papers and send emails. It's neat and compact. Lightweight and easy to carry around.
Got exactly what was advertised and it works well the boot speed is pretty fast just as expectedAfter a couple months of use Iâm dropping a star due to heap touch pad the right click stopped working but you can still tap with 2 fingers so itâs still good but the storage runs out and I have to keep reinstalling windows every few months... I try a bunch of methods to free up memory but windows updates keeps eating away and Iâm unable to recover much storage... However the laptop performs fine I play games like runescape on lowest graphics smoothly or left 4 dead. Overall itâs still a good buy just donât expect much on storage itâs best to have an external so Iâd say It was worth the money still after all this time.UPDATEthe laptop is defeinitely not worth $400 you can get a far better one an acer with ddr4 ram with m.2ssd support for $350.after punching the touch pad and denting the laptop i attempted to straighten it which fixed my touch pad making it work perfect since i had a right clicking issue before hitting my laptop so the laptop is pretty good just dont pay $400 for it i paid $200 right here for it and id say its worth $250 most since you can get a far better one im bumping back to 5 stars since everything works perfectlyJust bored and decided to add in another review.. itâs been some more months and products still functions perfectly fine!
I bought this for my own use for when I feel like working from the recliner. I need to have several tabs open while creating a document, and I have no complaints about the processing speed. I don't need to do any graphics-heavy work or gaming so can't speak to that, but this is perfect for my use.
This little laptop exceeded the expectations for the price. The keyboard is really good, you can type fast after using it for a few hours. I bought this laptop only for traveling because of the size. At first when I saw this laptop I realized that it is really handy because it's small and does not weight much at the point that I believe one book could be more heavy. It is really good computer for college students. My son played with it for some time and it is now considering buying it for college. The computer for the price and specs is okay. You can browse the internet with a few tabs open, watch videos and have some programs open and it will run smoothly. To conclude, I recommend this computer to anyone who wants it to use it for traveling or for college students who needs to type papers and use the internet.
This is super lightweight, has enough space for the basics of what I need as a student. Comes with Windows 10. Very small, very reliable. Sometimes I have an issue with finding wifi on this, but restarting almost always fixes this bug.
I am typing on it now. It's signfiicantly faster than I expected. I expect to use it for a lot of foreign travel. Battery life seems to be about 10 hours or so. Movies are fine.Sound is better than I expected. I use it mostly for wordprocessing and simple spread sheets. Keyboard is fine, works well with my mouse. I've added a 64gb microSD, but haven't had to use it. Why can't they put in a regular HDMI slot?The main thing I don't like is Windows 10, specifically their new photo program, which is significantly worse than the previous one. I wish I knew how to get my old one back.
Fantastic lightweight computer for on the go work. I am a Realtor and need to get full pc access to my programs that can't properly download from a tablet or phone. I looked at many other small computes at twice the price and found the performance of this lightweight machine to work perfectly. It is anot a full day working machine, but it is great for travel, short work in the car and for kids. It doe everything a big machine does in a much smaller package.
I wish I would have read more about os but the os version it shipped with was terrible. Although the laptop performed as expected it was just so-so. I purchased this for my niece and will ask her for her opinion and update this review.
Delivered on time, great product. Good quality for a much cheaper price. I'm impressed with the battery life, lasts more than 13 hours. I love to carry it around because it's lightweight. I love everything about it except for a minor catch - it comes with Windows 10 OS which sometimes (not really often though, rarely happens) freezes when I wake it from sleep mode. I have to long press the power button. Not the laptop's fault though, my other laptop which has a much powerful specs also freezes like this. So I'm planning to downgrade my OS. Despite this very tiny problem, I'd still buy it even if I know about it before the purchase. Anyway, overall, it's awesome! A bang for the buck!
Its a great laptop for the price that it is. Annoying that there is not much space on the main hard drive, I just got a sd card to insert. The battery life on power saver lasts over 10 hours doing light work which is what I bought it for. The size is also great.. Easy to carry around and does not take up much desk space.
It's ok for the price. I would have hoped the system would have booted faster, and sometimes the system can be slow. But most of the time it is pretty responsive. You will need the expandable memory if you buy this because windows hogs most of the hard drive space. No mechanical problems so far. I haven't tested the webcam. The keyboard is small but nice. I like the touchpad. The display is pretty good but I only have watched 720p video so far.
Update: see the original review belowIt's been a year and I'm finally out of space which is fine because I can buy more storage (ie. Micro SD Card) if you're unsure about buying a mostly cloud based laptop go for it but know that you're not doing for space. I would definitely purchase this again and stand by my five star review.*****I didn't want to review it til I was sure and I'm certain this computer is legit. It's lightweight, affordable, and pretty to look at. I even found a matching wireless mouse. I've had this laptop for a little over a month and I enjoy how fast it is. I use it for word processing mostly and blogging. The fact that you can also add your own storage with a micro SD Card is also a big win. I'm thinking of purchasing an external hard drive for more storage. I haven't run into any cons so far. I can watch videos, write, and not worry about any lag. It's so light that you can carry i t with one hand. The color isn't a shiny gold and I don't care. I would recommend this for anyone that's on the fence about purchasing this.
Just what I needed. Thin. Light weight. Completely silent. Amazing battery life.I use for email, surfing web, Microsoft Excel, SSHing to Linux server. For these (and more) tasks, this little system has more than enough power.Size is just right to fit into my "man purse" tactical shoulder bag. (actually, that is not a joke!)Given the opportunity, I would opt for more built in RAM to give the system a little breathing room (currently using 22GB of 29GB very little 3rd party SW installed), but that said, I'm doing fine.
Great computer! I got this computer's prior model four years ago and it lasted through me banging my backpack in college 4 years. I was surprised that it could be lightweight and also durable. I actually never had any issues with my previous computer except that it eventually had outdated technology. Since I was needing to pay about $100 to get Microsoft office anyway, I figured I would just get a computer with it on it. So basically, I got a $100 quality computer.
Great netbook! I have not had any performance issues with it and it has been running great. I have had it for a few weeks now and I can tell that its better made then some of the cheaper lower quality machines I have had. just be aware this is a netbook, not a laptop. Basically this means its smaller, lighter, and less powerful then a full laptop. But it does exactly what I need and wanted.
Fresh out of the box and it's running incredibly slow. I must have gotten a bad one (as did many reviewers it seems), as the computer specs are decent and plenty of reviewers say it runs fast. As is, I am currently running Google Chrome and nothing else and even that is absurdly slow.Checked task manager and was at 80-90% CPU usage and 70+ memory- running just a web browser! Unacceptable. Try to run more than 3 tabs and it's game over. Something ain't right.
love it- works perfectly EXCEPT it didn't come with a touch pad driver ...strange...but easily fixed.I really like it, good screen, good keyboard, fast processor (for what I do which is just browsing and youtube).so, either for a primary or backup pc this is a great buy.
Needed a small footprint PC that I could take to conferences -- something that I could carry along with a writing pad. This is perfect. My big concern was that I need to run some pretty sophisticated programs on it -- including Dragon Naturally Speaking and Scrivener. The processor handles these programs just fine. Another concern was networking. My old PC used to max out in the 6Mbps range -- but this one delivers 15Mbps consistently on the same equipment. Nice! My next concern was the limited drive space. I use the 32 GB for programs -- and with the great networking, I keep most of my files in the cloud (One Drive and iCloud). Sweet! My final concern was the keyboard -- would it be large enough to accommodate power typing. The designers did away with the unneeded calculator keys, and that leaves plenty of space for uncramped typing. Good performance; fast networking that reaches farther than my old PC; plenty of drive space for my program; nice keyboard -- and great price -- I'm very pleased.
Look, there's a lot of value here, don't get me wrong. For a little bit more than the cost of the operating system (OS), you get a whole computer. But there one feature about this laptop that makes me dread having to work on it.THE TRACKPAD ON THIS IS UNHOLY AWFUL GARBAGE. It is the most piercing singular source of frustration I have ever experienced with any electronics. It's garbage. It's accuracy is poor, it's registration is poor, it's multi-finger input is clumsy and imprecise, and every once in a while it just stops working entirely.Good buy if you want to also carry around a mouse.
I really like it. It works great and includes Office. The ram is twice what most in this price range has and the Atom quard core is fast. I put a 32 Gb micro sd in it and installed Portable apps on it to save the native hd space. I still have 11 Gb free space after installing Dropbox and syncing. If you use One drive format your micro sd to NSFS.
Unfortunately, all the positives for this laptop are overshadowed by the mouse touch pad. It is erratic and often the cursor is uncontrollable or disappears. I've gone to settings and tried to adjust the touch pad settings....no luck. It's an effort to enjoy the good features when battling the mouse and cursor. It will work with a USB wired mouse...but why should I not get the full benefit of the product. Again...unfortunate. I'm seriously considering returning the item.
Originally I had planned on going with a Chromebook, but after trying out a couple, I realized the sluggish browser based ChromeOS was way too slow for me. Enter this laptop, complete with Windows 10 and zero learning curve, fast browsing and just a good all around machine. This will meet the needs of anyone who isn't a power user (expecting to use it for gaming, video editing or any graphic/memory intensive programs is obviously going to end in disappointment), it will however surpass your expectations with battery life and speed during light use. Ultimately, I had to choose a system with more horsepower because I wanted something that will age a bit better. For the price range, you get so much value and it blows every Chromebook out of the water.
Laptop build quality is phenomenal for the price. However the specs are sub-par and it has lots of random disconnecting from wifi issues. It also has a problem where it glitches when you open the lid. Battery life is great, keyboard is comfortable, trackpad is bad. Spend around $100 more to get an i3 Dell laptop which surely will last longer than this.
Very good lap top (Chromebook). Plenty of file space for what I need because I store everything on flash drive anyway and the processor is fast enough for my online gaming, I use it for a lot of different things but gaming is what I got it for and it works just fine. No complaints.
I like the overall look and feel of the laptop, unfortunately it has quite a few problems.1. The keyboard is not level. The 'G' key is very obviously lower than the rest.2. It loses the D drive (my SD card) every 20 minutes, rendering it useless. And this laptop is not very useful without an SD card.3. The touchpad is great after reboot, but becomes jumpy after 20 minutes of use or so. It has happened many times when I am using the file explorer (with nearly disastrous results)It could have been a decent laptop, but I wouldn't know. Unfortunately these problems make the laptop unusable for me.Sadly it's not an isolated case. I have 4 Asus laptops sitting in my house right now. Three of them have similar issues with the touchpad, two of them have issues losing my D drive. The Zenbook I have has issues with GPU overheating (even though it has a fan). They all have features that impress me initially, but fatal flaws have kept them from being useful.So ASUS, please:* Keep the current configuration, perhaps with more HDD space* Keep the lightweight and good battery life* Fix the issue with sticky touchpad (I have accidentally deleted files so many times because of it)* USB3 thumb drives have to work (I have lost a whole drive worth of data because of it)* Overall better quality control* I am willing to pay more if you fix the above problems
im actually currently using this product right now and i bought it over a year ago. for the price its a darn good laptop and runs pretty well. i mostly use word and do school work and some browsing. i have to say this even saved me from wanting to purchase a mac its had its glitches but in reality for the price it gets the job done runs well and has significant storage. the camera is questionable but if youre video chatting it should be sufficient though it lags a little. but once again for the price its well worth it.
The size, speed, and weight are perfect to carry around. However, the hard drive only 30G. I can't do much running application. I tried to search for same size with bigger Hard drive. No luck. I like ASUS and I hope the manufacture could keep these features with bigger hard drive. The 4k SD adapter card can cost $25 and above.
I purchased this laptop for my wife as an early Christmas present. So far is has performed about as expected, with some slight surprises in speed. She plans on using this for web browsing and very light photo editing. Should any glaring defect present itself I will note it on this review.Being an ASUS product I'd expect nothing less than a quality Item. I've never had any issue with any of their products.
For doing simple things, email, college homework and the like is great. Not great for anything that's very demanding, it's easily the best budget computer out there
This is my first review on Amazon. The reason why is because I absolutely LOVE this laptop. At $200, this is a steal. Lightweight, incredible battery, and an overall sleek machine. Sound quality is fantastic, in my opinion, and the screen is very crisp and clear.Pros:-Size (incredible lightweight, portable and still functional)-RAM (4GB is pretty good for this little thing)-Speed (Don't expect blazing fast, but you won't need more than it delivers)-Screen (I like it a lot)-Sound (Also like the sound...very clear and gets loud)-Ports, webcam, etc.-12 hour battery life is really true!Cons:-Mouse pad could be improved. Settings help a lot.-Little storage space (which isn't an issue with the SD card slot)-Mini HDMI port...means I have to get another cable if I want to connect.Overall, I love it. It brings me joy every day. Always finding excuses to use it. Great product...have been recommending it to everyone I know!I've paired it with the following:Alolli Bluetooth Headphones Wireless In Ear Earbuds V4.1 Stereo Noise Isolating Sports Sweatproof Headset with Mic, Premium Bass Sound - BlackLogitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad, BlackLacdo 11.6 Inch Water Repellent Fabric Laptop Sleeve Case Bag / Notebook Bag Case for Apple MacBook Air 11.6-inch, New Macbook 12 inch Ultrabook Acer Asus Dell HP Toshiba Lenovo Chromebook, Gray
My son uses this for school. We didn't want to buy a very expensive one to advertise on his college campus. This computer is very light-weight and small enough that he can carry it with no problem. For school work, general navigation, this little laptop is great.I was going to buy another one but the price doubled?!! Too expensive when I just purchased it for half the price
A sweet little computer, perfect for my wife. The only issue, and it had nothing to do with the laptop, was Windows 10 and updating. It took 3.5 hours before I was able to use the laptop. If you get this nice Asus laptop just have a pot of coffee ready, or a drink or two, update and enjoy. My wife, who I have to gently push towards newer technology, is loving it.
Ultra light. Ultra thin. Ultra portable. Really fast. For a student, good deal.
I rolled the dice on this laptop when I was looking for a lightweight, small laptop for grad school and I don't regret it. It's surprisingly hard to find an 11 inch laptop that's not some app-dependent, hybrid tablet (which was totally NOT what I was looking for), so this was perfect. It's important to keep perspective here: This isn't a high-powered machine. What it is, is a no-frills, basic laptop for standard, every day use (emails, word processing, surfing the web). For those modest purposes, it's more than fast enough and the hard drive is more than enough if you're just saving papers, pdf's, recipes, school stuff, etc. Just to be safe, I doubled the storage with a mini SD card for cheap. So far, I'm most impressed with the laptop's battery life. I feel most companies exaggerate their devices battery life, but I really am getting 10-11 hours out of each charge. If you don't want to spend a lot of money for a decent computer, this is a great system. If you're doing graphic design, playing games, or recording/editing music (like I do on another laptop), look elsewhere. This laptop cost less than my textbooks and it's exceeded my expectations. Lastly, the "rose gold" isn't as garish a color as it sounds. It's like a steel/bronze color and it's pretty cool. Great laptop for what it is.
Got this as a gift for my girlfriend, didn't want her to keep carrying a heavy old laptop so I got her this one instead and she loved it.The cpu is not the most powerful out there but for school work it's more than enough. it's very stylish and at that price point it's one of the best options.
Owned exactly 3 months before it COMPLETELY stopped working. Can't even turn it on!
My son needed a new laptop for school and this was perfect. Runs fast and allows him to browse the internet while at lunch qucker then his old laptop. We are very happy with this purchase!
Not impressed. Doesn't seem to have the horsepower to run windows 10 smoothly. The experience is lackluster at best. For the price point, you would be much better off with a chrome book. Chrome books at this price point perform well.
Looked nice but oh-so-disappointed. By the time we installed all of the updates, there's little to no room for anything else. Would NOT recommend. I can watch Netflix on it... so that's nice I guess.
Not enough memory. I thought if the manufacturer designed it with 32 gb it would work with 32 gb. I don't even need much space beyond the operating system, but this wouldn't let me even install the latest Windows update with the memory that is there.
It's one of the best laptops I've ever owned. I previously had a bigger Asus laptop but became a struggle carrying it to school. I did some research and came across this laptop and instantly purchased it. Great price for this ð». It's very thin and it has a nice feel to it. Totally recommend it!!!
I purchased this laptop for ease of storing and taking when traveling. It was easy to set up, lightweight and meets my expectations. The small 11.6 inch size is perfect and fits in my shoulder bag when traveling.
I have had this notebook since December 2016 and have mixed feelings. I needed an updated operating system, my Toshiba was more than 15 years old, it had the Vista OS and could only be updated to windows 7, I wanted windows 10. I didn't want anything big and thought after reading the reviews this might fit the bill. Well it certainly is small it's taking some getting use to. The key board seem to be cramped and no matter how I adjust it, the mouse pad is jumpy. All in all it's a nice notebook and after much thought, I started to give it to my grand children and get a more traditional laptop. I still might but I am getting use to this so I will see. I just need to remember to adjust from my work computer which is a Lonovo Think Pad.I'm giving it 4 stars because it's as described; portable and lightweight. It has limited memory but you can put in an SD card to add more. It only has 1 USB port but I already had a USB extension so I use that so no issue there. The color is gold and very pretty. It really isn't a bad little notebook. I just need to adjust from bigger to small ha ha.
this computer is elegant looking even if it is made out of plastic instead of aluminum. It looks like a macbook air... and it is really light. I really like the size for school, not a burden to carry around in my backpack at all. It runs swiftly, it does not have a lot of storage space.. but I use onedrive and microsoft and a flashcard program with no problem. Well worth the $200 in my opinion... only issue is a sticky Y key, it does not press well like the other keys.
Good computer. Just really disapointed the number 4 key is sticky and seems almost broken. Might have to exchange/return. Also the color is way off. Not the gold tone in picture. Also found a minor chip. Theres always gonna be something wrong.
Perfect laptop for students. Very very simple. Not as fast as other laptops but it's bearable. There aren't as many usb ports as I like but that's fine. Extremely light weight which is perfect for traveling. Not much memory but that can be fixed with an external hard drive or usb stick. The keyboard is a bit small but it's fine for my small hands.
great little computer I am using it right now I had the 2gb ram dual core and gave it to my mom and upgraded to this 4gb quad core get the 4gb it seems faster I paid $199 so I'm very happy
I will never buy a device with windows 10s again. You can only use this for apps that are offered through the microsoft store. Even browsers are limited to edge. Laptop does work get get online, but that is about it. I would not buy this again.
So I just received mine in the mail today. Upon taking it out the box and getting through the intial install I go to the office program that's supposed to be installed on to the device and click on it. I then receive an error code.Ok... so next I get two system messages saying something went wrong with the drivers and to restart my PC. So I do so and now I'm stuck at the blue Microsoft Windows installation screen.
Great for a student. Super quick, has 12gb free after Windows Google Chrome and Ms office, which it comes with pre downloaded. Nice build quality as always with asus. Overall good choice for $200
Bought this laptop just to have something to work on school papers with around the house. Clearly I canât tote my desktop Mac computer everywhere. I also liked the rose gold color. Works great for what I need it for. The keyboard although small actually is very comfortable. Iâm able to type faster on this thing but my husbandâs laptop that is at least 4 inches bigger.
Cheap plastic housing. Cannot shut Cortana up. Pre loaded with Windows 10s which forces you to either upgrade to Windows Pro or only use the MS Apps in the App store. Complete waste of money.
This is a great little computer for the price. I found it to be running slowly after I installed Windows 10 so I bought a 32MB microchip for it. Now it moves along smartly. I miss having a touchscreen on my little travel computer - but the touch-pad works very well.
Great laptop for the price!
Terrible computer choice! Purchased April 17th, arrived and used by the 25th of April! I used this laptop three times per week to remote into my office!! First they say they can repair it in 7-10 business days! This computer had no damage and was not even 60 days old!! They just want you to mail it back to them with all your information removed, so when you do get the computer back you spend days getting it back on track! By the time all is said and done you might have as well bought a new laptop and started over!Warning do not purchase this laptop !!!Nightmare!
I purchased the ASUS E200HA 11.6 inch in rose gold and received it on 4/28/17. Since, then I have been using it off an on to browse the web and study for my NCLEX with online programing. I like the color look, and weight of the computer; it is very light weight and small enough to carry around. Like many people, I purchased this computer due to the fact, that it was cheap and I needed a computer quickly so that I can begin preparing for an exam. Overall, it is an okay computer, its not super fast, it does not have a touch screen, the power cord is short and it likes to only charge to 96%. Also, you cannot download anything on this computer, since receiving it in the mail, I have had to do a system reboot. Windows immediately started doing updates, and it slowed down the computer, to a point where I could barely open a webpage. Windows has like 6 updates upon immediately turning on this computer; its beyond ridiculous. There is not enough room on the hard drive to save all of these updates and keep the computer running smoothly, so I turned all updates off thanks to the help of a YouTube video. Another thing, this computer has a lot of pre-loaded applications; I'm not sure why, especially, since space is so limited. I took a picture of the menu page with all of the unnecessary applications, there are even more than that and the problem is that you cannot uninstall many of them. The only computer protection that is installed is Windows Defender, I have a McCafee subscription from the previous laptop, but I have chose to just stick to Windows Defender since there is not a lot of space on this computer. I definitely would recommend this computer if you are in a bind and need it to study for exam or complete business. It is very basic and for the price a pretty good deal. It is not perfect by any means, but when you are paying less than $300 for a computer you cannot expect to get a lot of memory, cool features, or a good webcam. All you can hope for is a working screen, key board, office access, and access to the web.ProsLight weightAesthetically appealingAffordableFree Office 365 for a YearConsLimited SpaceCamera Quality is PoorNot a touch screenShort power cord1.44 GHZ could be way fasterUpdated review* I would not recommend purchasing this computer. I purchased the computer in April and it is now July 16, 2017. I went ahead and allowed the computer to update to the new Windows 10 version. It basically took all of the memory, I have added a picture of it below, but the update has caused it to use 23.9GB out of 29.1GB. I will be rolling back the update and saving up to purchase a new computer from Lenovo. This will be my first and last time purchasing an Asus.
I love this laptop! I'm a high school student who needed an affordable and ultra portable laptop. It is small enough to take to school and carry around, but still has a good keyboard! The color is not as gold as the amazon picture makes it out to be. The color is actually closer to a light rose gold.
my full sized laptop died and I needed something for websurfing, skyping, and playing games. This is great!
Very disappointed...since January I stopped using the laptop...it frozen every time my daughter wanted to used it for her homework.
Fantastic computer, would buy it again (just might as i don't like the ASUS C201 i bought, review available there as well). Full Microsoft license with intel chipset and SSD for $200, perfect. Be aware, this computer is used only as a "netbook" for myself. I don't think this computer would handle medium computing loads or multitasking.
Less than a month old, and already recalled for a dangerous battery. I won't buy another until they get their act together.
This is the perfect computer for class. The design is sleek and lightweight which makes it easy to put in a small bag and not weigh you down.Although the computer does not have much memory, it's useful for taking notes, browsing the internet or for work purposes.
Please read the product description. There is absolutely NO memory on the computer. I downloaded google chrome, kindle and one other app and that was all the space available. Speakers were good but that was its only redeemable quality.
Super fast processing and all around amazing laptop for the price. My boyfriend absolutely loves it!
Great laptop for every day use, I'm not a gamer and I don't view a lot of videos on it. I use it mainly for work and accessing the Internet. Reminds me a lot of the Macbook Air I had. Compact, lightweight but capable of doing everything I need it to do. Also, the battery life is amazing. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I've only had it for two weeks so I don't feel I can speak to the durability of it yet.
This is an edit of my original 5-star review, below. I've now had the notebook for just over a year, during which time I used it as my primary laptop. I noticed some flakiness with failure to boot up once or twice, which apparently resolved itself each time, and otherwise didn't notice any real issues. However lately it has been working very slowly, and now it seems to have died for good. It simply will not start up, even though it's getting power. No way to do a hard reboot, as the battery can't be popped out and in again as on most laptops. No install disk, no instruction manual, and unless I take it for repair or delve into its innards myself I can't see what more I can do with it. I can't complain too much, since I only spent $200 on it and it's given decent service until now. But it would cost more than I paid for it to take it for a professional repair, and unless it again spontaneously recovers I suppose I'll have to write it off as a cheap (but cute) piece of junk that cost me, on average, $15/month for its year or so of service. It's mostly the inconvenience of having to scramble to come up with a replacement on short notice that annoys me. I'd still recommend it if it were available for the same price I paid for it, but it looks as though it's doubled in price since I bought it. Pro: great portability. Cons: small screen and no internal disk drive, not dependable. After this and other disappointing QC experiences with ASUS laptops, I'm going back to ACER.Original review: I travel abroad frequently, so it's important to me to have a decent basic laptop to carry with me that doesn't weigh much or take up too much space. All I need it for is email, web surfing, banking, video chatting, and streaming media. For that, this fits the bill on all counts--plus it is the only laptop in its class costing under $200. It's attractive, not hard to type on, and yes, the screen is smaller than my old laptop--but I got used to that quickly. So far I've had no problems with it whatsoever, and would (and have) recommended this laptop to others.
As the advertisement reads. Great laptop for light duty. Not a gamer machine. But can handle many less graphic intense ect. games. Can perform some Graphic editors. Depends on the software. Not the sharpest image. But not bad for the price and for browsing, shopping, reading, and office or school work. Good second computer for traveling light and with small baggage. Also easy on lap. Sitting in bed. Trac pad mouse is very good. Performs well. Looks expensive. Wonderful color. Screen is plastic. So be gentle. But holds up well regardless of the all plastic design. Keyboard is great.
I absolutely love this capable little machine - it is well, well worth $200! I have installed some older and less resource-intensive games, MS Office 2016, iTunes, etc. on it and it runs everything well enough for everyday use. This has replaced a much more expensive and larger laptop - if you need more storage, put an SD card in! The machine came with very, very minimal bloat (I uninstalled Candy Crush and Office 365 and that's it!).* KEYBOARD/TRACKPAD: Utterly *fantastic* for anything even close to this price range and rivals those on machines triple the price. They're both responsive, the keyboard has good key travel and is a delight to type on. Gestures on the trackpad are smooth, mousing is crisp. ASUS got it perfect with this.* SCREEN: Also quite capable as an 11.6" 720p setup. I watched some HD sports, Netflix, and YouTube all without complaint. Picture looks great and you can customize the color profiles if you like it more saturated, etc. Out of the box though - looks great!* BATTERY: *Spectacular!* I can easily get through a full day's casual use with this. 8-10 hours is expected with constant use. The charger is proprietary but reversable. This is a game-changer machine from top to bottom.* POWER: The quad core Intel/4gb RAM combination is great, and often you can't even find Chromebooks at this price range with the same setup. The 32gb EMMC storage, while not SSD, is plenty fast.OVERALL: If you're thinking about a computer in the $200-300 range, look no further. I would recommend this over $400-500 15.6" models all day. If you're considering this particular machine, I could not recommend it highly enough. This is not a "downsize" from a larger, more expensive laptop, but rather an upgrade: you're getting amazing battery life, good performance, and several hundred dollars in your pocket. Why even look at Chromebooks in this price range when you can get a full-featured, non-bloated OS?
Great computer for my kid. Price was right and I've always had good luck with Asus products.
Great laptop. Love it and very please with its super light weight and how well it functions and it has a great design. For simple laptop purposes it's great. I'm a student and wanted a laptop on the go that wouldn't be too heavy in my backpack. Id recommend getting a hard shell case and waterproof case which I brought both on Amazon too for extra protection. I haven't had problems with mine but keep in mind it is a very thin laptop, may be fragile.
I bought this specifically to connect to my tv to stream Hulu and Netflix. I got the 11 inch and it's perfect for my needs. Set up was super easy and fast. The only downside is that I can't use Chrome. But that's a Wnindow's issue, not a ASUS issue.
this laptop has really grown on me. I didn't need a ultra high performance laptop. I needed a simple document writing laptop for school and this has filled that role and more.
arrived on time, booted up windows, went through initial startup (create user account, etc.) and then as soon as i get to the desktop windows has a warning in the notification tray to restart my computer to repair errors on the drive. So after about 1.5hrs of reboots and windows self-repairing, the machine finally booted to windows again and said "you are running low on space, click here to uninstall your old copy of windows". After all that things seemed fine. Booted up the laptop the next day and it again says to repair drive errors. Also although the laptop seems speedy clicking around in windows and opening some basic apps (calculator, ip scanner, etc.) as soon as I open chrome and load a youtube page the things slows to a crawl, scrolling is super choppy, etc. It is not just youtube either, it seems to be anything that is graphics heavy like cnn or fox, theverge.com, vimeo, etc. Not sure if this is due to the "hard drive errors" or is indicative of general performance. Had high hopes to use this to just browse the web but the first impressions on top of the drive errors have ruined it for me. On top of it all my girlfriend took out the recycling the day after it arrived so I no longer have the original box to return it with so i'm stuck with it. Yay!
Does exactly what I needed it to do.
This is a five star product not for its deal only but also for its value. This machine easily holds its own with other computers that are easily 5 or 6 times its price. Buying this computer has made me rethink the computer business on its own. Obviously this doesn't compete with higher end computers, but after using this computer I'm very confident that most people overpay and overspec their computer. This computer and price are ideal for most normal users. Do not spend more than 300 dollars on a computer when there are computers like this out there. It is light has great battery and is perfectly well equipped for media consumption.
Really small, which i love. Light weight which is amazing.Its a bit slower than i expected, but its good for what i need it
Thought this would be a good product for my daughter to use in college. It didn't even work. Would not complete the start up process. Seriously bummed about it.
This is by far the Best Small Size Laptop I brought.Works great especially with the 4G Ram and enough storage of 32GBeverything just works great. No lag.Highly recommended
Computer functions exactly as it should. For the price range, the 5+ hour battery life exceeded expectations. It came with a free upgrade to Windows 10. Note that after upgrade and installing BASIC software (office and not much else), one should not expect more than 5GB to spare on the HDD. I use a 128GB SD card for storage. Slow, but that is the fault of the full HDD and not the specs, which are very decent for $200.All in all, I recomend for office work only, but it is eccellent for those on an extreme budget.
this thing is great. it is very responsive , great display, and the wireless is great.the only thing I didn't like is the storage expansion is with an sd card, that in itself isn't a problemI just wish that when the card was inserted it didn't stick out the side of the laptop.
Not the fastest or most powerful machine, but for the price it gives you a lot. It streams audio and video media pretty well, and the battery life is pretty good. As long as you're not planning to use this to perform intensive tasks, this is a solid budget option.
Windows 10 is a plague on this poor hardwareit is an absolutely terrible experienceupdates take forever to install and they happen every daysome updates take up to 3-4 hours to install when restartingScreen is pretty dim and windows 10 does not scale with the small screen very welleven though this is a 200$ laptop you would probably get a lot better experience out of a 150$ tablet with a 50$ keyboard case or somethingI am pretty sure this laptop was designed to run windows 7 and not 10I am going to try and convert back to windows 7 and see if it is a better overall experience
Best deal ever!!! Wow, 4GB RAM, great battery life AC wifi, latest intel Atom as of rn, nice!
Very good value for $200, add a storage option like a 128gb usb stick and it works wonders, recommended only to handle documents, web-browsing, watch videos and similar simple tasks.
Nice very lightweight laptop. I really like it but only 4 stars because... shell is all black plastic cheap looking-- could have used brushed metal look to reduce finger prints. My main dislike is the memory. 4 is ok but I could have used 6 or 8 minimum and I do basic stuff. I did get and install expanded storage-- 120 GB of SSD drive for really cheap. Otherwise its ok!
It was a gift to my fiancÃ© and she said it was exactly what she wanted and it works perfectly. Thank you
I've run into many issues with this computer. With have to trouble shoot programs, the mouse not working and now certain keys dont work, i wish i brought a chromebook instead. Im looking for a refund
Its very good by the price, but you cannot install linux with all the features working (like sound, touchpad). I hope drivers will be available soon.
I've had to send it back twice to repair a recurring power up problem. I have to pay the shipping there. This is a known issue, but they still sell them and can't seem to figure out a working patch.
For the price itâs fine. Itâs slow and glitchy already, even though I just got it brand new. I only plan on using it for writing and for accessing online textbooks, so it should be fine. If I needed it for much else Iâd definitely return it for something more capable. Very light, small, and pretty though. Not sure if Office was actually included or if it is just connecting through what I already pay for through my outlook account.
Fantastic buy! Recommended by a coworker and def can't complain! Runs fast, super sleek, excellent for light use!
love this lap top its perfect for my college needs love the key broad very excited about the 4GB RAM!!!! \(^_^)/ oh the size is great for travel I school. the price was fair and reasonable for all that it comes with. didn't take long to set up pretty easy going for as getting started this is a winner for a college student on a budget and in need of a lap top. this lap performs great
So happy with this powerhouse of a laptop! It's beautiful and incredibly efficient! Reliable, fast, lightweight... it arrived way sooner than estimated- I am thrilled w this!
If you're looking for a good budget laptop for college, I highly recommend this one. It's very lightweight and portable making it easy to carry around. Sometimes it acts a bit weird but it could be just my WiFi. The color isn't as "gold" as it looks, it's more of a champagne gold. Otherwise, if you're looking for a cheap, good, portable laptop, this ones for you.
Great little machine but I just needed more HD space. Super low weight and unbelieveable battery life.
Bought this laptop to do basic school stuff on it and it canât even do that. I have had this product for 10 MONTHS and it will no longer hold a charge, wants me a do a security update that is to large for the computer. Lastly, amongst everything else, I have to restart my laptop constantly due to the fact the it decides when it wants to connect to the WiFi. This laptop is a piece of shit and wouldnât recommend to anyone.
I bought this for my non-tech savvy parents, and so far they really like it!
I was supposed to get a code for a year free of Microsoft and did not get and no one could help me. My daughter needed this for school.
While I love the size and weight of the laptop, plus the price is amazing. But, the fact is that the amazing wifi advertised was in fact almost completely non functional. I never got a download speed over 5 mpbs, no matter what wifi modem I connected to, and even when other devices on the same net work were getting at least 30 mpbs. Luckily I was able to get a refund for it, but I would be wary.
This little laptop and is great. It's so small and compact but yet gets everything going into need done. The screen is beautiful. The whole thing looks very classy
No other laptop has given me more issues than this one. Constant black screens. I just ended up taking the screws off so I can snap the back cover out to unplug the battery. Wireless constantly goes out.
Great for email and Facebook. My wife likes the size.
Absolutely thrilled with this computer! Does everything I need and a whole lot more..buy one while you can! ð
Wow, was not expecting this. As a bit of a techy, I'm picky when it comes to electronics, especially laptops. If something lags, or is generally not up to my standards, I will not hesitate to return the product. The Asus E200HA runs absolutely incredibly. The 4GBs of RAM really comes in handy, so if you get this laptop, make sure the model has 4GB of RAM. The process is good enough, I say that because the laptop is $199, what more could you ask for. The processor has not shown to make the laptop lag, stutter, or wait for it to catch up, definitely impressed with it. The build quality on this thing is ridiculous. Better made than my thousand dollar HP Envy. The speakers are also not bad, similar to the processor. Overall, this is a TRUE 5 star product. If it's available, get it.
The HD is verrrrry small. Don't use it for a lot of storage, but the size is what I was after. Smaller than the Apple Air, but a little heavier and a mere fraction of the cost.
Great little laptop, ideal for travel. Thank you
It's a good little computer small compact works good on the road as a battery longer than my last one overall I'm happy with
Eight months in, little laptop pleases. This isn't to say it doesn't have it's quirks. Let me get negatives out of the way. Firstly, the touchpad will randomly fail. This can be corrected with a simple reset. One other issue is the WIFI card losing its ability recognize wireless networks. This is also an easy fix. These really are the only drawbacks. They always occur when returning from sleep mode and wouldn't discourage me from buying this laptop again were I in the market. Other minor flaws: The very low volume of this computer's speakers. You're going to want to plug in some headphones even with negligible environmental noise. Also, the storage on this thing is tiny. After eight months of use I have still not filled it. Of course, I am almost exclusively storing text files. You could seriously remedy this with an SD card (for which this has a slot) or a USB thumb drive.Now I'll briefly go over the notable positives of this computer. The battery life, though gradually waning, is great. In the first six months this thing could go for 2-4 days of consistent use without a charge. Eight months later, it needs to be plugged in every 1-3 days. Keep in mind, I constantly use this laptop for writing and surfing the internet. The screen is great. It's nice for watching videos. It's easy on the eyes if you're word processing. They keyboard feels nice and is a pleasure for typing. It's also a nice looking little laptop. The WIFI card works very well and gets a better signal than my more expensive ASUS laptop.In summation, this would be a perfect laptop for writers. It's light and small enough to slip into backpack and for actually typing with the unit on one's lap.
it functions. the speaker, microphone, and headphone jack don't work and i myself as a tech enthusiast couldn't get them functioning (even with a 3 hour call with tech support who did NOT offer to replace or refund. it runs fast and has had no stuttering, but again- when you're stuck to bluetooth only on audio it kinda limits you
All I needed was a laptop that could browse the internet and watch videos. That's it. I do not know what they are talking about when they say that this laptop provides a smooth multimedia experience because this is the slowest, chuggiest, nearly impossible to use laptop that I've ever had the displeasure of using besides ancient 2 inch thick toshibas that someone filled with malware and viruses. This laptop can't even scroll down a product page on Amazon, it can't scroll down comments on tweets, it often struggles to even play a youtube video without pausing ever 2 seconds despite being totally buffered. Whenever I encounter a page with a single picture on it, trying to two finger scroll down with the touch pad results in an incomprehensibly slow delayed response that sees the page take 30+ seconds to try and catch up to the input...SLLLOOOWWWLLLLYY moving in the direction of the swipe. Somehow using the down arrows is faster and more responsive. With fiber internet, this thing seems to take ages to open up a page and even longer for it to become responsive. I've used all kinds of browsers, I've messed with power settings and its not like I've bogged it down because this thing has no room to download anything so nothing has been. You MUST buy any other laptop, I have no idea if I was somehow shipped some kind of tragically flawed version that got dropped on the inspection line, but for this money I would recommend going with just about anything else.
This is a great little computer! I love the smaller size and yet the keyboard is more than big enough.
I purchased this for my daughter to use for college . It is light weight and functions perfectly .
Works very well for my limited use. Like the long battery life.
Very happy with it so far. It may be the best $200 laptop available.
Small compact, gets the job done. Not a fans of this OS but if you are looking for an affordable windows laptop this is perfect.
This a really a quality laptop for the price. It is cloud based, so internal storage is very limited. If you donât have an issue with saving to the cloud, this is a great option. It runs pretty smoothly and set up is super easy, itâs pretty much plug and play if you have an outlook account. Iâll be purchasing another for my mother to use!
Iâve used this computer daily between the office and home for about a year. Iâm usually running google products so I have no problems with limited memory. Itâs small, but thatâs the point.
Actually a very decent little laptop for the price. I tend to use it for internet browsing, typing and very small music downloads. Very light weight, and i haven't had any overheating problems with it since I've had it, which is going on 6 months.
the computer is really slow, almost wanna break this computer be honest. but the design is super cool, slim and portable.
Beyond disappointed. It deserves one star because the amazon delivery driver delivered it on time! I got this computer Saturday evening, last night after I fell asleep just waiting on my âfile explorerâ?to load, I decided that I would return it because itâs been nothing but issues. Nothing loads in under 5 minutes.
Item arrived completely damaged and not usable. The box was fine so it was sent out in this condition. Not sure why anyone would think this is acceptable to sell.
I love this computer!! It keeps a charge great, is super fast and was way better then my old computer. Obviously it's small but that's perfect for me because I carry it to class. I think this is a rest computer for the price however I've only had it had it for about a month so far. Hopefully it holds up long term!
Nice - price wise - but itâs really for people logging onto a network - as basically no hard drive.
Great laptop! Storage might be little but I just bought a 64gb flash drive for use. Would highly recommend this laptop for students school work is very easy to do on this laptop and the size and weight is just perfect! Streaming videos isn't a problem as well, although the screen is a bit glossy, you should use it indoors. Quality product in my opinion!
Really nice machine just don't purchase and think you are getting a $2000 gaming system but for all of my basic (and not so basic) needs it works well.
I have been using this laptop for about two months now and I love it. It's perfect for what I need (having the 1 year of Word really did it for me in the end). The keyboard is small and takes some getting used to, but it's easy once you get the hang of it. Would buy it again in a heart beat.Only draw backs: it's not really gold, it's more light rose gold and the charger plug-in is a little difficult to plug into the laptop itself. Also, it does not come charged so you cannot use it right away. Manual said to let it charge for about 3 hrs before first use.Battery seems to last longer than 7 days, if you don't use it everyday.I purchased a Logitech mouse to go with it from Target and have had no problems. Original mouse I purchased from Amazon (gold Tonor 2.4 Ghz) didn't pair at all with the laptop.
10/10 recommend. Dont ask, just buy it if your ultimate necessities are one highly budget, slim and slick, speed-okay, compact laptop. I will say this is the highest ratio of value and price. trust, go for it, you wont regret.
Have had this laptop for 7 months now. Purchased it mostly to use as note-taking/writing for classes, light browsing, and a light computer to access PDF's of books.About 3 months into owning the laptop, the wi-fi card would need to be disabled/re-enabled in order to connect to wi-fi after starting up (I've already contacted support twice about this, to which they just said "update the driver" even when it already had the latest driver straight from their website).Another issue is the MicroSD card slot is a hit-or-miss too. Being that the notebook only comes with 32gb of storage, most of which is taken up by Windows and it's apps, a SD card is a must in order to be able to have anything on this computer. Sadly, after waking the computer from sleep, the card is not read, or the card is randomly disconnected from the computer, which can be a nuisance if you're viewing a book PDF. Again, I contacted support regarding the issue, and was given the same response of "update the driver."Lastly, the right speaker has stopped functioning, drivers and all already updated and the typical trouble-shooting completed. I've yet to contact support about this issue but seriously do not expect much help from them outside of their usual response as shown above.If I were to do it over again, I wouldn't waste my money on this laptop. Long time ASUS customer, but their products have become extremely low quality and the support given is next to none. Too bad these issues started happening after my return window because Amazon will no longer take it back for a refund, and ASUS only offers a repair/replacement, both of which I am not fond of. What reassurance do I have if the notebook is repaired/replaced but the same problems reoccur, but outside of the 1-year warranty window?
I am left with paying MicroCrap another 200 bucks for Win10 or installing Linux. One star is high.
I can't do practically anything on this computer. Just check mails and google chrome (IF it lets me) I had to give it to my father, who reads news, nothing else.
Cannot recommend. This laptop did not even last seven months. Unable to get it started. It was purchased on March 3rd of this year. Please look for something else so that you too don't get stiffed 7 or 9 or even 9 months down the road.
ASUS E200HA-UB02-GD Portable 11.6-Inch Intel Quad-Core Laptop 4GB RAM 32GB Storage, Windows 10, Aurora Gold.Â - The Chromebook competitor from ASUS is a winner. For under $200, ASUS has created a fairly powerful serious Windows 10 computer. My present workhorse laptop is a Lenovo Ultrabook IdeaPad Yoga 13 with an Intel I-5 chip (1.8 ghz) and this review will compare the two - the Asus is obviously smaller (by about 4 inches screen size) and less than half the weight - so its advantage is obviously where small size and weight is preferable to a bigger screen/keyboard/etc. My Lenovo runs Win 8.1 and the ASUS uses Win 10. I use Classic Shell on both (get it - it's free and lets you customize Win 8 or 10 to resemble XP or Win 7 menus). One note right away - most sellers sell the ASUS with just 2 GB, so stick to Amazon that has 4GB (I think that's really needed to power today's computers at a minimum). Now here's how the ASUS has done:I tried the ASUS with 4 web browsers (hate Edge, but IE11 is buried in there and can be used, and I also loaded Firefox and Chrome which run fine). I'm not a BING fan but switching search engines to Google isn't hard and I recommend that. I tried my old MSN mail dialup program (which is the old paid version of Hotmail) and it, along with Outlook, both did fine with Microsoft based mail. The ASUS came with a free year of Office 365 and that worked fine - I prefer the older versions of Word, etc., but a free year makes this $199 computer an even bigger bargain. I was also able to download my Corel Word Perfect/Office (Version 7) and it ran well too. I was able to open quite a few programs (all of the above) at once, with a total of about 15 separate browser windows open along with the mail and both word processors and the computer handled that. Web surfing and page loading was about as fast on the ASUS as on my Lenovo, a surprise, since the Lenovo is an i5 and the ASUS is a slower Atom chip, albeit a quad-core version. My gut says the ASUS will do fine for those who mainly web surf and do mail and word processing, but serious gamers will not have the power they need. But for a student or office work, this computer is a BARGAIN, and with it selling at a Chromebook price, it's an amazing deal.Two tips: While the touchpad was fine, I like mice, and a wireless mouse was a good addition. Also the computer is very limited on memory (32 GB, of which Windows and Office use much of that), so spend a few bucks and add a 128 GB microSD card (I did) and download files and less used programs there. There is a slot for the card.Plusses: It has a USB3 port and USB2 port, plus an HDMI port and speaker jack. It has a very good responsive keyboard with a great feel. And while the case has lots of plastic, it seems decently sturdy. The display is pretty good for an inexpensive one - not a rival for my Lenovo. The speaker is pretty loud for a small computer. It boots very quickly and setup was easy and fast and intuitive. The charger is very lightweight and it supports a fast charge protocol. I haven't fully hit the battery life because it's good - but going 9 hours didn't totally deplete it. The wifi connection supports a protocol my Lenovo doesn't so some websurfing may be faster than people used to surfing on older but more powerful laptops.Minuses: Another USB port or two would be nice, but it doesn't have but two. And for serious music, you'll want better speakers/headphones. And manual - well - it's a tiny piece of paper, so if you need details surf the internet, but that's typical for computers these days. And while I didn't slow it much on what I ran, true power users need more than the ASUS, but no $200 computer would meet that need.Biggest plus - under $200 - amazing power for that price. Even if you add Amazon's best deal on a memory card and grab a $7 mouse, with shipping you have a $225 deal. Not sure how they make money on it, but it's a steal. The gold color looks classy.
EDIT: I've kicked off the return process after running into a situation where Chrome literally blacks out the screen when running. Means the graphics card simply can't handle it, which is a dealbreaker. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Book from Verizon and it's much more my speed.Because I AM tech savvy - been messing with computers in some form since I was in elementary school - and I'll tell you, this guy is half baked and not for the reasons you think. So let me break down what you might run into and what to do about it. For the record, I bought this simply to run UWP apps - the apps from Microsoft store - and don't plan to put anything else on it because I can remote to what I need.- Won't power on: The very first thing you should do is plug this in. Don't try to power it on. While it does have a bit of a charge, it's not much. It's actually in a cold state, per Lithium battery shipping regs that don't allow fully charged batteries for risk of explosion. If you already tried, just plug it in, leave it alone for an hour, then come back and try with it still plugged in.- Can't activate Windows: I ran into this issue. This manufacturer cut corners by installing Windows 7, then doing the "free" upgrade to Windows 10 over top. The problem is that if you don't activate Windows 7 before doing that, Windows 10 can't be automatically activated. It's easy to fix: you have to go through manual activation. Unfortunately, this wizard is buried and not easy to find:1. go to Google and search for "windows 10 activate via phone" - the very top result should give you instructions. You don't need to do chat, just the phone. It's an automated prompt system. The screen you see will give you a series of numbers.2. Select the option for activating Windows 10. For all other options chose the "other" option which is usually 2. It should then ask you to start entering or reading this series of numbers. Do so, don't hang up yet.3. At the end, click "Enter Confirmation ID". The phone attendant will read you a series of numbers back. You'll type these into the boxes.4. After this it should successfully activate Windows. You can hang up now.- Can't activate Office: This happens if your Windows isn't activated. Do the previous step first, then try again. You also have to have a Windows Live account/Microsoft account, so if you don't have one, create one before trying to do this step. It's because Office is 365, which requires a Microsoft account, not the local install Office, which doesn't.- Slow performance: Mine came with drive corruption, which can affect performance. The previously mentioned upgrade shortcut was likely a culprit here, especially if they didn't power off/on correctly. Your computer may need to be rebooted a few times until it's "happy". Next, turn off drive indexer (in the search box type "indexing options" and select the app), click Modify, and remove every checkbox you see. That tells the indexer to only go against your personal files, not the entire drive, which isn't necessary for searching. Apps are always searchable.- Low drive space: this computer comes with a 32GB drive. By the time Windows finishes and updates, you'll be down to around 15GB. Buy yourself a microSD card from here or wherever; you can get a 128GB one for around $50 or a 64GB one for around $30. You can just leave that plugged into the laptop as a second drive for your files. Also, don't set up the OneDrive until/unless you get a microSD drive, because it'll eat up whatever drive space you do have left.Once you get past all that, the laptop becomes at least usable. Although that's a lot for your layman user to have to think about for something they just paid $200 on. Invest the $800-ish on a Surface Pro 4 with keyboard instead; you get what you pay for, and it'll give you a more solid experience.
Amazing for the price. That said, it's a $250 computer. It has a few display quirks, and navigating by cursor can be a bit tricky because of the location of the ctrl button, but you can't beat the price.
Great laptop for a Student, no issues bought used from amazon warehouse feels like new
Great size. Perfect for my needs. You can even do light video editing. No complaints.
I only use this laptop to write and store .dox papers for school. Ive got about 50 short papers on it, and im outta room :(
Best Laptop you can get < 200$ ........... this is the only one that come with 4 GB ram
Absolutely the worst purchase I have ever made. This laptop is terrible, it is slow and never connects to the internet. DO NOT BUY!
A little smaller than I expected and I had to contact ACER to receive my code for the 1 year free Microsoft Office. Great computer for the price!
I use this as a portable computer to sketch out ideas in Ableton & Illustrator when i'm not on my Mac. I have noticed some slowness when doing what you think is basic stuff in the OS, but my audio software runs fine. I also popped in a 32gb samsung flash for extra space. not necessary, but super helpful.
It's a good laptop overall but needs more storage. Lightweight and easy to port from class to class. 10+hours of battery life to get through a school day.
Not the fastest, but well worth the price. Runs all day on a charge. Added a 128G micro sd.
hasnt let me down yet
Worked for about 2 weeks and has now stopped turning on. What gives?
great small laptop for reading books and light web surfing
Very nice keyboard feel. Not very bright screen. Overall very good computer for the price.
This computer is great when it comes to price to performance. The reason that it doesn't get the fith star from me is because of the display. The viewing angles are just awful thanks to the TM panel. But what more can I ask for at that price. Great computer overall.
The laptop is awesome. Haven't had it long, but I'm going into college in a few months and it seems like the perfect little laptop for a student. Will update.
Too slow for basic functions. Runs on an app operating system. Doesn't even have hot keys (IE using the volume buttons to increase or decrease via the keyboard. Save yourself the frustration and buy something nicer.
I hate this laptop. HATE it. I never write reviews but felt compelled to do it about this piece of junk. And I'm writing this from my phone instead of my laptop, so that, in itself, should tell you a lot.This is my second ASUS laptop, my first one did not work out of the box, so after a few hours with tech support, I was told to send it back for a new placement.My second laptop (the one I am using now) will not connect to my WiFi. We have 10 other devices that connect with no problem. After spending hours troubleshooting, I purchased an Ethernet cable and decided to just call next with the cable to the router. Bought the cable, only to realize there is no Ethernet port on the laptop. So I had to purchase a USB converter to be able to Plug the cable to the laptop. This uses up 1 of the 2 USB ports on the laptop. My wireless mouse uses the other (because the touchpad on this thing is horribly obnoxious.) I have no extra USB ports to charge my phone, plug in my printer, nothing.Ok. So that's enough of a pain in the butt. My laptop doesn't have wireless. My portable computer isn't that portable. Fine.Now, after a few months of use, the power cable, which never fit snugly to begin with, won't work at all. So now, I'm waiting on my purchase of a new power cable. Hopefully that fixes it, or the laptop will be completely useless.I would not recommend this thing to anyone. I should've just lit the money I spent on it on fire and watched it burn. Would've saved me the agrravation of dealing with this thing. Which, as of today, is a very expensive paperweight.The laptop is cute and small. That's about the only positive of this piece of garbage,
arrived on the date I was told and was what I had expected
I really wanted to lime this computer. It was super light and I liked the color. The charging cable was long and it had the basics I needed. My problem started when I began using it for school. I used Word on it and it kept updating and restarting. I was planning on returning it before the 30 day period but my mom who isn't computer savvey wanted it. She didn't use it til last month and it wasn't turning on. The laptop won't turn on at all and it's only been 9 months. I don't think there's a warranty but I will check and hopefully get it fixed.
I actually really like the laptop I had seen a few reviews and liked what id seen,so I ordered it,was delivered quickly,no issues there.very clean looking laptop.i recommend to others,if you prefer windows over apple...
The AC adapter conforms to the Japanese outlet and has a PSE mark.This PC has Windows10S on Redstone 3, not home S-mode nor Pro S-mode. I did upgrade for 10Pro for free.There was no filling in the packing box of the Amazon at all, and the packing box of ASUS was in a state where it could move freely in the packing box of Amazon.
Good for the price! I use just for email and internet browsing.
This little thing is not only beautiful on the outside, but it runs beautifully as well. It's not as gold as it appears in the picture but more of a champagne rose-gold/silver. It's silent, has a great battery life, and lives up to all my expectations. I'm not even concerned about the small amount of storage - a Micro SD card/cloud storage/external hard drive will fix that. If you are looking for a compact, fast little computer for day-to-day web-browsing and word-processing, look no further!
Very responsive and quick for a not too tech savvy senior.
This is such a great deal. I bought this for writing my memoir. It is perfect. It's not super super fast but it's not slow Either. Amazing
LightweightDoes everything I needgreat buy
Still the best value out there. I bought 2 of them. Very satisfied.
super lightweight. silent operation.
Absolutely LOVE this little machine. It is perfect for the everyday, average person, with average computer needs. Except it's SO STYLISH. I LOVE IT!
Perfect for my daughter's college work.
TERRIBLE! The day I finally received this item it froze multiple times I had to force shut it down! Then an blue screen error message and loud buzzing noise continued until I had to force shut down for a 3rd time!! ALL ON THE SAME DAY I OPENED THE BOX! Immediately returning and highly disappointed in this product.
Excellent computer for an everyday use in high school. My son loves it. Does everything it is supposed to do.
works for traveling pc, light and small. plenty power.
All plastic but easy to use and good everyday internet surfer.
This laptop is great for it's price, I got this as a second smaller laptop to take to my classes, and it does a great job for that. I wouldn't use it to run programs like photoshop or anything too extravagant, but it's great for a college student like myself. It's fast, has a good battery life and runs pretty well for a $200 computer. This fits in most of the sleeves you can get for the smaller macbooks.A few problems I have found, sometimes the touchpad goes a little haywire, which has never bothered me too much, but could be irritating to some people. Another issue, the color is great, it's a very pretty muted gold, rather unsaturated, but if you're not super gentle with it like I am, the paint comes off pretty easily, and shows the black plastic underneath which isn't so cute. This could probably be fixed if you're not scared of a little spray paint.
Good for most operations. Just slightly slow but OK for me.
One week in and I am very satisfied with this little laptop. My primary objective for this purchase was to have a small portable laptop that was still powerful enough to do some fairly heavy multitasking between online browsing, streaming and microsoft office. This little machine has been more than sufficient and has actually been able to keep pace a little better than my work issue desktop machine. I find myself building out complicated excel files with ease while having 2-5 webpages and a couple streaming video players open at the same time no problem. I highly recommend this laptop, even more so when you factor in the cost
IT IS SLOW I HAVE FAST INTERNET THE ANTIVIRUS DOES NOT WORK
Fast and perfect for everyday work. Battery over 10hrs.
Bought for my 14yro. Works great for his high school homework.
sold me a messed up computer, wont charge and certain keys are glitchy
got this for my 16 year old daughter for school and she loves it
Yes it did. i got it for my grandson in highschool. He love it . Light weight easy to take where ever.. he said he love it..
Do not buy this. It is so slow.
This review is for the Asus L402WA-EH21 14" laptop.To start off I just wanted to say that I've been researching the low priced laptops for a while and finally decided on this one. Unfrotunately most of the reviews on Amazon are for the smaller screen Asus laptop which is totally different than this one.The first thing i noticed when i got it was that it was not a fan-less design. Even though you could not see any vent holes, you could instantly hear the fan inside the laptop running. THe laptop would get really hot in that section so having it sitting on your lap would not work for an extended perido of time.I tried to like this laptop, however after about a week of use I could not stand it. The battery life was insanely horiblle. At full charge the laptop would show 2 hours and 30 minutes of lifespan. After watching videos online or doing anything that is CPU intensive the battery would drop down to about 85% after about 10-15 minutes of usage and it would show remaining time as 1:40 minutes.Bascially the laptop would only last 2 hours with normal usage - Browsing web, watching youtube etc. That is totally unacceptable. My previous 11" Asus had a battery life of over 8 hours!I ended up returning this laptop and getting one that costs a little bit more ($399) and flips into tablet mode, also made by Asus. Twice as fast, and battery life is about 6 hours and 30 minutes. Go for that one.
Had item for one month and stopped working for no reason! Defective! Very upset
It is insane how slow this computer is. I purchased to replace my chrome book and itâs terrible. If youâre considering this computer, donât do it, get a chrome book instead.
Great little computer. Good picture.
Great for the price. Fast computer and good screen, perfect size for my kid.
You need this in your life
Works just fine. Good buy for 200$.
I am currently not using this much, but I like it so far, still observing. Nice body and quality. It is fast. I hope it last longer :)
It is a notebook. So if you need it to work from home it is not compatible for the systems needed. The laptop works great for college students and/or anyone just doing normal things on a laptop.
This is a nice compact laptop, but the windows system keeps crashing with the blue screen. Each time it says it is loading files and gives you option to reset the software to beginning (which I have tried 3 times unsuccessfully). I hope will be able to return this since it is completely unusable now.
Extremely light- perfect for my use. Amazed by the battery life and how quick it recharges.
Bought the laptop, and despite being brand new I shelved it for one year due to being incredibly slow compared to its brother, Asus' Chromebook C201, a nearly identical computer but with a different, ARM-based CPU. Every time I opened this computer, it took 25 minutes for Windows Update to do its thing before I just gave up, turned it off, and used the Chromebook. Seems like no matter how often I would use it, once a month, once a week, once every few days, it would do the exact same thing.Over the course of a year, I have accumulated maybe 6 hours of use out of it, to make an extremely optimistic estimate. Checked tonight with WinDirStat and Windows is using over 75% of the hard drive space, and wants more than there is space remaining to do its most recent update - thus it cannot update. I only ever installed two (2!) programs on this computer - Google Chrome, and a utility used for tuning vehicle control modules (HPTuner) which is why I needed a Windows laptop in the first place.I have not stored any media nor any files on this computer beyond 1MB worth of control module configurations.This is not a Windows computer. It is a brick. It is a shelf ornament. It is ridiculous. The hardware's probably good, maybe, but I never got a chance to use it. Maybe I'll figure that part out when we install Linux, which seems to be the only way to turn this into a usable computer.Chromebook is fine though, thousands of hours of use and never had to worry about hard drive space.
Very light weigh. Easy to use and navigate. Money well spent
Ok little computer but for the price I think you can get better.
Itâs okay. Responds slow, a little touchy. I have good WiFi but the internet struggles
After reading numerous reviews between this, a comparable Lenovo, and the HP Stream 11, I bought the ASUS.I own both a high-end ASUS desktop machine, and also an early 2016 ASUS UX305 laptop. Both are great machines, and I put them through the grind on a daily basis. That said, I'm not "brand loyal" by any stretch of the imagination.I came to Amazon via a PC Magazine breakdown of the best budget laptops for 2017. I was intentionally looking for a full Windows 10 laptop in the smallest weight and physical size footprint I could get, for the least amount of money. I knew I didn't want a Chromebook, but wanted the cheapest step up from that which I could. The reason for this has to do with some of the places I travel to, both domestically (USA) and internationally. Basically, I wanted something bare bones that I could use Word, Excel, and PowerPoint from, send email, and write blog posts, but that was cheap enough that I wouldn't cry if it was either stolen on a train in Europe (been there, done that) or demolished by a 70-foot drop down a ravine.Even though the specs on this computer are slightly lower than both the Lenovo and HP Stream I was looking at, I opted for this machine based solely on physical size and weight. It's just a smidge under 1kg, and had the smallest physical dimensions.Received it today and immediately went to work on uninstalling the bloatware and disabling as much of the Windows 10 junk as possible. If you are not tech savvy, there are a number of tools that will help you with this process. I personally used the Winaero Tweaker to get rid of most of the Microsoft spyware and other stuff. Despite my dislike of the new Office 365 system, I went ahead and activated the complimentary 1 year Office 365 membership -- a nice perk that would normally cost $70 (thus making this a $130 laptop, if you squint real hard).With a dozen Chrome tabs open, another application installing, and a giant update downloading all at the same time... Sure, it slows to a crawl. But it was tolerable. Mine was manufactured in April 2017 (mfg date is on the sticker on the bottom of the unit), and I doubt I would have been as thrilled with the early 2016 version that only had 2 GB of RAM and a slightly older processor.Sure, the screen ain't the best, and it will grind to a halt if you try doing audio or video editing probably, but that's not what it's for. My ASUS UX305 with an Intel i-5 processor does near real-time video rendering -- this E200HA ain't going to do that, and I would never ask it to (ok, I'm a nerd, so I might try it just for kicks).For the average home user doing basic word processing and web surfing, this machine is perfectly adequate. I'm a "power user" of sorts, and am co-founder of a small tech startup, so know a thing or two about computers even though I'm not an IT professional or "coder". This is the machine I would buy if I had a kid at any grade level, including college. It's the laptop I would buy for my mother if, for some reason, she needed something more powerful than her iPad. This is the laptop that I will take with me in the RV and over to Europe over the next few months and not be too worried about it growing legs or falling overboard into the English Channel.It's a great little piece of technology for $200, and will fit the needs of most American consumers. Dial down your expectations, and you won't be disappointed. If you simply need more horsepower, then I'd suggest looking at the current ASUS line in the $600-$800 price range, because that's what you'll need to spend for far superior performance.
If I could give this computer a 0 I would. It ran rea slow and then just stopped working.... I'm hoping amazon will let me return this piece of junk 20 days after my "window to return".
received yesterday and had some time to play with it. not faced with a single problem yet, it leaves 15gigs empty space for use, i recommend at least 32GB sd card for data storage.
I bought this for my grandson and he absolutely loves it. We had a problem when it froze up. I called Asus and the tech was very help full and walked me through the process to get it back on line. I would definitely recommend this product
it works great! very light and easy to carry around.
Sweet little laptop, operating system works great, long battery life, battery does die quickly in sleep mode. poor storage capacity
What I needed: lightweight, portable, cloud-ish based..but not totally a chromebook, for mainly writing and using research websites/apps...nothing serious, no games, rarely video, 4GB of RAM and an expandable HD.I took a risk and bought this through Amazon Warehouse and it was "used-like new". When it arrived, it looked brand-new - only the box was open. The plug still had the protective plastic cover on it. The aesthetics of this computer are wonderful, the "gold" seems like a light-sensitive metallic, for example under "cool" light, it appears more sliver-gold. Then under "warm" lights, it looks rose gold. Also the brushed texture adds to the metal appearance. The keys have a nice touch, very clicky, although I can't wait until the new wears off. Its crazy lightweight and thin (I'm updating from an old netbook...yeah...a netbook - so this thing is like a spaceship). Performance is pretty standard for what you're getting, luckily the Amazon models come with 4GB of RAM, which helps. However, I agree with other reviewers and get ad-blockers immediately for internet use. Luckily it has a microSD port since the 32GB HD is half taken up by the OS. Its smart to order at least a 64GB microSD card to add some storage.My one-star demotion comes from the issues with the pre-loaded OS (go figure). Everything booted up fine, but the App Store wouldn't work...or any of the associated apps from the store. After some failed troubleshooting and googling, I finally just hit up Microsoft Support Chat. They sent me a link to re-install Microsoft 10. It took forever, but it worked. This makes me wonder if someone bought this computer, had that problem and didn't want to deal, so they returned it. Its all good now.Oh...and Cortana, the assistant...it would be great if you could choose what search engine it uses, but alas, Microsoft handcuffed themselves to bing. If you are real computer savy there maybe a couple of intense work arounds, but for us layman, Microsoft fix the loophole that allowed easy internet extensions to sidetrack bing. So that sucks.Compared to anything else that's not a chromebook for under $200, its by far the nicest looking. If you need a commuter or just something small to type on...this is a steal. If you face the same weird app problem (they just appear grayed out, non-responsive)...just go to the Support Chat.
Sent me a used and damaged product. Also the cursor kept jumping all over the place. The keyboard buttons have good travel but it is very cheap looking and so are the plastic bezels. Screen is good for the price, color is pleasant gold. I don't recommend buying this.
It was working fine at first but a few days later it wouldn't let me login and stayed on the login screen. When I tried to shut it down it said slide down to shut down your PC but wouldn't let me slide down!
Got a 64 GB card to go along with the machine and absolutely love this machine. Looks great, battery time is awesome, keyboard typing experience is good and the trackpad surpasses the quality of many Windows laptops I've used.
I LIKED IT
I bought this laptop for my dad 6 months ago. He never really used it because...well idk. He has a work laptop and thought he wanted a recreational one. But I got it for 200$ and now itâs twice the price. I started using it and it performs very well for the price.
Super slow to start up, freezes on startup screen out of the box, slow in general. Thought it would be decent based on the other reviews.
Excellent laptop good quality. ð
Great for the price! Impressed with the light weight, in pretty good condition, except for a couple small scratches. The storage space is somewhat limited, but I can get more..
the unit works fine, however Windows 10S is a pain. I had to upgrade to Windows Pro to be able to load the software I wanted to.
Such a great computer, it looks very nice with the the gold color that it has and also it is very lightweight and it works very well for me when i browse the web. It is completely worth you're money because it works
Brand new laptop started not turning on one month after I bought it. Had to ship it back twice. They wiped it but should have replaced it and didnât. It was a lemon. You get what you pay for.
I believe this computer was dropped sometime before I received it. Once I activated the battery and opened Windows to use it, there was a thin white vertical line down the middle of the screen. It doesn't interfere with usage, but I am disappointed with it.
I bought it for College and I love it. Itâs lightweight and super cute
Its good for like regular stuff like social media, watching movies etc. When it comes to games it runs but it shouldn't be your first choice, or second. At the end of it all, its a good system for just entering the laptop world would definitely recommend to a first timer.
HiThe battery of the unit died in less than one year. I called Asus support when warranty was expired just by 10 days. The customer representative didn't help me because I was 10 days out of warranty. Not only product was bad but had bad customer experience.
I love this computer.....One of my best purchases.
Very nice...light in weight which is what we wanted
The computer has crapped out on me and I havent even had it for a month. The picture isnt great while viewing videos. All plastic, takes a long time to download apps.
Great computer especially for the money. You really can't go wrong. The only negatives are the amount of hard drive space, but that is easily remedied with use of flash drives, and the speakers are sub par. But depending on what you need it for, those are not necessarily priority elements.It is sleek and light, and does everything I need it to. Great buy.
Looks good; works as advertised. Fast shipping.
Works for me. Compact yet complete
Great if you are business, student or need a cheap PC. This is the best bang $200 can get you. Fast processor and 4 gigs of RAM. It light as heck too so no problem there. 32 GB space is my only rant I'd possibly have at the moment and the webcam looks like a cell phone from 207 but that's normal for laptops.It boots up in about 30 seconds from Power Button to Logging into windows.Charger is 8FT long. Very portable so no complaints there and 2 nice USB ports to accommodate your devices.If you need the following:- portable- fast- quality- powerThis is the BEST $200 YOU CAN GET. Asus is great brand too.
Exactly what I expected. Perfect lightweight laptop. Loaded. Very happy with purchase.
IâmSure this laptop maybe has some features but I just did not see anything. I have already returned it. All around performance out of the box was a 1 out of 10. Pin wheel right away just trying to open the internet window. I donât think budget laptops exist personally
Perfect, light, charge last all day, keyboard is easy to use, size is perfect
problems updating due to low disc spaceWill not boot if even a mouse or empty cable is plugged into the USB port.I will never buy another ASUS again. Maybe AMD tooI'd give this negative stars if I could.
Who sells a computer, calls it Windows but when it comes it's Windows 10S, the "Free" upgrade to Windows Pro doesn't work, there's no Windows certification sticker anywhere and it demands a Product code you don't supply. Of course in the anti-competetive ways of Microsoft you can't install Chrome, Firefox or Java because they are "unverfied Apps". What a bunch of crap this computer might as well be a boat anchor with me stuck with the virus called Microsoft Edge and absolutely no paperwork with a Product code which the last time I checked meant it's not a legal version of Windows. Try to say in your add that new users will have a nightmare of trying to make this a workable computer, what a waste of my time.
very happy with this computer!
An excellent laptop, very light-weight. Highly recommended.
Love It
User friendly. Perfect size for un the go.
Overall it's a pretty good little computer. I like the small size, I can fit it easily in my purse. (I wouldn't describe my purse as small, but its not a huge one either. Just average size.) Good battery life. Nice monitor display. It doesn't have a lot of storage on it, so I would recommend an external hard drive with it. The computer itself also offers the option of uploading saved items to Google so you can retrieve them from any device. Doesn't have a lot of ram either, so it's not the greatest for running multiple programs at once. Ex. I was trying to listen to a video while playing a game of tetris. It got the job done, but it did struggle a bit so definitely not a gaming computer. The video by itself, minus the tetris game, had great playback however. That was Youtube, I haven't tried Netflix yet. It's a light weight, light use, one-thing-at-a-time device, which is all you can really expect from a $200 device. It looks and behaves a lot like a macbook, which is funny when you consider that apple would charge upwards of $1000 for a their version of the product, haha.
I thought I was ordering the laptop in the picture, all black, but what I got was a greyish color with a blue keyboard and was a Chromebook. Not what I ordered, but it seems to work well so far and it also came when I was told I would get it.
This laptop was everything that I was looking for in an affordable notebook. I never usually write reviews, but being able to accomplish all of my daily computing needs at a $200 price point was huge for me. The laptop runs very smoothly, I almost constantly have MS Word, MS Edge, and 6-8 Chrome browsing tabs open without noticing any significant lag. The keyboard is awesome, and the size is compact and extremely portable. I can pull the laptop out and be checking email or editing an assignment within 30 seconds.Positives:-very reasonable price-awesome mobility-good speed for amount of RAM and chip-lightweight laptop and charger-great battery lifeNegatives:-low storage (32 gigs SSD so really about 10-15 gigs post apps) (buy and SDXC card for $40)-probably not great for high media/ video users-has trouble with more intensive programs or online apps (Google Docs, LabView, etc)-touchpad is poor in regards to multi-finger movement (if you are selecting text a mouse is a must)Smart consumers will buy a product that matches their needs. If you are looking for a portable laptop that can complete all daily functions for a good price than this is awesome. If you want to run intensive programs or watch 5 videos simultaneously than your an idiot to search in the $200 price range.
Great meets my needs. Just ordered a largerone.
Needed a laptop for school and this one is perfect. The long battery makes it even better I haven't had to charge it in 3 days
It's a cheap laptop with basic specs, and it does not outperform expectations. Resolution is decent at low brightness; speakers are nothing special; and Windows 10 has shown me that Microsoft has not fixed the issues that plagued its operating systems half a decade ago.
DO NOT BUY!! The whole screen on this computer glitches and barely works after about 3 days and it has no storage on it...not even enouph for a windows 10 update. The computer is also extremely slow and laggy. Not worth $50 bucks imo.
A fast, easy, inexpensive laptop.
it looks nice, the problem is when it updates windows, only about 3.80 GB hard drive will be left, and this is a problem to me, also this laptop is slow, it takes a lot of seconds to respond to simple things like open explorer or google chrome.
Only $200 and you can add a $25 160 gb internal hdd.Upgrading to a better windows os makes it better. The laptop is loud when there is no noise around you but if you're a crowded environment you won't hear it.
Didn't buy it!!!first,came in different color,second,button "volume "on key board stops working after a week ,now screen don t turning on!!!!!
Build Quality isn't the best but what frustrates me is that this laptop advertises that it comes with one free subscription of Office 365 for a year. I received nothing not even a product key? Where can I get this????
Awesome computer!
Its small and sweet
Nice light weight computer with everything we need for limited use. I did put a memory card in it to store photos on. Just right for simple word processing, email, and social networking.
Great for basic needs, very snappy when used properly!
Beautiful laptop! Works great, perfect size, great quality. Love it!
I love the design, it is very lightweight, easy to set up, and very portable for anywhere you go... I love it... the color is a bit off though to me it's more of a rose gold than a gold but that made it better, so overall very happy with this laptop, it will be perfect for school.
Horrible product for any college student. This laptop wonât let you access anything unless itâs in the Microsoft store. There is an option to bypass that but it doesnât work. Will return asap!
This is the most lightweight computer we could find. I love it. I expected a lot of trouble getting used to a smaller keyboard, but haven't noticed much difference. Easy to transport and I am delighted with the purchase.
Not recommended, not even for students use. Slower thank you think
This asus e200ha netbook is great , except the one I got keeps giving error messages,, ordered replacement,,got it in 5 days,, great service amazon
Very fast device and lightweight, it is also very silent. I can hear no sound at all coming from it, I worked at the airport for a long time so it could be that, but definitively it is sound free or almost.Office and Windows work just fine, just activated the feature Find My Device in case of lost or steal.Keyboard is fine, just the right size, it doesn't feel small, and keys are very responsive, I would love to have an illuminated keyboard.Charger size is close to any other cellphone charger, which is really nice and easy to store, not the usual heavy laptop charger.Battery can last for several hours as advised, but that number gets reduced if you use it on maximum performance mode, of course.Something that really disappointing me is the color. It doesn't look gold at all, at normal sight. You have to literally compare it with another laptop that is grey or silver to notice the little (way too little) touch of gold that it has. Thanks Asus for making gold computers, just use deeper tone.----UPDATE----This computer keeps having issues reading my 1 TB Western Digital Drive, it keeps shutting it down. I have change settings for energy, and also on the USB controllers to do not power off the device, but it keeps doing it. The drive is working as usual in my HP work computer and in my Dell Desktop. Such a shame that this little thing is having that issue, I can't really watch anything from my drive because it gets disconnected in like 4 minutes, I have to save things to my documents first, but wait, I also don't have much space.I hope Asus can fix this issue with a driver update, I am an IT tech, and I can use the computer like this, I don't mind, but it shouldn't be like that. One star down.
This is an incredible laptop for the price!!! I'm very happy with this purchase.
its a good computer just that you have to buy apps... i only use the internet
Absolutely love the laptop. I have had no problems with it. Definitely would buy an Asus again.
Bought this for my mama as gift.
Is really easy to instal ssd hard drive
So far so good seems very good computer
Light weight, quick response, overall good price !
The product did not come with the 1-year subscription to Microsoft Office and I do believe the 32GB limits you a lot. Added to that, the USB on the left side stopped working.The battery last long and the designer is super nice though.
Vwry nice
Very lightweight and sleek design. Performance is great also.
NEVER BUY ASUS, IN LESS THAN A YEAR THIS LAPTOP DOES NOT TURNED ON. CUSTOMER SERVICE DOES NOT HELP. DO DIS APPOINTED. I BOUGHT ACER AND STILL WORKING FOR MORE THAN 3YRS
Nothing but trouble, though I so wanted to like it. Even stopped turning on........ Returned. If it were a car, it would be a lemon.
For just $200 it is a great laptop for basic computing and apps. It could be much better if tere was a 64Gb SSD...
The netbook style laptop is near perfect! The screen size, feel of the keyboard, light weight and construction is excellent. It has two USB ports, and mini HDMI out and a micro sd card slot. It gives the illusion that it's alluminum, but it's plastic with a nice finish.Just a couple of small things that I can overlook, but are noticeable. First the touch pad doesn't have separate left and right buttons, it's all one pad. I typically leave my finger on the left click button and use my middle finger to move the mouse around. I found that when I operate it like that, it accesses a "pinch" feature and zooms in and out. The other thing that stood out to me is because it's so slim it makes it difficult to open.Overlooking those 2 small quirks, I love this laptop!
Stil working well
Issue connecting to wifi
These computers are fantastic if you just need one for emailing and light work.
Very low memory descent laptop for surfing internet
Totally Satified Thank you
Purchased this little beauty as gift for someone else, they love it!
Perfect for my music.
3 1/2 months old and it will not start. No screen display and the indicator light says it is fully charged. Bought as a Christmas gift. Very disappointed
Absolutely disappointing. Ordered Used-Like NEW from Amazon Warehouse. The look and feel was good but the bad experience started with the first push of button. The Laptop got stuck between the windows start up screen and boot screen. It started restarting in an infinite loop as soon as the boot was completed. A quick google search showed this problem to be found on all the newer ASUS laptops. I absolutely needed the laptop to work as soon as I got it and ASUS failed my trust. Kudos and full marks to Amazon return process which was very supportive.
I was a little worried about the size, but the screen really is wide enough so as to not hinder the experience. The keyboard is nice. The trackpad is much more responsive than some computers at this price. Overall, good product at a great price.
Slowest machine ever. It's very frustrating to try to surf the internet with just one window open and watch the little circle go 'round and 'round. It has the latest Windows updates. I'm sitting right next to our wifi source where our other laptop flies. Did I say frustrating? I wish I'd returned it in the first 30 days, but didn't.
I teach at university and bought it for my clases. It is exactly what I wanted
Worked out well to have a second laptop for business.
I love this computer ! I've never had a gold one or one this small but it doesn't seem TOO small. I can carry it around with 2 fingers, seems to totally charge up in less than 2 hours. I really like the keyboard. I don't know what it is about it that's different than all the others I've ever used - keys are bigger, closer together ? I dunno, but it's very easy to type on this. It's repackaged or refurbished or something but looks brand new :o) ADDENDUM: LOVE THIS COMPUTER, WHEN IT WORKS ! I USED IT TWICE, EVERYTHING WAS FINE. SHUT IT OFF BY JUST CLOSING THE SCREEN. WHEN I TURNED IT BACK ON, IT WOULDN'T CONNECT. SAID NO WIFI DEVICES PRESENT ON COMPUTER. I REBOOTED, SCANNED, CLICKED EVERYTHING, REBOOTED MODEM ... FINALLY AFTER 2 HOURS, THE RED X ON THE WIRELESS ADAPTER OR SOMETHING WENT AWAY. WORKED A FEW MORE TIMES. I CLOSED IT AGAIN WITHOUT LOGGING OFF, TRIED TO TURN IT ON AGAIN 2 MINUTES LATER, IT WOULDN'T. THIS TIME I SPENT PROBABLY 3 HOURS CLICKING EVERYTHING I COULD, READ EBOOK ONLINE, NOTHING ... HOPFULLY THE SELLER WILL GIVE ME ALL MY MONEY BACK ! IT WAS THE FIRST ASUS AND FIRST USED COMPUTER I'VE EVER BOUGHT, AND THE LAST ! I THOUGHT IT WAS USED, AS IN OPENED AND RETURNED BY SOMEONE ELSE BUT MAYBE NOT ?
I've had mine for about a week and I love it. I needed something small for my classes, because our desks are too small.
Great computer for the money! I love the keyboard - my fingers fly on it!
Love my new laptop! Its actually more of a rose gold then just gold, which im super happy about, but it is misleading in photo. No complaints, perfect for everyday functions.
I ordered this asus as a school/video streaming laptop and it is perfect for just that, I've also had no problem running a few light games, so for the price, can't beat it!
It is lightweight, very thin,and easy to tote. It has microsoft Office, holds all my thousands of photos, and is fast. Synchs with my 15 inch notebook, my galaxy smartphone, and tablets. A nIt cost less than any of them.
This review is for the 11" version, not the 14" option these reviews are bundled with now. The 11" is like a windows version of the Mac Book Air for $200 and is is amazing at that price point if you can find it direct from Amazon. I also have the older 2GB version - I liked it so much I went ahead and bought the 4GB memory one to eliminate the "2GB is a bit tight" when running multiple apps issues. The cases are neatly designed and feel more valuable than the plastic they're made of. I don't abuse them so they've not gotten scratched, but should survive it anyway.The Atom CPU isn't great. The 4GB of memory isn't expandable. The 32GB non-replaceable hard drive is tight. But for $200 you shouldn't care. Buy a 64-256GB EVO microSD card slot for your bulk storage, music, games, movies, etc.I'd love for Asus to make a $499 version with a 1920x1080 touch enabled screen, 4GB and and actual m2 sata slot with a user accessible hatch on the case. No twist/detach-ability needed to keep it this compact.
Kinda slow
I love it - just the hard disk is too small - I had to augment it with an SD card.
windows 10 preloaded is fast , not loaded with bloatware4Gb ram makes it useful for normal browsingtrackpad could have been betterexcellent battery lifeworth the money
I love the form of this machine but the wireless internet is not working and I only get about 2 megs per sec down and upload. I even went to the library this morn to try their internet and it was the same. I wanted to be sure that that it was not my router. There may be settings in the device manager that have to be changed but I have purchased enough laptops that have worked out of the box that I do not want to have to fuss with this. I have four other laptop in my home and the wireless is very speedy. . I could not even download the adobe flash update.There are wonderful reviews and I expect that if the wireless card is ok then all will be well.UpdateFebruary 23, 2017I returned my first laptop and Amazon sent me another. Sadly, the wireless card on this machine also did not work. The download speed varies from 2-10 mgper sec while the upload is the correct 26 megs. I have checked the speed with three different browsers and indifferent homes and the local library. I have updated the driver and changed the settings/options of the particular driver in the device manager.Asus support did respond to my one star review and I did follow their instructions. I have seen many comments on the internet about this particular wireless 802.11A/C and people seem to have problems with the card in their devices. One suggestion was to disable bluetooth since there may be a conflict with the wireless card but this did not help. Another suggestion was to make changes with my router but I must be able to connect to the internet in other locations, not just my home. I have kept the computer for two weeks, investigating and I think that there may just be a flaw with the card rather than the laptop and router settings.Since I like the laptop so much, I will wait several months and try one more time to see if perhaps I can receive a machine that will have a working wireless card.
This is amazingly light and works great.
Good computer for the price, but first time i used it was slow. Just update. Good desing.
This product did not in fact come with Microsoft as stated
This laptop does everything I need so far. Iâll know more in a few weeks when classes start. (Very light weight which is awesome)
Pros:-Good size and weight for transport.-Excelent processor, for multitasking.Cons:-Tried to use a bluetooth mouse, it had too much lag.-Disk space is insuficient to update windows.
Nice computer is perfect for work, really lite, presentable with a perfect sound for his size. Love it.
Great computer. 32 Gb is not so much for Windows 10 however by now (2 weeks) is fast enough running Office 365 (1 one year free already activated) and surfing the web. Recommended
Pleased with purchase
Bad laptop, i bought it and after 3 weeks is not working anymore
Noted slower performance after 6 months
Very pleased.
Met my expectations
I got this for 160 dollars during the Christmas season in the Amazon Warehouse Deals. I understood its limitations but understood what I would use it for. It was for my 9 year old daughter to use to do her arts and crafts youtube stuff so she would stay off my expensive gaming laptop. It boots rather fast, windows 10 works just fine, and it runs youtube, surfs the web, and runs Netflix for the kids just fine. Understand its limitations and you will be just fine, expect more and you will be disappointed. I am extremely happy with it and the price I paid. Great starter laptop.
Normally I don't warn others but here. This computer comes with an awful OS, in the matter of a month updates will eat the small 32GB disk, windows requires for this computer more than 50% of the RAM and processor to itself leaving practically no room for other applications, even the internet browser stalls the computer with two or three pages open, it freezes, it is very slow executing almost everything. How on earth ASUS provides this computer with such a 5hItty OS, anyway there is a solution: I installed Lmint 18.10 and incredibly I discovered that this computer has a powerful hardware, applications run smoothly, the battery lasts for more than 12 hours and powers up in the less than 10s.
Very speedy, it feels very sturdy and made of good materials, I didn't expect to have a good laptop for $200 but this one has impressed me, at the beginning I planned to return it to build a pc but now I'm having second thoughts.
Great college laptop for the price. Battery lasts me at least 2 days of classes and homework before I need to plug it in.
Love it
Use it for school! Works great
Good quality exept it has very horrible batterie life, mine only last about 3 hours
Good alternative for Macbooks. :)
It worked for a short while then quit---I need to take it somewhere for service---don't know what is the matter with it---thanks Terry
Works well. Good battery life. Good monitor.
It works very good, fast and affordable.
I think my phone has more storage capabilities than this thing, but it does what I want it to do, for the most part. I just needed something cheap simple to keep by the bedside or at the coffee table for guests to use. It boots up fast, but the Windows 10 Upgrades are kind of a nightmare to deal with (Slow, freezes, even said it didn't have enough disk space to update). Love the subtle gold color and that it wasn't a cheap-looking metallic gold. It's very tiny, cute, and light weight. Purchased a 32gb microSD for storage like others suggested, and it was kind of difficult to get in, but it works.
Just what I was looking for. I was pleasantly surprised.
More then I expected for the price. Worth every penny I spent. Fast for searching the web and quality screen display. Able to move between screens smoothly without delay.
This computer is advertised as having a "quad core" processor which would seem to imply that at a minimum it is not slow. My experience with this machine for a few months now can best be summed up in one word, "disappointed". This computer is so slow that when using Microsoft Word, Edge, or Outlook, the screen display cannot even keep up with my slow typing. It lags at least a word behind. Very awkward. In addition it is incapable of going more than one level deep into any web site. If there are pages with photos to look through it simply stops and freezes. It has been OK for the purpose I intended which is reading my Kindle books using your Kindle for PC software, although it often takes more that a minute for the program to open. I would not recommend this computer to anyone who has even average speed requirements.
This is a nice, snappy little laptop, good for the few things I need it for, mostly browsing and streaming. If you need to do more intensive activities with a laptop this probably isn't the one for you, but it suits my needs great and has an excellent battery life- if I'm just browsing the internet it can last all day, though streaming video and music drains it faster, which can be said of pretty much any computer anyway.
Nice little computer.
its a solid computer for what it is. only had it for a few moths but it works great
I bought this laptop mainly for traveling so the size was my biggest concern . My main goals are to just use it for basic web browsing and writing documents. I am so far very satisfied with it. The size is great and it is very light, I believe its just under two and a half pounds. The keyboard is smaller than a full sized laptop but it works well enough and the keys have a nice feel. The screen is good enough, the colors are a little washed out but at the price point its no big deal. The track pad is very smooth and responsive. It is powerful enough to play minecraft smoothly if you lower the settings but don't expect to play any games on this machine. One thing I don't like is the charging port is small rectangle, I feel that it is a little flimsy, time will tell how it holds up. Overall I'd recommend this computer for students on a budget or for anyone that needs a light portable laptop to do light tasks. You get a lot for your money with this machine, but we'll see how it holds up in the future.
Works great for the price!!
Bought it for my oldest granddaughter and she loves it.
Everything I needed it to be. Great battery life and great performance online.
Love how it's so lightweight and quick to respond. Great commuter for the price.
I Love It !!! Good Price & Came Right In time Before Finals
Problem with settings will not let us turn on WIFI
Great size
Just what I needed. Lightweight, portable, easypeezy. Added the SD card for additional storage, but that was about all I needed to do. Works great.
Absolutely love it. Got it as a gift for my dad and he loves it. One of the best netbooks currently on the market.
good price and works great and looks good.
I have toyed with tablets since my old IBM thinkpad died, and finally decided to get a small laptop. I had a few reservations, but ordered it on Tuesday the 4th of July. I couldn't believe it got here on the 6th. I charged it, downloaded Office, and played around on it a little. I left it unplugged from Thursday until this evening (Saturday). I have been typing away for an hour or so, downloaded some stuff, and I still have 8 hours left on the battery. I am impressed with the keyboard and the look of the unit.Update: I still have 6+ hours of battery left after leaving it unplugged overnight. I also wanted to comment on how nice it was to get Office pre-installed. the track pad is very sensitive, and although I bought a wireless mouse I haven't felt like I needed it yet.
Cheap but not near enough memory,had to send it back
Very good product
so I've had this laptop for a month or two, and at first I was like I'm gonna return this, its laggy and its not worth my time. now that ive spend more than the 2 weeks I planned, to decide if I want to keep it or not. I'm gonna keep it. it has a lot of pros and especially for $200!!pros:-battery life is amazing! and its charges hella fast, about one hour if that for a full charge!!- keyboard- though it would be awesome if it could be backlit but rather than that its pretty good, it is kind of loud of a keyboard.- performance- though It has a lot to be desired, I really only use this for videos and web browsing, a lot of both. after a couple of updates the laggyness has subsided, though there is a glitch here and there.- trackpad! this is an amazing trackpad!! its fluent and very responsive- weight and size- this laptop is amazing when it comes to its size, asus mastered it. I'm forever gonna be an asus fan!! its so light and ugh Its amazing- amazing build quality for $200. it is all plastic but its a $200 computer, what do you expect!- windows 10- I know its cheesy, like duh it comes with windows 10. windows 10 is amazing!! full apps like Netflix, etc on here! and they run damn good!- wifi is amazing! at a campground where my phone doesn't get good wifi reception, this has 3 bars where my phone has 1 to none!cons:- the screen is good when the screen is anything but straight black, you can see a lot of light bleeding through and its more of a gray/whiteish type of black in the corners. but rather than that its pretty good.- the screen does this weird thing where whites are way over saturated which is an easy fix, but in edge and stuff its not ideal to watch videos, but google chrome doesn't have that problem. thank god lol.- occasional laggyness in any browser rather than edge. when scrolling its very choppy and kind of irritating, but if you use edge for browsing and chrome for vids then its ok, no biggy.- I just did a comparison between chrome and edge ( stock windows browser ), I loaded android authority and chrome took longer to come up than edge, and chrome was laggy in scrolling, while edge had a little lag here and there, but for the most part pretty fluid. and I have like 10 tabs open, so quite awesome!- speakers are kind of a hit and miss, If its on your lap sounds good, kind of muffled. and on a harder surface still hit and miss.-storage but there's a sd card slot. it says up to 64gb, but I'm pretty sure it can be up to 128gb.That's really all the cons! the pros out weigh the cons and honestly its a really good laptop for $200!! I did buy an ssdat first I hated this laptop, but after writing this review I'm extremely happy with it!this computer isn't for gaming, though It is a good option for school. but If I were you I'd pay an extra $250-$300 to get the asus zenbook flip ux360ca for twice the ram, way more storage ( ssd) and it keeps a good battery, better display, and even faster performance. and its light and its a 13.3' display and touchscreen! but for $200 you cant beat the price and the performance! hope this helped!
Love this little thing, it's pretty and even looks like an expensive Mac. The system is pretty basic but runs well. Need some serious external micro SD storage because the operating system takes up most of the hardrive. You can't upgrade or update the internal built in hardrive. It's a great computer for quick easy documents, mild office work. It's awesome for web browsing. Hate windows 10 and refuse to use horrible Microsoft edge. Overall great little machine. Battery life is amazing. NOT good for gaming, heavy use, photo storage, or music storage.
Light and thin but storage is limited. I bought it for my son and he hates it
I love the weight and aesthetics of this device. However, it has required 2 hard reboots in the 4 weeks that I have owned it. This was super annoying but I had to Google how to reboot.
very good
Track Pad defective.
Far exceeded my expectations. Though you must keep in mind that by the time windows updates there won't be to much memory left. The battery lasts FOREVER!
When I got it all of the storage was filled and I couldn't do anything at all.
I purchased the E200HA-UB02-GD as a travel-friendly replacement for my old 15.6" laptop and so far, I love it! It's light and easy to take around in a backpack or even a larger purse. I use this laptop for schoolwork, web browsing, and occasional video streaming. The system runs fine when I have Spotify, 3-4 tabs in Chrome, and MSWord open all at the same time. The HD screen is great, but it look a bit of getting used to since everything shows up smaller. Battery life is excellent, too, all of which is a nice surprise for a machine at this price range.My only (very minor) complaint is that I'd like the maximum screen brightness to be a bit brighter, for when I'm working in really bright rooms. However, this is a very minor issue that doesn't affect day-to-day use.
great product for the right price
Bought for daughter in college. She is very happy with it.
The color on this computer is not very good and it defies changes to make it more vivid in tones.
Love it!
My priority in buying a new computer was portability. I'm an English teacher and teach at several different places, and online, so I wanted something I could throw in either a tote bag or a larger purse that wouldn't be heavy or take up much space. I've been using this for about two weeks and have found it perfectly functional for my needs. I use it to log into my online classes, grade student work (longer essays, discussion boards, etc.), browse the internet, and watch dreary BBC detective shows in bed at night. I am not a "high maintenance" tech -gadget person. If it gets the job done, I'm happy. While it's small, and I probably will never try to write a novel on it, it's fine for what I bought it for. I'm not sure it deserves raves or rants--the speed and memory work fine for me. Time will tell, I suppose, but I am happy with this purchase.
The laptop was very slow and didnât let me download chrome
Good quality. Same as advertised. Enjoying it so far
A bit slow, but works fine.
Came out pretty good I recommended it's easy to use!!â¡â¡â¡â¡ love it
Very, Very slow and terrible performance! Don't buy it.
This computer has Windows 10 S installed, which means that it can only run applications downloaded from the Windows app store. So you can't use the 3rd party internet security software you bought on Amazon, you can't download Chrome or any other browser, and if any other software you love isn't in the Microsoft app store, well, you can't use it. I've spent the better part of the day digging around on the web to figure out why I can't install my software & finally just now found a site that identifies the limits of Win 10 S. I will be returning this computer.
The delivery was on time, the product arrived as advertised. I would recommend this seller and product.
This is an excellent little machine. I kept my eye on it for a while and watched the other reviews - if you're on the fence, and you're looking for an excellently light travel laptop that can run Office while you're on the road without breaking the bank, go for it. I'm impressed with the processing speed and the battery life is ridiculous - I ran all my updates/cleanup/installs of new apps and used it for about 3 hours a day for three days before it hit 20%. Keyboard and screen are decent quality for the price, and it handled all the uninstalling and Windows updating like a champ. Also, this is purely aesthetic, but in some of the other comments there were notes on the color...mine is definitely a light gold, no silver sheen. It looks classy, runs great,, and is so light I don't even know it's in my bag - perfect for long work trips. For the price and specs this is an excellent buy, and I am a happy Asus convert from the super-expensive and cheaply made HP options in this range.
Thanks, very fast notebook
Lightweight and easy to use.
Great laptop
So good !!!!!!good quality
Great little computer. Perfect for school use
A little slow and could definitely use more storage
great laptop!
Great deal and perfect for my husband!!
This piece of crap gets absolutely NO stars from me. I used it 3 times in 2 months and it crashed and now it won't work. Manufacturer wants me to send it in to be fixed. I want my freaking money back! I'm so upset with this purchase! This is money I could have spent on more important things. I bought this laptop to help further my career. HUGE disappointment.
My daughters are enjoying these ..thank you
It's compact, and performance is OK.
Awesome product!
I LOVE IT! As soon as I got it i noticed that the color was not as shiny as I thought it would be but it is still a rose gold color. Really light weight and the keyboard is perfect. Reminds me of a mac design which is perfect. Considering I haven't had it for two weeks it has done a lot of upgrading. Which makes sense because it's new but all it does is update and after all the updates were installed it said my storage was almost full which I did not like. After going through all my apps and deleting a couple things it lowered the storage but not enough; will have to buy more storage because I am a college student but other than that I am really satisfied with the product would buy again.
this worked for about 6 months and just broke and now i've lost all my info not happy
Once d laptop is shot down the correct way it updates itself =no worries so 2thumbs upð
Made a great gift.
Lightweight but very slow.
Love this laptop, perfect size for school or traveling. Fast loading and network.
Hard to connect to the internet. I have to shut off computer to reset all the time, but overall its okay.
Great product!Reasonable price!!
Very good!
This is a terrible product. It died in 5 months! Please don't waste your money on it! Completely unreliable.
I have a great desktop that I love, but when I bought this laptop I needed something small, lightweight, and cheap to take with me on a school trip. This hit all the marks for me. It's absolutely gorgeous, extremely thin and streamlined in design. It turns on very quickly, connects to internet well. The keyboard is also very nice. I had very little trouble typing.The only negative things about this computer are that the trackpad is sometimes funky and unresponsive. The screen is pretty reflective. And of course the lack of storage is a bummer, and if I could have upgraded it to more then it would have been absolutely perfect.If you're looking for something that can handle everyday usage, I would look somewhere else. But for occasional use, this is a great little computer, especially for traveling.
ASUS E200HA Portable Lightweight 11.6-inch Intel Quad-Core Laptop, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage, Windows 10 with 1 Year Microsoft Office 365 SubscriptionTo give a quick intro, I am a college student majoring in computer science. My "main" laptop is big and powerful, yet quite heavy and bulky. I wanted an inexpensive laptop that would be light, small, and somewhat powerful to supplement my main one (the walk across campus seems longer with a heavy laptop).I am very glad I chose to buy this little Asus laptop. Being $200, I didn't expect TOO much out of it, but I was surprised. It is very light. powerful, sturdy, and has a long battery life. I have run into zero problems with this laptop so far and have no complaints. I downloaded Java and two IDEs and ran a test program. Also, the game League of Legends actually runs on this thing! However, the settings need to be tuned to lower the visual quality.I highly recommend this laptop. You get more than what you pay for, and I honestly haven't seen another laptop that competes with this one very well. Most of the $200 laptops currently for sale are simply Chromebooks and/or only have a small amount of RAM. This one simply blows the competition away. Five stars from me!
I am typing this message using the product.
perfect for home use
Exactly what I was looking for and even more than!
great little machine very small hard drive!
Dosent work
Know what you're getting. The SSD makes up a lot for the slower CPU .. You'll want a 128gb micro SD to use for backups.. perhaps even install a few programs on the microSD .. when you receive this laptop you'll have about 10-12gb of usable space.I bought this as my experiment with windows 10; I'm amazed at how well windows 10 handles the lower specs of this machine. I constantly have chrome open with 5-8 tabs (intensive tabs).. One thing you'll have to get past is the first few windows updates which can seem amazingly slow. You have to realize that these first updates are huge - therefore read up on windows disk cleanup (deleting prior version of windows 10) then create back up images using windows 7 backup included with windows 10Pros are the speed of the SSD, windows 10's ability to handle the lower specsTHE BATTERY LIFE IS STUPID awesome. To me it's the redeeming factor of this laptop.Chrome book price with windows 10 and compatible with full windows apps (not just web apps).. overall a great laptop for anything but gaming.
My son loves it
Perfect for a first laptop or School
Very light and worth more than what i pay for.
Powerful little machine for the money!!!
Exactly what I was expecting!
I should mention something I just realized. When you tap the trackpad it is very noisy, a big click sound. So is you are next to someone that could be annoying for them.Good basic travel computer.; Reminds me of my ACER Chromebook. More silver than gold. Light. Had to update windows because some apps did not work initially. Nice size keys. Accidentally resizing the keys because of the touchpad happens more than i would like. Can run Netflix in SD off my home internet. Cannot handle the conversion to HD I guess, the chip is not up to streaming HD fast enough. Ideal for use on an airplane. I have a Mac Air and other laptops but i am paranoid about losing them or having them stolen when travelling so a simple basic computer for work and a little entertainment that is only $200 at risk is great. Can't run multiple intensive programs smoothly, of course. It looks nice. Doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Chrome works OK.It is not worth more than $220 max though. Certainly not $400. You will be frustrated by how slow it is unless you get it at a good price.
Kind of slow
good condition
Great purchase at a great price
Excellent laptop for the value, very fast
I would give it zero stars if I could. My daughter had it for two hours, ran slowly, and eventually, it froze completely, wouldn't even shut off, or respond to any keys. We returned it immediately. I'm really blown away how there are any positive reviews.
works for me
Goog o enjoy it
Slowest computer that I have ever owned. It took all day to set up. They failed to send me the Microsoft office product key, the only fix that the manufacturers and Amazon offered is to return the whole computer. Waiting another week to have today and another day wasted in the future does not sound good to me. That would waste all my product keys for other programs and I would be hoping that the next computer would be sent with the office key next time.Also I do not recommend Windows 10s, it does not let you download any program outside of the Windows app store
Do not buy!!! After my first two days of being on it it, the keyboard stopped working. And, then it got slower. By the time that you buy the ad card your looking at $250 like me. Spend a little more and get the Inspiron 11 2-1! I did and it is worth it!!!
good one
Really light weight, great battery life. Amazing for word processing, coding, or light web browsing on the go. Viewing angles on the TN panel are fairly decent horizontally, However the screen really has to align with you vertically to look its best. Storage can be upgraded somewhat with the micro sd card slot. Performance can be an issue at first and will take some tweaking of running programs to keep load off the cpu.
It is perfect for what I do.
I was a little hesitant to buy a laptop online without trying it out in the store for a million reasons, but figured if I could return it for free, why the hell not give it a go.Pros: Display is nice, seems pretty sturdy, size is really great for students, battery life is good, it has 2 USBs instead of just one like most others, the keyboard has a nice feel to it, the weight is really light, it has bluetoothCons: The mouse is either too responsive and does a weird zoom and/or scroll thing (which i haven't figured out how to disable - I ended up getting a bluetooth one mouse instead), and the hard drive is smaller than I would like it to be.In all, I'm very happy with it. I think the value is definitely there for the money and it's nice to have something so easily portable that doesn't require a full-on computer bag.
Been a great little machine, have had the occasional problem where it'll go off then take a soft reset but it's always been fine and comes back up. I did purchase a 128gb memory card for it and that's been fine for everything I've needed so far. Had it for some time now and it still solid everyday. I use it to surf and shop mostly and my father plays online poker with it. All preform flawlessly, quickly and with ease. To top it all of its adorable, the gold is soft and light and some may perceive it as slightly silver but I assure you it's gold.
Powered this "computer" up it goes through the set up . When I click use express settings it then reboots and goes into an infinite loop of rebooting. I believe the R&D team that created this "computer" secretly wanted to sabotage ASUS because its the most terrible "computer" I have ever owned.
Absolutely phenomenal laptop for a low price. I code on this thing just fine for small simple programs. I got a USB HDD along with it so when I get something big going on it I can save it on the hard drive and run it later on the big machine. It plays Civ 5 like a charm on low settings, and a few other random games mostly pretty 'lowend' stuff(and Dwarf Fortress). Web browsing in chrome can feel sluggish at times, on that note though I feel as if the NIC really does its job well.Pros:- Small sleek design- Pretty awesome battery, I went something like 4 hours one day on Civ 5 without having to plug it in.- good keyboard. tactile, not mushy at all, and well spaced keys.- Low heatNeutral:- The touchpad works, no qualms with it at all.- The screen is all you can really imagine.- The weight is fineCons:- The only real 'con' I can think of is the speakers, but I mean we have headphones nowadays.
The computer is slow and cannot handle many tabs open. I also find the battery does not anywhere near the advertised level.
I bought it for traveling and it died the first time I took it somewhere, leaving me stranded without a way to transfer pictures or make travel arrangements.It would also take forever to read the data card I put in, don't know if that was because it was alreedy defective. Asus screwed me over, lost a customer for the rest of my life. Update-I got it working (apparently they are sensitive to overcharging and you have to hold power button down for over a minute to release extra electricity) but now the installed Windows 10 has outgrown the entire hard drive- that's right- the people at ASUS sold me a computer with an OS that grew to be bigger than the entire drive in less than a year - i bought the computer in February and it already will not hold the OS. Did ASUS not know this would happen? I have to believe they did. And I paid 200 dollars in /February, now they want $400 as of December 2017. What a horrible unethical company that will sell you a computer that won't even hold the OS. When they charged me 200 in February, windows 10 was much smaller, they have to know this computer is worthless at the size Win 10 has grown to, yet they doubled the price. Unethical company, DO NOT BUY!!!!
Purchased as gifts for my daughters. Only had a couple days but they have surfed the web, done a little gaming and word processing with no issues. Live-streamed football game with no issues at all. Impressed with what laptop can do for price point so far.
Nice little laptop for the price, decent for browsing the internet. Unfortunately my needs do not lend themselves well to it. This was my first small screen, and it's just not enough real estate for me.I also just can not deal with the touch pad mouse. It does a terrible job while using 2 fingers. It's got some good thoughts, just poor delivery.This would be a great notebook for a casual web user.
This is a really good computer and its awesome for the price, I was a little skeptical at first but once I got it I was so happy. The memory is not much but once you buy a 128gb SD card you will be good and this is really really good for college students because it includes one year Microsoft Office!!!
I just got my laptop today. This review is for the Asus 11.6 inch 4 RAM Quad-Core.I absolutely love the size and sleekness of the laptop! For the price, it runs amazingly. It's not the fastest computer I've ever worked on but there is no slowness or delay either. Being that this purchase also comes with a year of Microsoft Office included (Microsoft Word, Excel, etc) you can't beat the price. Purchase of that alone is over $100.The color is less gold than it appears in the photo, it's more of a champagne which I was even more pleased with.I work every day on a normal size desktop keyboard at work and this keyboard feels comfortable to me.Also, I tested streaming Netflix and there was no lag and the display looked great!Very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a small laptop for travel and a laptop for basic browsing, emails and spreadsheet and document use!
Great laptop; slim, light, fits in my purse, and is pretty cute. It's cheaply made but I don't care about the looks.Downsides are that it doesn't offer a lot of space and that it does NOT have windows 10....which doesn't make sense. It said I needed to buy Windows 10 and activate it after 30 days of a trial.I guess $60 for buying Windows though still makes this a cheap laptop since I bought it used for $180.
So I bought this because my toshiba laptop that I been having for 4years charger port broke and I didn't feel like fixing it. But guess what "ILL BE FIXING IT". I read reviews prior to getting this laptop I seen some negatives and positives and I went on and got it because there was more positive reviews. LONG STORY SHORT. THE LAPTOP RESPONSE SLOWWWWW, and IT CAME WITH A VIRUS. So I'm returning it !! Disappointed !!
A very good machine for the price. I use it for client notes and my online graduate school work. It does have limited memory but more than competitors at this price. If you work with sensitive data, I suggest getting a thumb drive with encryption instead of using a cloud. Overall, it's worth the price but do get antivirus protection.
This laptop computer was purchased for my daughter to take back to college. Her old one had a cracked screen and she saw this. She loves that it is smaller,more compact than her last.
Great computer! It's not a gaming computer or anything, but for the price and purpose of school it's excellent. Really sleek look, smooth Windows 10 operating system and a free "year" which is apparently October-April? Of office. Better than nothing though. For free it's kind of whatever. Would definitely recommend for students.
Maybe I haven't been lucky with this laptop. Sometimes the cursor would just disappear. When I called a technician, he suggested that I buy a wireless mouse, which I did. However, another problem is that the screen would go black. I leave it alone for a few days and it would start working again. It hasn't been powering on:(
What a great little laptop this ASUS is. It's been a life saver for me when I was away from my main computer, it does all the stuff I need to do to keep my household things in order. I ordered a mouse with it and the work is so much easier with it.
I just received my laptop TODAY and after a few hours the touchpad stopped working. Long story short, there seems to be a known issue with the Asus touchpad after updating to Windows 10. As of this writing, I am trying to get everything downloaded and squared away before finally deciding to return it. (I went online and looked the issue up and there is plenty of help available.) It's a shame if it doesn't work out. Form my little interaction with it so far, I was actually surprised by the screen quality. It's really nice. And the touchpad itself feels like glass when you run your fingers over it. Great looking device. However, I will update with my results.Update: After months of usage I have to say this laptop is UNUSABLE. It has very little memory to be useful for anything - it can't even support Microsoft Windows updates without running out of space. And because Windows won't let users put apps on another drive, the memory is gone. I don't know who thought that customers would be able to use this thing but don't waste your time. There are far too many choices for products out there - find something that actually WORKS.
I got this computer right after my old Lenovo crashed right before my final exams. I'm a college student and was looking for something functional, inexpensive, and durable. This is cheap, but neither durable nor functional for the most part. I've had it for about 4 months and I'm already looking for a replacement. It's incredibly slow for even the most basic things and it has next to no storage space for any apps, documents, programs, photos, etc. I have problems with "blue screens" now - it randomly shuts down and must restart because of an unspecified "problem with my PC." The speakers don't always work and the wireless driver (what allows me to connect to wifi) isn't always recognized so I don't have consistent internet. All in all, a very poorly designed product that is fairly useless.
I love how light it is and portable. My only issue is finding a compatible SD card for it. I don't want to buy the wrong one. I posted a questioned about it but never got a response. I wouldn't recommend it at all as a gaming pc. It's great if you just need to use the internet and/or type documents/papers.
Ah I would not buy it again.I got older one's that work better.I streamlined this one and it is almost full 32GWin 10 takes up too many resources I think or doesn't seem to run as fast and an older one with win 7.
Needed something light and small but able to perform most tasks. The build quality is impressive, performance is OK for this price, sound is surprising, and battery life is amazing. Installed most programs and apps to a 64GB microSD card, and am left with about 13GB free on the C: drive.
I just received this laptop but so far it is exactly what I was looking for. I am mainly using it for work emails and browsing and after setting it up and using it for a day it is working great! If you're looking for a sleek, light weight, and simple computer I would highly recommend this one. The fact that it comes with a year of Microsoft Office is a great perk as well.
Hard drive storage is small...32 gigs....(small?....lol), but I don't need a lot of space. I bought it to write a book, so it'll be fine. It has a micro sad card slot and I found a 512 gigabyte card.(yes, that's 512 GIGABYTES), but I don't really need that much space, so I'll probably use something smaller, and use that somewhere else
Screen leaves something to be desired perfect for a casual user though
I have never written a review before, but I am shocked to see all the extremely good reviews for this product. I had only had the laptop for about 2 days when it began having a problem. When i opened the laptop from sleep mode it was backlit but black. I tried many different ways to wake it up, turn it off, and let the battery die. The problem persisted for a while until I finally was able to bring up the login screen and shut it down not using the power button, but the on screen button. Further, the track pad has the common pinch and zoom capability but constantly zooms in and out when I am just moving the cursor. But the lag on the track pad is also a issue because then I try and correct the zoom but because of the 4 or 5 second lag it ends up overcompensating the other way. As well, the scrolling function of the track pad is horrible. It either jumps 10 pages or moves incredibly slowly. Applications take ages to open and I have not added a single one on here nor anything other than what came on the laptop, so it will only get slower from here. I am absolutely returning. I had the $150 samsung chromebook before this but needed excel. However, that chromebook was far superior to this.
Just got this a few days ago... love it so far. Small, light, good for streaming videos and looking up information from the internet when on the go, or at home. The price is great,Glad got one for myself and my wife.
Just opened mine! So far so good!!! Its really thin and cute. Perfect for a Computer everything major! ððð
I bought this as a gift and they absolutely love it. It's compact enough to take with them on the go.
Very disappointed. Came in with great portability and battery life and good stats for its price. Unfortunately, after about 6 months, it has been crashing continuously. Additionally, it has been having difficulty finding WiFi networks for a while now.
Great size, plenty of speed. My only criticism, so far, is that a couple of the keys have come loose.
First let me say that I spent time trying to find exactly what I was looking for. I was nervous about the restocking fees at Amazon if I wasn't happy with it, so the decision weighed heavy. I have an 11 year old that I was looking for a computer for. I wanted something smaller than a regular laptop so it would be the right size for him. I also, since he is 11, did not want to spend a great deal of money. Funnily enough, I could find many 15.6 inch laptops for around $200, but anything smaller fell into the ones that could twist around and become tablets and such and were therefore crazy expensive. I tried the Lenovo Flex 3, but it only had 2GB of RAM and couldn't even load a webpage without spiking the memory to 100. So i saw this and reminded me of a Netbook. I was never really an anti-netbook person because I knew what they were for and what they weren't. So I bought this and used the Google extensions suggested in another review, and my son has been extremely happy with it. It loads every page he wants and allows him to type papers and such (I am using Google suite to save the limited space this has). Also, the size is perfect for him. So for under $200 with the 4GB of RAM, this has been exactly what I needed. If you want a multiple position one with a touchscreen, then this would not be for you, but still accept nothing short of 4GB of RAM and just know that you will pay more for those features.
Just got this computer and it does not work. opened it up and it loops around and around the same start up page to closing down to starting up.Update two days later - because it is a wharehouse deal - there is no one anyone can do ...
Got this laptop about a week ago. It looks and operates like a much more expensive machine . Don't let the 32gb storage bother you. I installed a 128 GB micro SD card and will add a External DVD ( $30 ) Almost all of my storage is on the cloud anyway .That way most of my devices ,phone etc. can be connected. It is very quick and a nice feeling keyboard . This is a very good bargain . It comes with Office 365 for a year.I will renew for $68 .I would definitely buy again ! This is my second ASUS . When I told my wife I only spent a few hundred $ she rolled her eyes and laughed. It does look like a $600 Device. Isn't a MS Surface but doesn't have a Surface price tag either. Great for travel with good battery life . I recommend it !I am back. have been using this computer constantly. I was a little concerned about the 32gb storage but not anymore. I put a 124 GB Samsung micro sd card in it. Went to storage and selected what Will be sent to the Micro SD card. You can select from 5 categories . new... Apps, Documents, music, photo and videos and new movies and TV shows. But keep in mind, most of my photos, videos, Docs are on the cloud. So I have plenty of storage. The OS took up half of the 32gb but that is not bothersomeIMPORTANT GOOD NEWS! When windows 10 upgrades it will temporarily take up 90% of your CD drive. Don't panic IN 10 days all of the old Windows 10 files will automatically be removed from your C drive leaving you with about 11GB of free space. Justv be sure you put your Docs, Photos Etc on your micro SD card or on the cloud such as DROP BOX (I installed 128GB micro SD card) Between Cloud and SD card I only have windows 10 and apps on my C Drive. This works just fine.
I purchased this as a replacement for an Asus X205TA I got last year, and the performance is AMAZING! What struck me most was the display color difference. Everything is more saturated and sharper with this laptop.I thoroughly enjoy that this is a 4GB compared to the standard 2GB for computers this size. I am a self-confessed tab addict, and the 2GB tends to panic once you go past about 8 tabs. Especially while shopping, being able to open 20 tabs at once is incredibly helpful. Another thing this helps with is the performance on processing-heavy sites such as Shutterfly. My previous computer flat-out refused to do it, while this one doesn't complain at all.I adore the small size, as it allows me to type from a normal keyboard, but gives me essentially the portability of a tablet. I mean, this thing fits in my purse! And as someone with mobility issues, the ridiculously light weight of this computer is wonderful.Pretty much the only negative things I can say about it dare that the little rubber feet on the bottom of Asus 11.6's tend to slide off fairly quickly (about three or four months in), and that you need to transfer your music via USB rather than a direct rip, as they don't have optical drives. It should be fairly obvious that if you're a picture hoarder, you're going to need an external hard drive, but those are much cheaper than they used to be now!For this incredible price, a 4GB 11.6 inch is gonna be impossible to find elsewhere. Grab one while you can!
Great except the small hard drive has now become a problem as I'm unable to update my Windows 10 due to not enough hard drive space. The updater said it needed 8GB free, so I uninstalled MS Office (over 1GB) leaving myself with over 9GB free. But that's still not enough, and the update has failed a few times.
This is the worst laptop that I have ever owned or worked on. Customer Service is non existent. Had to start out by repairing disc error and reinstalling OS. Extremely slow and many times will not load a website. Touch pad is impossible to use. Absolutely useless. The only positive point it looks nice when not in use. If you are thinking about buying it, don't. Wanted to give it no stars but won't let me.
Would give zero stars if I could. I used this computer only about 5 times since I purchased it at the end of July. It has been stored in an air conditioned home under optimal conditions. By the end of September, it already didn't work (won't turn on). ASUS unable to resolve via their support line. They want me to send it in, I just want a refund and to never have to touch another ASUS product again in my life. UNBELIEVABLY dissatisfied with this product. Do. Not. Buy.
Very good results thus far. No issues as yet, I write this review based only on 2hrs of use.
Never reliably starts up right away. I purchased it for one reason, to have a computer to access a work related website that I can only use on a windows computer. Never starts right away, usually takes almost an hour to boot up.
The laptop lasted under a month and one day it just died and didn't turn back on...
When I ordered it, it came in broken. It wouldn't turn on at all. They sent me a new one and it took 10 minutes to load. I couldn't even set it up, because it took too long. I ended up returning it and buying a dell. Even though it was cheap, it wasn't worth it.
This is the worst computer I have ever come in contact with in my life. It freezes everytime I plug in my external hard drive and a minimum of 5x while I'm working.my music constantly freezes, movies freeze. I can't get anything done ever. Unfortunately, I live in Swaziland and I cannot return it and I cannot get another computer out here so I'm stuck. I suggest customers spend a little bit more on anything but this computer.
Very disappointed. There is absolutely NO SPACE on this laptop. Neat and lightweight but I had to buy a memory card. Absolutely no space.
meh, it's a >$200 laptop for light use or work.
When ordering a laptop on Amazon I specifically search for a touch screen.This laptop I received is not touch screen.Wish your search engine work better
my son loves it at medical school
i just started it and already it's slow... what's gonna happen when i put programs and files in it?
Update: I have had good luck so far with the replacement laptop Amazon sent me. I would still hate to be outside my return window with this one though, considering my (and others') experience. I am still not a fan of the emmc storage and soldered RAM. That's just asking for catastrophic failure and/or obsolescence. For now, upping review to three stars.Do NOT buy... This laptop might seem to have decent reviews but it is fatally flawed. The emmc storage (hard drive) WILL fail... It's not a matter of "if," but "when." Asus provides no real support, hopefully you are still within your Amazon return window.
Great seller but not what I wanted. Was under the impression it was touchscreen (showed up in the Amazon touch screen search) but it wasn't. Had to return with no issues.
Arrived fast, no damage to packaging. Took a while to get started and complete all the updates but this is perfect for us!
Speed is not that much as the configuration
This is a cute little laptop but, darn it, I keep trying to reach for the screen to tap or scroll. lol! I'm trying to replace a fried Surface Pro 3. Miss the back lit keyboard. Might need a touchscreen but I love this little princess.
This is one of those "for the price" reviews. Don't order unless you know that this little lappy can meet your needs. If you know it'll work though, it's a slam dunk. I got mine for the price of the 2gb version, and I can't help but wonder if it was a fluke that Asus built some like this. The 4gb RAM makes up a little for the capable, but modest processor. For MS Word, Google Docs, and Adobe Reader use, it's been flawless. It seems like the big website reviews complain about the low-power chips while trying to use multiple video streams and 13 browser tabs. Obviously don't do that. You won't have a problem with basic Netflix though - even though it's not an ideal machine for that (see screen comments below). It's more than capable of non-gaming, non-graphic or video production taks. It also runs an external monitor nicely. That functionality is baked in to the GPU on the Atom chip. It doesn't even flinch.The battery life is what it says on the box. Great. It's like that old flip phone you used to have that you didn't have to charge every day.The only thing I dislike about it is the screen. It's a rather dim TN panel. While I haven't run into any issues with the viewing angles, and I can make it out when I need to, it's still a bit of a letdown. I would have paid another $50 for a nicer panel. Regardless, it meets every need that I have for word processing and research in grad school, and it's cheap, small, and tough enough to throw in my bag on my way out the door. Absolutely would recommend. It's not my only computer, but it would serve in a pinch.Pro tip: keep an eye out for "used" deals from Amazon Warehouse. That's how I got mine without a multi-month wait. Brand new. In a sealed box. Works like a champ.
Light weight than ultrabook and looks good, definitely good option for office productive works.
I purchased this laptopâ?3 months ago and the keyboard stopped working last month.
a good value. A little on startup, but makes a great lightweight travel computer
Good: small, light, price. Not good: downloading the Windows 10 & drivers used up the entire 32Gb SSD right out of the box - even though Windows 10 says it only needs 16Gb on hard drive. Seriously, ASUS & Microsoft?? There is no memory left to load MS Office, or any other software (anti-virus), let alone, run the programs. Yes you could use the cloud-based versions of Office with the monthly subscription fees. But this was a gift for a high school kid, with no means to pay subscriptions. We needed to load Office 2010 (3 Gb) on the hard drive (SSD). It has an SD card slot, but Office doesn't run off an external SD card. With no Gb left on the SSD, it's almost useless as a laptop. Yes we can hire tech support troubleshoot the memory issue, but why should we have to - - It's a NEW laptop!
Its a small laptop. 11.6in is really all one needs for a computer that will do basic projects, word processing, and excel spreadsheets. I would suggest something slightly larger for a person with larger hands. The keyboard is adequate, but slightly cumbersome. Windows 10 is utilized for a touchscreen, and as such should be used with a touchscreen. This is not a touchscreen but provides decent battery life. 4/5 stars. Perfect practicality but much desire left unsatisfied.
Computer was not ready for use. When first plugged in it took 5 hours for updates before I could use it. When I finally logged into it, I realized it arrived with no antivirus software installed and that there was malicious activity in the background. No protection was installed from supplier or disclosed on AMAZON that it was needed.
Stop: lots of reviews have said they had issues with this laptop. 1 it wont charge 2its too small 3 if you send it to get repaired, they charge you the laptop price twice. $400
I was expecting that the computer would arrive with Windows activation code, but it didn't, and when I asked Amazon for support they told me that they were unavailable to give me that kind of support... The promotion of office 365 for a year, it's not true, even tough the computer works ok.
It did not come with a charger to turn on the computer
Not near enough hard drive space
I never got the thing to turn on.
Exactly what I needed: reliable, quick enough, portable and light. No problems so far.
It is a very good mini PC. Fast for web browsing and office operations. It fits my need perfectly, I wanted a light weight device to go meetings and vacations. It is surprisingly quality built with good battery life. Only thing I don't like is that its power plug is not the standard round type, which is bad for an external power pack. I plan to buy another one as spare, before our racist president slaps a 45% tax on imports from China.
it is so small. I though it was a medium size
High quality product. Loved it.
Love this laptop great price
Very fragile. Returned.
Ok, but the price was great.
I'm loving it, It is pretty small and light... it comes with word, excel and all those programs already installed.. Overall it is a good computer,!!
You get what you pay for... It's not great - it's not good - it's OK.I suppose it's good for what you pay for.
Too slow, freezes, and almost no storage.
Works good
The best laptop you can ever buy for $200-250. If you're looking for a good laptop for simple internet surfing or emailing this is the best choice. Also, the great deal for students.
Great product, came as described, very fast shipping
This computer is adorable, but the mousepad stopped working within 20 minutes of using it.
This laptop is everything I want and more! I love the feel of the keys and it's very user friendly. Would recommend to anyone, don't hesitate.
Absolutely. Atrocious. Sound. Ridiculously low sound volume. Basically this laptop does not include speakers. Troubleshooted the sound card and settings on and off for 2 days. The sound quality is just marginally more than a loud phone. NOT on speakerphone... im talking about the volume of noise you can overhear from someone's ear piece when there is a loud talker on the other line. This is not an exaggeration.
Lightweight and works well.
first off it says this has a total of 32G, the one I received only has 29.1G and 29.0G is the operating system...WTF..second I looked everywhere for the mircosoft office 365. its not on here. I cant update because there isn't enough memory. When I tried to use the store app, it says operating system is not configured to run it. I mean what the hell am I suppose to do here. I want my money back not worth it, way to many problems already, its only been 4 days and I'm sick and tired of looking at it. Other than that the computer is gorgeous, mine is just in s***ty condition I guess.
This is the best laptop you can get for its price. Amazing quality and best small laptop. my only problem is that the colors aren't so vibrant BUT this has no other faults at all. Completely worth your money.
It works perfectly
It has not been year and I am having trouble with the laptop, the screen is blank and can't on at all.
Bought this as a Xmas gift. Worked for 20 minutes then died. Won't power up, nothing completely dead. Thought maybe it was in hibernation mode but alas its dead. Will try to get a refund, no desire to get a replacement.
I really like this laptop. It is easy to use and works a lot like an HP Spectre for a lot less money.
Perfect for our use!
Only drawback is memory.
I bought this to hack the Russians and make America great again. Unfortunately I have no idea how to hack, read Russian, or how to make America great again. I thought it was pretty ok already.
I love the product, and the seller was very responsable. Thanks
Smaller then expected.
Have had to call technical support twice since Christmas. Very frustrating.
Good product pity it didn't have a touch screen
Good product a little slow but overall worth.
I just returned this. It looked great, was super light but the track pad just didn't cooperate with me. I also could not get the tablet features to work. It is too bad I wanted it to be perfect. However, Amazon is wonderful and no problems returning.
Won't hold charge and won't pick up wifi. I would like to have someone contact me for a return and replacement.
nice device, using it daily
After reading all the reviews, I thought this would be a good travel computer, but I've encountered a couple of problems after using it for a week. The computer on the second day was stuck on a black screen, after chatting with ASUS over five days, I finally managed to update it. I no longer have issues with the black screen but it does freeze, and constantly gets stuck updating Windows. I don't know if maybe I just recieved a problematic computer or if it's something else everyone has experienced with this laptop. It's not worth the hassle of having to do so much programming with a new computer.
This item stopped working completely yesterday Oct 3rd! I purchased it on july 5th. What a disgrace!0 stars!
Received my laptop today, and it's defective. Returning it and not buying again. Amazon was great is the returning/refunding process though.
Windows 10 sucks, but the computer is great
The "i" key does not work.
sucked only used it for 1 week then it wouldnt turn on properly it went on a loop
Tried turning it on the first time and it got stuck in an infinite restart loop.
It's Good for me. But I can't know power on or not when I press power button.
This is one of the worst computers I have ever had. I bought it 7 months ago and there is some software issue with it that makes it randomly not connect to wifi. When I called for technical support they said it would cost me $100 to check and see if they could fix it or I could buy a manufacturer warranty that cost the same as the stupid computer. Don't waste your time or money
what I expected
My cousin bought it and she likes it!
After 65 days of normal use. The laptop no longer powers on.
Enjoying this tablet, came in in good shape. Great product...
the best cheap laptop 11.6 out there.
Horrible...new pc but didn't work at all
just PERFECT!
Better than Ipads
It's slow, but it's only 200 dollars. It's slow, but it's only 200 dollars. It's slow, but it's only 200 dollars. It's slow, but it's only 200 dollars. It's slow, but it's only 200 dollars. It's slow, but it's only 200 dollars. It's slow, but it's only 200 dollars.Seriously though, it's a little frustrating. I didn't expect a world class PC, but I expected no delays. The touchpad (while sensitive enough) is delayed by the hardware. Everything is delayed. Plan your key strokes and mouse clicks a couple seconds ahead, and for the love of gosh, don't make mistakes, as correcting them takes an eternity. I'm used to a completely equipped mid 2014 MBP, an SDD upgraded Mac Mini, and a completely equipped Lenovo AIO. This sucks. I got it to prepare for the upcoming likely every country laptop ban so I can stuff it in my backpack and not care if TSA steals it, but now I kind of hope TSA steals it. I really only got it to use for mild work when I'm not not supposed to be working for email and remote desktop into my quickbooks server. Remote desktop works pretty ok, because it's realying omn the remote hardware, but man, I don't know if I can do it. Amazon doesn't allow returns of open boxes, but I'd return it if I could.
This computer is a bit slow. The biggest problem is the lack of disk space. I wish it has at least 128 GB but with only 32 GB it is almost useless for everything except really simple tasks.
I'm not quite sure yet what to say about this laptop. My 15-year-old was thrilled to open it on Christmas morning, and for the most part, its been great, but it's been a little quirky and we're hoping things turn out ok.
This laptop is great. It Is super light. My gf love it. 32gb is too little for storage. You can add additional micro sd card to increase the storage space. Battery life is good. 4gb memory works just fine. Intel hd 400 can allow you to play some old classic games. So far i have try red alert 3, call of duty world at war and age of empires 3. All are able to run but dun expect frame rates to be high and the resolution to be fhd. It closer to hd. Won`t make much of a diff on 11.6 screen.
Day 1 - Booted up just fine was excited to get a laptop to just have for writing projects. Couldn't connect to the internet. After a few hours the touch pad buttons didn't work correctly till I restarted the laptop.Day 2 - Same as day one.Day 3 - Same as days 1 and 2 after i shut it down for the day it no longer comes back on.
This computer is a piece of junk. It is not functional. It will not work on the internet, the mouse jumps around, the processor is very slow. I have spent more time waiting for the computer to boot and to down load than actually using it. The Microsoft Edge adds to the problems. I cannot be removed completely. I should have spent a few more dollars and bought something else. I am not out $200 and will have to replace this useless piece of junk.
Christmas present.
I'm sorry Asus, but maybe it's a coincidence, bad luck, or just poor quality of Asus computers, but I've bought two similar Asus touch screen laptops and they both suffered the same fault after several months of use. You wake up one morning and they just won't turn on! And that's the end of it. And because of how affordable (cheap) they are to begin with, it doesn't make alot of financial sense running around trying to get em fixed!
After used 2 days, the laptop black screen. I returned it.
I can buy 6 of these for the price of a Macbook. It isnt a Macbook, but really amazing at this price. The SSD HD is a bit small but if you store everything on the cloud or a thumb drive, you would be fine. The performance is amazingly good. No stalling or latency. and the best thing is that it is lightweight and screen resolution is great at this size. of course it isnt as nice as a Macbook or something at over $1000 but its close in more ways than you expect. The only thing i wish it had was a lit keyboard so its easier to see at night. but wow. and the battery life is great. I am done before its ready to quit. Windows still suck b/c they have frequent updates that take hours. and the user has no say in what goes in and when. If you don't need a workhorse (I use this to remote into my corp desktop since my Mac does not play well with Citrix)
not enough storage, when you start charging the laptop it get stock what are you working on.
I only bought this computer because it was supposedly going to have a one year subscription to Microsoft Office. NO. It doesn't. I am going to return it and never order anything from Amazon or its affiliates again because I have had a lot of time wasted.
Nice little computer, wish it had a higher resolution, I bought it to connect to a projector, and because of its lower resolution it won't full the entire screen. Bummer.
It's slow and one of the keys popped off when I was typing, complicating to put back on so I sent the product back. Pretty disappointed, I needed this for school, a big set back. Sucks I didn't get a good experience like most of the people that bought this product.
I have only used this computer for writing. I hardly ever surf the web and I haven't downloaded a ton of stuff. I bought the warranty to go along with it and it never arrived. I guess I was sold a "lemon" for lack of a better word. It is horrible.
I'm dropping my rating to one star. After 10 months of use the wifi has stopped working. It is not detecting any networks yet there are many.I am going to call the manufacturer for support with the issue.
Laptop arrived dead, it was very slow at the beginning I had to get it up to speed. I complained about it on the product feedback, but the seller didn't even reply to my complaints. That proves bad customer service. I almost send it back but I really like the size, light weight & design so I decided to keep it. The laptop itself looks really nice though, it looks like a $600 MacBook. Nice design Asus.
I expected it to run a little faster. Also keyboard is a little on the small side.
returned it not the screen i was looking for.
First of all,This gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it was $200 and it turns on.I was proud of myself for not buying a "more than I needed" computer closer to the $800-$1000 range.I use this computer for online browsing, playing chess and the occasional streaming.Only program I have installed is Firefox. Computer warns me the memory is almost full.Yet I have Windows 10 software which required at least an intermediate understanding of computer skills and googling to remove (powershell code you can cut and past from online).My old computer is very noisy (fans) and slow. It heats up to the point of almost burning your lap. I still regularly use it because of the pathetic speed of this computer. I don't understand what this computer's intended use is.I suggest spending more money and buying faster processor/more memory.
Seemed fine out of the box. 4 mos later, the mousepad is malfunctioning and I'm forced to use a separate mouse. Laptop is also sensitive to movement and forces itself to shut down randomly; never had this issue with another laptop. It's also not charging properly. Worst laptop I've ever owned
I bought this computer at the end of October 2016 and have only used it a handful of times. I went to use it the other day it it will not turn on. It is fully charged. I don't want to pay to have it fixed.
Locked out on bitlocker and cant find my key to windows. Now I have a useless computer.
I love it!It works great and meets my needs.
SLOW AF
Not very robust, but to be expected at this price.
Overall a very good computer. It gets the job done for very basic web surfing and word processing which is exactly what I bought it for. It comes loaded with windows 10 and has a code for a year of Office included (Note you will be required to register a microsoft account to claim this year of office.) Screen gets the job done but it appears to be a very cheap TN panel and the color on the screen shifts severely depending on the angle you're viewing it at. It's still better than a majority of screens I've seen in this price range.Only complaint lies with the design of the area where my wrists sit below the keyboard. The edges are rather sharp and to compound the issue it's also the area where two pieces of plastic meet. This kinda makes it feel rough. Hope it doesn't cause any long term issues with irritation.
Junk, bought it for my 12 year old son for Christmas. The charger broke almost immediately, ordered another, it broke, ordered another, now the charging port itself is bad. All this in 6 months. Took it to be repaired, but it is one of the few computers that the ports are soldered in instead of plug in, prohibitively expensive to repair
Can't connect to internet. Have been on chat with Verizon and Asus for hours. No resolution.
it lasted 2 weeks. nothing else to say...
No stars! Worst piece of trash. Sorry i bought it. Toy note book.
This computer has been listed in both the bulleted product description and in an image as having an 'all day' 38 WHr battery, which is certainly true of the previous version that I also own. The one that is currently shipping and that I just received, however, came with an 18.75 WHr batter that is already showing 7% battery wear before any use and that is going to provide no more than 7-8 hrs of battery life brand new (dropping thereafter as usual). Clearly as part of cost cutting Asus downgraded this system. MAJOR FAIL. Back it goes....
Did not come with microsoft programs as it said it did >:(
Bad product bought two time and two item have problems
I bought this for my daughter's birthday gift. It didn't connect WiFi at all. Then I exchanged another one and didn't work WiFi either. Disappointed and bought different laptop.
The tiny 28G storage in this laptop makes it so dysfunctional that Windows updates cannot even be done from this point forward. The unit also comes with many unwanted games and the awful Microsoft Edge browser that cannot be deleted or uninstalled. Even though it can never be updated, it still will hound you constantly to update and frequently tries to promote Microsoft products. After a few weeks when it would not even let me restart or shut down the laptop, is when I decided to use the rapidity closing 30 say return option. I think that I learned never to buy a PC product again, and especially one with almost no storage, and only one USB slot. I can't believe that such an awful product can be marketed in 2017. Granted, at $200 the product is dirt cheap, but the dysfunctions noted render it essentially worseless.
I've had to deal with two broken models of this laptop. The first laptop I received was wonderful. It could play older games like Civilization 4 (and could actually even play Call of Duty 4 on low settings with reasonable frame rates), it could do word processing, it was light, fast enough; it seemed like the perfect budget laptop... except that it had a broken SD card slot. Mechanically broken- if I put an SD card in I could not get it out without using a special tool of some sort. So I ordered a replacement. This one wasn't mechanically broken- instead it would have the drive randomly unmount! This would happen completely sporadically and unpredictably. Sometimes it would simply read that there was 0 mb free, sometimes it wouldn't even appear on my PC at all. Two laptops, two broken SD slots! Absolutely unacceptable. Very disappointed.
I have never written a review before, but I feel compelled to since I just completed my return. Like many customers, I purchased this product for it's extremely reasonable price. It was a gift for my wife so that she could use it for school. The box comes and as I go through the set up process, I am unable to connect to my wireless network. After multiple attempts and a call to ASUS customer support, it turns out that this is a hardware issue. I have never purchased any technology that didn't work out of the box. I have zero faith that if I was to receive a new laptop it would come without issue. This will be the last time that I buy an electronic device primarily based on it's price. Anyone considering this laptop should invest a little more money for better quality.
Bought this lap top for my wife and purchased due to price and the size. My first ASUS and you get what you pay for.. I guess it not so much ASUS but Windows 10. It stinks. The track pad is not responsive, it jumps around. Sometimes the cursor/arrow disappears and Windows is always trying to sell you something or direct you MSN or some other Microsoft owned company by way of popups. Very annoying. My Mac Book Air blows it away, but then again, it was four times the price.
So disappointed! Right out of the package I loved the color and light weight, quickly hooked it up to charge and began to set it up. Unfortunately it does not connect to Wi-Fi, I tried troubleshooting and even took it to my school's IT department to get it checked out. They installed the latest drivers and still, it won't even recognize any wifi networks available. I am only left to assume it doesn't have a wireless card, or came with a defective one. I am so upset and returning immediately for my money back. I didn't want to believe all the negative reviews, but I don't want to risk getting another dud (which seems to happen very often with this product), furthermore, I needed this to work right out of the box the first time, as I am leaving the country in the next few weeks and can't wait around to be shipped a replacement that may not even work either.
Smaller than i though it would be
It was working in the first place .
This is a terrible device. For $200 it seems like a good deal but then it's better you light up your money and burn it.Bought this device, used it for less than a week and now it won't power on. Check other reviews and the internet, this is a major problem for this laptop. Now all I have is a piece of junk lying in my living room. I don't think I'm ever buying an Asus device again.
The first day I booted up my laptop, everything was great. Browsed Reddit, checked Facebook, watched YouTube videos, etc. The second day that I used the laptop, the keyboard was being unresponsive. It would just beep at me every time I hit a key. Went on my desktop to look up solutions. Tried uninstalling my keyboard, rebooting the computer, even took the damn thing apart. Nothing worked. Very disappointed considering how well the laptop was working when I first got it.
Rose gold color ....so should specify color
Too much slow
It's work but HDMI not working I had a similar problem with a different Acer product I don't know why this keeps happening
This computer was slow for my needs (web browsing and docs) screen went black and never turned on again after two days of use, returned the product.
not yet like ! look good
VERY DISAPPOINTED!The laptop worked OK for about a month, after that the Mouse Pad stopped responding. I've emailed ASUS and got no response. Seriously ASUS where is the customer service? I'd like to return it or replace but Amazon wouldn't allow.DO NOT BUY, Product may be bad, but customer service seems worse!
I was so excited to get this notebook but after getting yesterday (Jul 5th) I am greatly disappointed. It is NOT a touchscreen even though the details say it is and it won't add my Bluetooth headset. I do not recommend this notebook at all. I feel like I was deceived by false advertising.
Returned it.
Sound card not recognized in Ubuntu 16.10. No solutions yet...
Very small and slow. ..I'm glad I returned it...saw a friend of mine with one she bought on QVC...she was very unhappy with it...
I AM NOT SATISFIED AT ALL. WITH THE LAPTOP AND I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO ASK YOU IF I COULD CHANGE IT. IT HAS PROBLEMS DOWNLOADING SITES AND IN FACT THERE ARE SOME PLACES IN WHICH THE WIFI DOES NOT WORK. ONE OF THEM IS AT HOME. I CHECKED EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO BE CHECKED BUT AT NOT AVAIL. EITHER WITH WIFI OR WITH THE MATTER OF DOWNLOADING IT SAYS "I CANNOT CONNECT' OR STAYS WAITING TO DOWNLOAD FOR EVER. I REALLY SPENT MANY PRECIOUS HOURS TRYING TO FIX IT, SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH IF I COULD CHANGE IT FOR ANOTHER. I AM THINKING IN BUYING ANOTHER A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE AND I COULD PAY YOU THE DIFFERENCE. THANKS VERY MUCH RAMON MIR
It's slow and the touchpad sucks.
Not happy at all!!!
Returned. Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.
I think the star rating for this laptop is skewed a bit because the product page is for 3 different models.I bought the "rose gold" 4GB 11.6" model, and so far I've been really pleased.The 4GB of RAM is crucial to getting the most from the processor. No surprise that a majority of the one star reviews on here are for the 2GB model.All hardware works perfectly, all inputs feel very snug and secure. The only port I haven't tried is the mini HDMI.The full size keyboard is a nice touch. The trackpad material is satisfyingly smooth and responsive. Gestures work great. It can lag a tiny bit if the computer gets bogged down but that happens rarely.No flapping or give on the hinge for the screen, and the surface of the plastic doesn't show fingerprints. The build quality and design of this machine is way beyond the price point.The speakers are very meh. They sound nice and clear but the bass response is absent.Now for the screen: I really want to emphasize that the factory settings for the display don't do it justice. Take the time to calibrate it and fine tune the HD graphics settings and you will be able to get a lot more contrast and vibrancy from the screen. Photos and videos looked much better after some adjustment.This laptop is extremely portable, and though it might not be Macbook Air level thin, it is actually lighter. But the light weight does not keep this from feeling like a quality computer. I did a ton of research on similar laptops with more reviews before I went for this one. I'll update this review if I experience problems in the future, but for $200 this was an excellent purchase.
I love(d) this little sucker! It lasted me 1 years and 1 month before the battery completely pooped out on me (OF course after the warranty). It is so portable and light, and even after a year of falling, a spill, and crumbs falling on it (college laptop), this little guy has been more reliable than my SO's $1,000 laptop. I got this when it was $179.99, and it was a steal. I would repurchase this dude again if I cannot find a battery replacement, but I hope the price comes back down to a reasonable price, $399.99 is WAY too much. Honestly, this is a perfect computer for any commuter or student in the upper years of schooling. It also allows for expandable SD card memory which is a must for a science major like myself. I recommend to every person who passes on this sale, DO IT! I will update if I can find a battery or not!
I bought this for school, as I'm a high school student. It worked OK with Google docs. It's slower than I'm used to (paid $200, what do ya expect). But it did do what I needed if I didn't have another computer accessible.Right now, I have an issue with it not actually finding WiFi. This is probably a one off problem only I'm having, but it's still causing issues regardless. If you need a computer like this, go for it. But I recommend an HP stream or equally-priced chromebook if you want something bigger, and a chromebook if you really only use Google Apps (docs, chrome, etc.)But let's hop in the specifics. It has a front facing camera, USB Ports, micro HDMI and a charging port (not USB-c, if that's what you wanted). The trackpad isn't nice, and neither is the loading speed and stock storage, but it does manage to hold a charge pretty well and it's decent for typing and light streaming for videos. And while it's not metal, it looks beautiful (but does have a few scratches, but I'm rough on everything).And I want to take a scratch second and tell you - it's lightweight. I ride a bike to school, coming in at under 2.5lbs (2.2 if I'm correct) it's perfect as I need something light (a heavier backpack messes up shoulders a bit more when jumping around curbs).Summary: OK for school, not much else. Right now it's a paperweight on my desk while I troubleshoot WiFi issues.I do want to say I bought this with my dad's account, in order to get cheap 2-day shipping. I also want to say I typed this on my cellphone. Sorry!
I can't get on the internet or my email. I am very disappointed right now. And there is no storage space.
About as good as computers were 20 years ago.
The keyboard was too small for me.
i really wanted to love this laptop, but unfortunately it is too slow for everyday use.couldn't even handle youtube and facebook at the same time. im so sad to return this laptop because it's cute, lightweight, amazing battery life, and overall compact. maybe im expecting too much but if a tablet or a phone can run video and web browsing at the same time, i expect the same if not more from a laptop.
ASUS E200HA - I am a Student, Gamer, Tech nerd, and most important Picky. I've owned and built many desktops/laptops in my years of experience. From the low end laptops to the high end I've experienced them all. ASUS has always been one of my favorite brands but I will be completely unbiased for this review. The E200HA is a portable, light weight laptop for the average person. There are hundreds of portable laptops all varying in price, build quality, and components. With a 11.5 inch LCD screen and slim body structure and light weight construction this is the smallest laptop I've ever owned and it takes a lot to get used to, but I purchased this laptop for the soul purpose of having a School laptop that's able to multi-task and run the programs I need which conveniently it comes with Office 365 for free for 1 year which is super helpful.-The keyboard itself is amazing, It's definitely one of the best keyboards out of my laptops for being the size it is. Very satisfying to use, the texture, size of the keys and the overall size of the board it's self is nice-The screen is not as bad as some people have made it seem to be. Obviously people want 4k retina displays, but for what this laptop was designed to be used for it's above it's standards. Watching youtube videos was just like another laptop with Full HD 60 FPS videos-The speakers are quite alright for videos as well, but if you don't use headphones for watching videos anyways where are you?-The track pad is very nice with a responsive feel, the left and right click are responsive and nice to use as well. And most important is the track pad functions are nice also making scrolling, zooming and using other features like Cortana easy. Although I do prefer using my wireless mouse for any laptop I did give this a chance and I would definitely be able to leave my mouse at home knowing I wouldn't hate my life with every second of using this laptop-Web browsing/Multi-tasking is super good for using a Atom processor and only having 1GB of cache. I've had youtube videos playing in the background while being on two amazon web pages, one CPU boss web page, random science web page, and using the Instagram app. On top of that using Microsoft word for my science project about Florida Snakes ;). The only part that was annoying was highlighting, copying and pasting from one website to word. This is probably the most if not more than someone would be doing on this laptop unless you own 3 businesses, run a youtube channel, go to school and like to do random web browsing in your spare time.-Gaming... It plays flash games, Minecraft and a little bit of Counter-strike but at medium to low graphics. And if you happen to get into a big fire fight... Oh boyOver all this laptop is worth all the 200$ I spent and will definitely have this ready for my portable needs.. And even some counter-strike because I'm EDGY
So I ordered one, got through initial setup i.e. Time date language etc then nothing, blank screen, nothing, just stopped working. Amazon was great and sent me a second one right away. Liked the looks and weight so I thought well maybe I just got a bad one. Nope, same exact thing!!! Don't waste your time.
Few days then black screen appear! Can't shut down and odor burn from this. I throw in water and boom! Dangerous. I demend refund!!!
Who am I? I am a girl with small hands (this might be important) who is a college student that has changed studies from a heavy-software-dependent major (arch/design) to a book/textbook/writing-major (PR/econ). So I knew I wanted a laptop that is very lightweight and easy to handle in my hands whenever i have to move from place to place. I never failed to bump my old asus laptop and i loathed the feeling. Besides, almost everywhere you sit in college, desk space is scarce, especially in the classroom or everywhere else you sat that was not the dorm or library. And I hated having my old big screen asus notebook out in the open. So for my new studies, I decided to try a smaller laptop to ease my worries and troubles. It has been a year now and i love it... although i have the old version and my screen does turn black at weird times. (about 10 times so far)Who do i recommend this product to?I am recommending it to my brother who is about to start college with basic classes lined up. I never tried heavy software on this laptop so I am not sure what happens if you install it. I believe it has low capacity to handle the latter. This is for someone who doesn't mind the small screen size and keyboard, and personally, someone who doesn't want a heavy bulky laptop when you depend on writing, maybe reading, internet surfing, quick tasks, basic school-workload. This laptop is the sole definition of portable and you can move it from place to place with the confidence that it will never slip away from your hands. (i recommend getting a case also) It is also fairly responsive. Doesn't take long to load ...that is if you keep it simple.In my college courses, i see lots of students with big-screen computers like macs and hp's. I dont see it necessary when you are taking the classes in the liberal arts, business, core classes, etc. I even know people in the engineering and architecture classes who either want an extra small laptop for its ease or have one already. I've had this laptop for almost a year and when I was still in arch/design school I would only use my old big asus to handle the heavy software and use my small laptop for everything else. All i needed was a USB to connect both laptops with the information i always needed.Now i use my small asus for everything. The price is really nice too.FWI: this is the first review i've written in my life for a product. I just think this computer can really help out anybody whether you are a student, or professional.
I bought this Asus Notebook with the impression that it would have 32GB of storage as it was advertised. Before I have even uploaded all of my pictures from my 32GB phone, the computer storage is COMPLETELY full, with a whopping 10.9GB allotted to "System&Reserved". I would qualify this as being a gross overstatement of this computers specifications. I am thoroughly displeased.
the tablet is full of bugs........and i had to pay an extra $200.00 just to be able to use the thing. I would never buy another computer from amazon.
Before buying this item I thought the positive reviews here were fakes, but I decided to take the risk and bought it.I ordered it with one day shipping and it came before I expected. So far I am pretty satisfied and it runs really fast. If you want to buy it only read all the specs too know well what to expect.I sent it to my girlfriend's house as a gift and they did a good job removing the price and putting a note whit my words on it.Thanks a lot, I would recommend this to a friend and definitely I will buy again
Do not buy this. This ships with a 32Gb EMMC card as the onboard storage, which is no where near enough room to Windows 10 Version release updates. What that practically means is that your computer will waste ~1 hour per day failing updates again and again until you reinstall the OS every 4 - 6 monthes. The computer will not support alternative operating systems that do not have this problem: Major Linux distributions do not currently have Audio Support for this computer, and it will not run Windows 7.Buying this computer guarantees a broken computer every few months.
I purchased this laptop primarily for writing and research and so far I am very pleased with its performance. I installed 128 GB card so it covers all my needs for storage. Excellent portability is another reason I selected this Asus model. You quickly adapt to the size. Keyboard feels great and the battery life is fantastic as stated in many other reviews. Just be clear on what you want your laptop to be able to do and buy accordingly. For the performance I need and the price, this was the right choice for me.
I bought this laptop 3 weeks ago. Battery drains in 12 hours in a normal usage. But do not use Chrome or Firefox and proceed with Edge to surf because Firefox and Chrome use more CPU power. I tested the CPU usage in three browser with you tube 1080p videos and flash animations. Before installing your software, first try to update windows 10, otherwise you cannot find enough space to updating. After you finish the update, close the windows update service and also windows search service then install all your software. Without doing this please do not complain about its speed. By the way it is better to disable windows search and windows update from windows services. Otherwise you cannot use this laptop even for 1 day.
honestly one of the worst pieces of hardware i've ever dealt with, i have had nothing but negative things to say about it. i can throw it farther than i could make any progress with it. it comes with windows 10 optimized for tablets but its not even touch screen. i've only been using this as an oversized coaster recently. spend a little extra for a full sized laptop, you'd be better off than this piece of garbage.
Worst and stupidest laptop. It doesn't let you do anything due to 4 GB memory. You cannot even save your resume or a single super light weight document. It stopped even connecting to the wifi and giving me such hard time. I wasn't able to even buy the microsoft office later and install it due to the small memory it has. I would say NEVER waste your money for this stupid product and the stupid people who made it.I cannot connect to the internet either. This is extremely frustrating and I have been having such a hard time thinking the problem was with my wifi. Until I used my friends' computers and I saw the difference. I would like to return this laptop and get a refund if no one can help me fix the wifi problem.
Amazing little computer. It is small a light weight, a beautiful color and does everything I need it to do. I am a student and this fits great in my purse, it works efficiently and has a responsive keypad and trackpad. I am using it right now to write this review and it gives me no problem. Great if you want to use it for school work and to watch videos and such. It does not have a lot of storage, so if you need space I suggest you purchase an sd card.
I had problems to turn it on since the first time and now it's not turning on at all.
I received this little beauty today. I had read some bad remarks about this computer but I wanted to see for myself. I was amazed how small and.lightweight it was. The sound quality was pretty good . overall this little beauty is a lot of bang for the buck. Just what I need for college. Great deal. Thanks
I used it ounce and it does not work anymore. The screen in black and does not respond.
The color is NOTHING like in the picture. In some lightings it is a faint rose gold, in others almost just silver. Still, it is very light and the keyboard is a comfortable size. Even though it does not appear as it does in the picture, and I cannot figure out how one would go about replacing the battery, I have become very fond of this little notebook and would definitely say it is worth the price.
This is absolute garbage. No storage. Works terribly, overheats and doesn't load pages, which is the purpose of a computer. It was suggested by Amazon representatives as an alternative to a different laptop I'd wanted to buy, which had better specs and was a better quality machine overall but did not ship to my region. The entire experience from purchase to acquisition of this thing was a nightmare. This is nowhere near the same quality or value. I will never purchase anything over Amazon again.
Some of the negative reviews made me think twice about buying, but so far I love it! I use it for school so Word, and PowerPoint are always up and running, and I do random internet browsing. I've had multiple tabs up at the same time and have never experienced any slowness with it. The size makes it very easy to carry around, and the color makes it look very nice, I definitely recommend it!
You can get free Windows 10 S upgrade to Windows 10 Pro..Plus there is a 1Yr free office...pretty good deal!
This computer battery died in the first few months of having it. I have not yet figured out the warranty because I believe there is no warranty. When I unplug the charger from the laptop the whole thing shuts off and won't turn on unless I plug the charger back in. I wouldn't recommend but it's your choice.
It was just working fine the first day but at the second day it wasn't working at all, very dessapointed.
This computer is slow and cheap quality. I am not impressed by its performance and would not recommend to anyone, it battery life also isn't very good and I consistently have to reload my page at least once before being able to stream videos and that's with only one tab open. It did not meet my expectations.
Asus is working as intended. Nice size, easy to setup.
My husband loves this little pc
I would like to review this laptop on my YouTube homepage. My name is Felicia. My YouTube homepage isFeliciastuddard. This laptop is really fast for me.
I have had this laptop seven months and its perfectly fine like brand new. The battery last me a day full of daily usage but not light gaming. I decided after using it that it had some power so i got on to Dota 2 and got 35-40 fps at lowest settings 720p. The laptop ran it just fan but a little warm. The display is better than what you can get from any other brand at this price. This laptop is pretty darn sick. My new laptop would be coming from ASUS. This price point is sick, specs are sick, display is sick, build quality is sick and touchpad, keyboard and speakers are sick all for the price of $200 when I bought this.Good Job ASUS! Also I have a Zenfone 3 Laser and it competes and destroys my brother's iPhone 5s but is right under his 6s performance. This is the 2GB 32GB version I speak of
I think is a really good computer but the only thing I don't like is that sometimes is little slow but other than that it's is an amazing computer for a person like me (college student )
i like it. nice design, very light, good battery (about 12h)...sometimes a bit slow, and camera could be better, but it is great for travel or daily use for students :)
This computer is amazing. Super fast, lightweight, nice color! You just buy a micro sd card and you are good to go!
Died after third use. You get what you pay for I guess
Really like this laptop.. Best thing in Best Price
I love it
Great laptop just needs more memory a sd card is good enough but I want for eemc
producto perfecto!!!
Very very slow computer. Feels cheap. Do not waste your money!
Love the product. Thanks!
You get what you pay for..worse decision I've made..just awful
I'd buy a used MacBook Pro for about the same price instead of this again. It's....so...slow.... and can't even really run iTunes without running out of space. Keep in mind you can't store everything on an external USB slot you put in. I have a 2010 MCB and it runs so much faster and has way more storage than this thing that now just collects dust in my closet.
You will regret purchasing this (or most other) Asus product. Granted that nearly all electronics these days are chinese made but this manufacturer must be near the bottom as far as quality. I bought this laptop shortly before my Asus tablet died so I'm O for 2 with this manufacturer. While they are fully aware of their inadequacies their customer service alarmingly is worse than their build quality (given the low threshold this is remarkable). In both cases the motherboards failed and I suspect their strategy is too avoid repair through attrition. The customer service process is so slow and ineffective that the hours i wasted were not worth the purchase price. You might know the routine, they request documentation and redundant forms but when questioned they have no answers. Reaching a supervisor is like requesting an audience with the pope. Their competitive price was attractive bit as it turns out this laptop was a waste of money and ultimately a bigger waste of time.
This laptop is a total waste of money. It couldnt come on after about 2 months of use. I gave it one star because of the lovely design and color. I totally regret buying.
Just sharing my user experience on Asus quality:I bought Asus Laptop G751JT laptop on June 12, 2016. Just used it for 1.5 year, then in Jan of 2018, the laptop suddenly crashed and could not be rebooted. I sent it to ubreakifix shop in Cupertino, CA, their final diagnosis indicated that it's due to a defect in the mother board. The replacement cost would be $700-$800. Then I called the Asus Support, Case No. N180343075, the guy said the Service Cost alone would be $690. Hope everybody can be aware of my painful user experience and be sure to buy extended warranty if you choose to buy Asus.My $1300 is completed wasted just after 1.5 years.
Terrible Purchase. Returned it after 1 day.
The E200HA has a lot going for it. Good looks, insane battery life, passable performance from a quad core Atom (no longer a curse 4 letter word) for most people with light usage, along with a gorgeous screen. Where it falls down is the RAM limitation of 2GB (Soldered, not upgradable). Nowdays, most modern webpages have so many ad pixels (IE load WSJ.com on this vs any laptop with decent integrated graphics and 4GB RAM) it can cripple a web browsing experience. Storage in this day and age aren't an issue with cloud storage (Office 365 helps a lot here) or expanding with a fast MicroSD but at the end of the day I wanted to love this with its 8-10 hour battery but its just not a very productive device. For $125 a Lenovo X220 with a Core i5 and 8GB of ram used will run circles around it and the battery, CPU, RAM, and several other components are up-gradable or replaceable.. Its just not as sexy or light. I'm ok with that.
I think this laptop is false advertised it is not 4 ram but 2 ram
not good
I bought this for school two years ago and a few months ago the network card quit working so I can't connect to any internet, rendering it useless for my online classes. I've even had computer whizzes look at it and it would cost as much to fix as the laptop itself so I pretty much have to buy a new one. Not worth it to me, maybe I'm crazy but i think computers should last more than a couple years. I also had various issues from the get go with turning it on because the power button is flimsy and sometimes it would take hours just to restart. A few times it would not register that the keyboard was hooked in either making it a huge pain to type and impossible to use the mouse.
Not a good experience soon as the cable left i couldn't get online and closing the page was impossible
I'm a student. I need something to carry around that I won't worry about losing, breaking, or someone stealing. I won't bring my Apple laptop to school due to theft increases lately. On that note, I wanted something for web browsing, typing papers in the library egg chairs and had a keyboard/trackpad combo. I found it.This is not for a poweruser. Don't fool yourselves, people. It's a tablet on steroids. Get that through your head when you purchase and use it. If you have any other expectations like some of the reviewers, well, you're honestly not the target audience. It's meant to be light and cost affordable. Sure, the screen isn't high resolution and it lacks expandable RAM and HD space. That's NOT what this computer is.I've had the computer for a few days now and I love it. It's not super fast by any means; however, it gets the job done in regards to web browsing, finding papers for literature reviews and listening to rdio or Pandora. That's what I need this for. And most likely the average consumer. Face it, most college students buy $1000 Macbooks to look cool. For what? To facebook, stream music, and browse the web. Most people who do photo editing buy the 15" models with maxed out specs (like me). I don't want to bring that to campus. That's too much money to be slinging in my bag to just browse the web.So, let me be clear. This laptop is excellent. The build quality is amazing for the price. Build quality is great of which I was surprised. The keyboard reminds me of the Macbook and the track-pad keeps up with my fast paced motions quite well. It's light and I can have four to five tabs open running different processes at ease. It does like to stutter when I do multiple things with a video running though. Expected for a tablet processor though. It keeps cool and charged for a days use. The front camera is great for chatting.I will admit, this little computer will replace your daily use computer you lug around currently. I used the Chrome Remote Desktop today on campus and was amazed at the speed and ease. I was using my Macbook at home on campus without any hiccups like I experience with Logmein or those other clients. Accessing the 100GB of free storage was as simple as clicking a link. My music, documents and life are on the cloud. I can access them with ease. Printing is no problem for me, either.This little beast will surprise you. Although, please, don't expect the world from this laptop. It's $250, folks.P.S. I typed this from the Chromebook. No problems handling my typing speed. And ask questions if you need them answered.UPDATE 11/24:I've been using this for a good while now and I haven't had any regrets. The computer does what I need, when I want and I only miss running Netflix at school. That's ok though, I have other avenues for watching movies. They do plan on updating and that's a problem with Netflix, not Google. Printing is simple as it seems to be a very common question. To clicks on your computer and you're done. They have been updating the OS and the Chromebook is acting a little better now. Overall, I'm still loving it. Just remember, it's NOT for everyone.UPDATE 02/06/13:I love this computer. It is all I use around campus and for class lectures. I barely use Microsoft Office for my notes or spreadsheets in class. Google Drive and their office version is just awesome. If you do a lot of team-based activities, please, just use Google Drive. Keep your documents available to you at all times and collaboration is simple. It has made my life much easier. Just thought I'd let you all know.UPDATE 04/11/13:Netflix now works!UPDATE 07/10/13:Now that the school season is upon us, I thought I would go ahead and write an update of my handy-dandy little Chromebook. Let's just say, it's still alive and working. Drops, falls, and tosses across the couch and slides across the table this little tabcom is doing well. Software wise, Google has been working at it and getting all the bugs out of the system to provide an even more fluid experience. I love having the ability to use Google Print from ANYWHERE I am and have it waiting for me when I need it. Everything syncs up across platforms and this has really come in hand during projects. Just try the Google Docs as a team compared to Word with Review and you won't go back when doing initial collaboration. Battery is still holding up to 8-10 hours (I know, right)- that's with smart use of the brightness. I honestly don't know what else to say. It works and is the perfect complement for my Macbook that is collecting dust at home. The Macbook is used via my Google Remote Connection and it's just wonderful. No lag or anything like I've had with LogMeIn and the other one. And like always, ask questions if you have them. And I almost forgot to add that Spotify works in the browser just as well as the PC version. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon streaming does work contrary to the other review posted saying the opposite. Cheers!FINAL UPDATE:The Chromebook is an excellent computer for those looking for something light. It won't do everything a full laptop will do and there are privacy concerns of the all-mighty Google. The question to ask yourself though is if you are really secure online? You can get a better laptop as some commentators have stated and that is very true. You can get a nice, heavy computer to carry around and worry about. This Chromebook offers you peace of mind that you can throw it around and not worry about it being stolen (as long as you have a good password on your Google account). It works for me and I'm sure it works for the MAJORITY of others. I've had it for nearly a year and it is only getting faster, not slower. I hope you will take the time to see if it works for you. If not, we live in a world full of other gadgets and tools to fit our lives. I will be removing myself from the comments as there has been a strong output of support from other owners. Live long and prosper!
First off, I am an admitted IT Geek. I have a computer science degree and have spent my entire career working in IT on everything from mainframes to wearable computers. I really know computers inside and out. I want to provide some perspective about the Chromebook by a person who spends 10-12 hours on some type of computing device every day.So why would I ever buy a device like this? Well, I ordered the Chromebook to evaluate it for my parents. They are not tech savvy at all. They have a Kindle Fire and an iPad, but when they do write e-mails and want to do other tasks, the pads are just not enough. They are computer users and media consumption people. What I found out during my work with the Chromebook is that it is the right computer for me too. Now, off to the review...First off the Google Chromebook is computer unlike anything coming from the minds of Apple or Microsoft. Something on the surface that an IT Geek like me probably wouldn't like. It doesn't have a full-blown operating system like OSX nor is it a mobile platform like Android. It is something in between, it is ChromeOS. It is very fast, very reliable, and is perfect for doing your everyday tasks. If you mostly read e-mail, write notes, run spreadsheets, develop presentations, chat, Facebook, and surf, you should read on.The Samsung Chromebook is very sleek, thin, and light. It is somewhat similar in form to a Macbook Air, but it's also close to a number of the new Ultrabooks. The feel in hand is very solid and doesn't seem like a $249 computer. The keyboard is very good; very solid feel and great action. If you type quickly (100+ wpm), you'll be happy to know this keyboard can keep up with you. The only better keyboard I've used in recent memory is the Air, but it's not far off.When you open the box and lift the lid it automatically starts up in under 10 seconds. This is not coming up from sleep mode. That's its boot time from a cold start. The setup process is as painless as it can be. Attach it to your wireless network and if you have a gmail account, just login and you are done. I up and reading e-mail in my account in less than 5 minutes. The last out of the box Windows experience took nearly an hour before I was through all of the setup questions, patches, and add-ons.Now that you are logged in, the simplicity of the system reveals itself. Effectively the entire Chromebook is a dedicated Chrome browser. Almost everything you do is in a Chrome browser window. There are applications included and that can be installed, but they all run inside of the Chrome framework. It is a new way to think about computing. And boy is it fast.About the speed: Wow is the best way to describe it. I dare you to find a browser that is as responsive as the Chrome broswer on ChromeOS. All running on a tiny little ARM processor. This tiny little ARM processor is what gives the Chromebook its 7+ hour run time on a single charge. In practice a lot of this depends on what you are doing. If you want to stream 7 hours of YouTube videos, you're probably going to be disappointed, but for practical all-day off the charger use, I'm seeing that performance easily. It also charges like lightening, so if you throw it on the charger for an hour at lunch, you won't need to worry about it into the evening.Back to why I am keeping the Samsung Chromebook. The device does what I need to do 95% of the time during my work day and 99% for the rest of my life. All of this in a very sleek, inexpensive, and portable package. I still have my work computer, a Lenovo i7 based monster, but it is huge, heavy, and doesn't have nearly the battery life or portability of the Chromebook. I now leave that laptop in the docking station on my desk and carry around the Chromebook and that is the computer I take home. I suppose if I was still spending the majority of my time writing C# I would need a different tool, but the Chromebook is the right tool for me.Pros and Cons?This introduces an interesting point of view. What can we really compare the Chromebook to? There is nothing else that is in it's class, so I guess I'll focus primarily on functionality.Pros:-Inexpensive (I didn't say cheap)-Light-Fast-All Google-Centric (this can also be a Con)-Very simple to setup and use-Long battery life-Good build quality-Good keyboard-Good library of add-on applications (yes, another app store)-Everything for one price (Hardware, Operating System, Storage, Office Applications)Cons:-Not a full-blown operating system-Doesn't run Mac, iOS, Windows, or Android applications...none of them, it can't-All Google-Centric (this can also be a Pro)-Some apps you know and love aren't available yet, maybe never (Netflix is one)-Not as mainstream as either full-blown computer platforms or mobile platformsI gave the Samsung Chromebook 4 stars because it's really good, but not perfect. Bottom line, this is a new device that lives somewhere between tablets and full-blown traditional computers. It is a great consumption device with a full keyboard for doing some serious work (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, e-mail, and web-based applications). I recommend that you give it a shot, I think you'll really like it.
Received today and has a terrible fan noise. I also hear some electrical noise as others mentioned but the fan noise is really loud. It seems that the fan is rubbing against some internal part as when I press certain keys it even slows down.
The first one I ordered made horrible squeaking electrical noises from inside the chasis, which got louder when the laptop was working harder. No, it was not fan noise, it was electrical noise (coil whine I believe) and very noticeable in a quiet room. Returned this one and ordered a second one - hopefully it will not be defective - I'll update my review when I receive it.Other than the electrical noise defect I am very excited about this laptop. I also have the ASUS UX330UA which is very nice, and compared to that one the UX430UA is slightly heavier and slightly thicker, almost unnoticeable. Feels very solid holding it. Both keyboards unfortunately place the power button where the "delete" key should traditionally be, so I've made the mistake of turning off my machine accidentally while deleting photos... watch out for that. Keys feel great to type on, and backlight is super helpful.***UPDATE 12-7-2017I received my 2nd unit today after returning the 1st one, and IT HAS THE SAME ISSUE ONLY LOUDER & WORSE. Very noticeable squeaking electronic noises form the chasis, almost like it has one of those loud old spinning disk hard drives (which it does not since it is an SSD). SO DISAPPOINTING! I don't know if I can bare to give it a 3rd try, but it's hard to find these same specs for the price anywhere else.CAN THE SELLER PLEASE COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE AND HELP ME OUT?*****UPDATE 2-26-2018I decided to order a 3RD unit but this time I went for a slightly different model (the one with the 7th gen processor and the graphics card UX430UQ) and the coil whine problem is gone! Well, mostly - it is unnoticeable but if I hold my ear to the upper left corner I can maybe faintly hear it when it is working hard. Can't even hear it at a normal usage distance with it on my lap. So I'm keeping this one, BUT before you run off and buy the UX430UQ note that this model does not have as good battery life as the UX430UA due to the graphics card. I'm getting maybe 5-6hrs with light usage, I was hoping for better. I wish I could have bought the UA model without graphics and better battery life but I just couldn't stand the coil whine.The model I bought : https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072WK2PVP/ref=twister_B077BNJHVJ?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1
**COIL WHINE? LOOK**Reduced the coil whine tremendously by setting my wallpaper to solid black, and changing battery settings from 'performance' to 'balanced'; it still screeches from time to time but it's not as loud as it was before. Hope it helped you!It's an amazing laptop, beautiful and very powerful for how thin it is. I use it for music production via Fruity Loops and some light gaming like CS:GO and LoL. The only problem I have with it is the EXTREMELY loud coil whine. It got to the point where it annoys the hell out of me. I can hear it even if I'm playing music fairly loud or have a lot of background noise going on. Wish there was a fix for it.. otherwise it would've definitely been a 5/5.EDIT** I can't stand the coil whine. Nasty screeching staticy noise even while just web browsing. It's NOT the fan; top left of the computer.Find it freezing at times randomly in applications as well. Would return it but I don't have the time to wait because of work and school. Wish I went with something else..But if it weren't for the noise, this would be perfect. Exterior quality is superior along with a very nice display. Pretty sturdy keyboard too.EDIT***: FIXED... kinda
Unfortunately, it seems this laptop suffers from the typical Asus/Amazon quality control issues.The unit I received is clearly defective. Fist thing I noticed: there is some pretty bad blacklight bleed on the screen. The processor also makes a very loud and unsettling electrical sizzling noise. It can be heard all the way across my living room when the computer is just idling on the desktop. It gets even louder the more you stress the processor, and it's a very high pitched whine. If you have high frequency hearing loss you may not even hear it, but for me its unbearable.I have monitored the temps on the CPU while doing various tasks with the computer. Doing anything more than web browsing makes the temps jump above 70C, and the fan is constantly whining.I kept testing out the laptop to try and figure out what was up, and in the process I got several BSODs, and the battery strangely went from 74% to 0% while the laptop was just sitting on my desk for a couple of hours.Something is definitely wrong with the power delivery system, or the CPU. I have requested a replacement, but have not yet heard anything back fro Amazon. I really hope I am not stuck with a defective machine.I really want to love this machine. The specs, design and build quality are exceptional. I am truly hoping that I can get a working replacement and can update my review.
The overall build quality of this laptop is superb. The screen looks really good even at 1080p resolution. The feel and weight of the laptop feels sleek and clean. The track pad feel is average but the tactility of the clicks are very nice and prominent.However, this laptop isn't perfect. The keyboard is extremely mushy and subpar. Having the power button on the top right corner doesn't help either. And the worst part is definitely the loud and distinctive could whine.Thankfully for me, the specs and price of the laptop makes up for the downsides. So overall, I'm still quite happy with my purchase decision. If only the coil whine didn't exist, this laptop would've been the best I've used up to date.
I`m just using this laptop for the last 2 days and already en-counting few issues like , fan is very noisy when starts at max power.The back of the laptop become extremely hot when you trying to do multiple tasks , even hotter when the charger is plugged.When i try to access C:/ drive it froze for 20 sec and after that allow me to explore the drive. Kind of disappointed about this laptop which have great configuration for this amount of money cost, i`m still thinking to return or not , if problems persist definitely i will return it.
I went with the ZenBook because it was the only affordable system that offered 16 GB of RAM and a 526 GB SSD. After 2 months of use I have few complaints. Fast and trouble-free. Minimal bloatware. My only criticisms are a power button that is overly easy to activate (would prefer having to hold it down for a second) and a fairly dim display even on full brightness. Would recommend, if it fits your budget.
I bought this laptop for Linux (Solus). Everything works great for my needs. The ambient light sensor and fingerprint readers need additional drivers that I haven't installed (because I don't want those features), but the rest of the hardware works perfectly on a default install. I Installed TLP and thermald and I'm getting the stated 9hrs of battery life with moderate usage. Additionally, this laptop doesn't include some of the things that don't play well with Linux yet, such as 360/tablet mode, touch screen, and 4k resolution. Honestly couldn't be happier with it as a replacement for my Macbook Air.Tip: out of the box you have to do a few things to be able to enter the BIOS so you can disable secure boot and tweak the boot manager to boot to your Linux install. Amazon won't let me post links to that info in this review, but you can find it with a little searching.Final Note: I didn't hear the fan "whine" as others have reported. Based on everything I've read this was a Windows specific problem that was fixed in later software updates.
Love this laptop. I'm so sad to see the newer gen laptops that have removed the MicroSD card reader and all the "normal" USB ports. This laptop has been rock solid. I'm running Linux Mint on it and it works perfectly. The keyboard is perfect - especially the arrow keys (the newer models cram the four arrow keys together in a very un-user-friendly way, but this model has a great keyboard.) The matte screen is exactly what I wanted. I absolutely didn't want a touch screen, they waste battery and you end up with a screen covered in fingerprints and one that reflects everything behind you, making it difficult to get work done.All in all, this was a great purchase. Thank you Asus for providing a great laptop for Linux users!
The Laptop works great, but has coil whine, and is my second laptop, the first one came with a terrible fan noise, Asus, you shoul care more about your quality controls
This is my first Asus. I was Toshiba lover and also worked with Dell and Lenovo provided by my company. I do basic tasks in this laptop (Office, Google Docs, working online) and works great. I found this LT very reliable and easy to carry everywhere. There are things like the number of ports available, but I was aware when I choose it.Not missing Toshiba at all.
Impressed with the portability, the display, battery life and performance of this ultrabook. But my concerns about Asus' quality control remain: the computer has a noticeable coil whine emanating from the top left corner of the base (near where the escape key is), and the notebook has a serious chassis flex problem. The unit I have got delivered with a keyboard that is somewhat (by atleast 1 mm) recessed into the chassis near the D-F-G-V keys owing to the aluminum chassis having bent.The coil whine problem is not that serious on my unit, but to pay a $1,000 to have a notebook delivered with a bent chassis has been disappointing to say the least.
Did not have any issues with quality of product. Booted up very nicely, no fan or hardware noises. Windows 10 prompts easy to follow and computer was ready very quickly.If you're looking for something for school or light office work then this is a very good laptop.
So far this laptop has completely met my expectations. Extremely light yet feels rigid enough, loads all my 3D design software fast and nice. Graphics could be faster... but not for this price tag! I love Windows 10, and particularly the fact it is not Windows 8...The only but I find it that when plugged it generates that weird electric field around the keyboard and behind the screen that you feel when you pass your finger or hand. It is strange, I guess it is because there is no ground on the Power Supply?
Iâve been waiting for this version (the UX430-DH74) since itâs updated with intelâs 8th gen low-power cores, which for the first time are quad rather than dual core. So it was definitely worth waiting a couple of months for that.Overall, this is a great laptop â?I love it. The 14â?screen is beautiful, with plenty of brightness, and itâs matte which is my preference. Itâs not touch-enabled, which might be a dealbreaker for some, but I donât see the point in touch screens on laptops anyway, and I detest their glossy reflections. It does use PWM to modify brightness however; which shouldn't affect the majority of users but some might get eyestrain or headaches. It doesn't affect me personally so it's fine, and a lot of modern screens use PWM so it can be difficult to avoid.Overall, build quality is pretty good. There is a tiny flex in the metal surrounding the keypads, and again in the lid, but itâs negligible and barely noticeable and certainly shouldnât impact usage.Other reviews have noted the cooling performance, and yes, the fans do start up when doing cpu intensive tasks. Some people have installed Notebook Fan Control to increase the heat threshold at which the fan operates, but I havenât since it doesnât really bother me â?with normal usage, I certainly canât hear it over other background noises coming in from outside/my fridge. Itâs noticeable when it is under stress, but that tends to only be when Iâm doing some light gaming and Iâll either have headphones in or music playing. On the whole, Iâd rather the fan switches on to keep the cpu cool than to have it heat up more but be quieter.The fingerprint sensor is a useful feature to have â?it saves a couple of seconds logging in. Scanning accuracy isnât always great, though, and Iâve added 3 different profiles of the same finger to ensure it always recognises me â?ie with cold/dry finger, wet shrivelled finger from the shower and a ânormalâ?one. This seems to work, though you do need to add slight pressure when using it or it doesnât recognise you.On the whole this is a great laptop, very good value for money as Asus almost always is. Donât let the negative reviews put you off: they seem to have defective units or subjective problems with the device â?I like the circular shine effect on the lid, itâs simple yet classy.
Iâve been using this for 3 months.The fingerprint reader never worked very well and itâs very frustrating. Now itâs failing all the times.The fans kick in as soon as you watch a YouTube or vlc video. There is a coil whine. Doesnât bother me but beware.Already has a burned pixel right in the middle of the screen basically where the ASUS logo show up on boot.
I connect this to my tv via hdmi and use a wireless keyboard and mouse while at home. It works great to view streaming video. It is very slim and will be easy to travel with. It is great for everything i do except play games on high settings.
Real good value for money. The system breezes through most developer tasks and is very portable and cool. Battery life is decent too. Boot times are excellent.the 8550U is comparable to 7th gen HQ processors. thats a HUGE step-up for a U processor. If you are buying a laptop in 2018 and are conscious of the budget, definitely give this a look.
*I've added an update to the review at the end*First of all this laptop has great value for price which is tough to match for any other brand on the market. Most people mentioned this but I think it needs to be emphasized. I've had it for about a month and love the look and overall design. The weight is awesome as it's very light yet the aluminum material gives a very classy feel but not as much as the UX390 does with the gold colored details. The technical specs are great but SSD speed could be better, both UX390 and most Dell XPS versions have better speed which is the only area this laptop fails to meet my expectations. 8th generation i7 is running really smooth with no delays so far. The heat is not an issue as it doesn't seem to heat up and I love the speakers as I don't even need any exterior sound system around for a very good experience.It would be better if the same sound experience could be had in non-Windows environments but I'm guessing the drivers should be on the way.Besides the SSD speed the only issue I've witnessed is the scratchy noise like most people mentioned. From my observation it seems to happen when the laptop isn't on a flat surface so some fan looks to be causing the issue.Overall this is a great choice for anyone that doesn't care about the occasional scratchy noise and always on the go. Good connectivity and weight that stands out.UPDATE:I prefer Linux over Windows but stuck with the pre-installed Windows 10. After Ubuntu 18 came out I installed it about 2 weeks ago (May 2018) and haven't noticed the noise since. The original issue might simply be driver related in Windows but too early to tell. I'll be updating this information if I notice the noise again.
Works great. Super fast. Lightroom runs awesome, some games even work well on it. I like the design. It's light. And yes it's a bit noisy at times but I've gotten used to it.
This is a super fast 8th gen i7 15" laptop in a 14" form factor.
Iâve had this laptop for about a month but have only used it twice. I noticed a loud whine sound an upon seeing reviews clearly this is common. And was told this was 10 hour battery but when you hover over the battery icon after a full charge it tops out at 4 hours. Incredible hard to be a college student and need to charge every four hours.
Outstanding computer. Lightweight, fast, and very capable. I use it mainly for general purpose school work and software development, and it handles everything I've thrown at it easily. Plus its size and weight make it very portable.
Its not a mac-book in terms of display definition and components but then its less than half the price, 16GB ram & 8th gen i7 windows 10, fast portable and light. I've read blogs about the fan and yes it comes on for a short time when hot but its not too annoying. I like this laptop a lot, no regrets and strongly recommend.
kid stuff still in the box
There's a small electronic humming that is annoying me. Everything else about it is great.
the accounting department approves
Purchased this product 06/2018 after seeing reviewers claiming the coil whine problem was resolved on later models. It's still present. Returned.
I received my laptop a few day ago, and i'm enjoying every moment of it. Asus Zenbook is pack with tons of features and programs which is easy to understand and control. I have to say, I'm a completely satisfied customer. Thank you!
PROS:Slim and really portable.Good priceStrong technical featuresGreat battery lifeCONS:Won't wake up from sleep. I needed to reset the laptop several times! It is really annoying!!!LoudPoor fingerprint sensor
excellent computer for the price, absolutlely no fan noise as other reviewers have said, will update if any problem comes up
This laptop is incredibly portable and fast. As an student of Systems Engineering, I really need a laptop fast enough to do my job without trouble, not for gaming. The build quality is excellent, the battery is great but it could be better.
The computer at all looks very beautiful and great. However, the first date I got it the noise of the fan was very terrible, I returned it immediately. I can imagine in the future it will get worse and worse.
I just receive my Asus, everything is nice the laptop is very well crafted, slim and light. I would give it 5/5 if it didnt lack one of the (Rubber feet) on the back of the laptop. This kind of things should not happen on any new product, less on a 1000$ product. I expect you to send me some spare rubber feets at least.
amazing machine. super lightweight, solid, great spec. bought a second one with the better graphics card (UX430UN) for a tiny bit more money and infinitely better gaming performance.
So happy with my new superfast machine! Asus at its best.
This is a good laptop for anyone who needs something light and portable. I have had zero problems with mine so far. The real battery life is about ten hours and it recharges quickly. It is easy and quick to type on with good key feel and travel. If I could change one thing it would be the screen flex. This version has a metal top but when I first opened it I could tell that the cover was so lightweight that it would bend very easily, which it does. On the other hand, I believe that this is the best laptop overall that you can buy at the low end of $1000. The 8th gen i7 is very fast and I expect to be happily using this laptop for several years. Also, the slim bezels which allow for the 14-inch screen in this form factor are important. Don't go out and get a 13-inch screen on another laptop. That extra inch makes a difference.
I love the laptop but am seriously annoyed at the cool whine... this meets if not exceeds my expectations but I wish the coil whine issue would be fixed.
great deal
As expected. No issues.
For this price I have nothing to complain about. It's doing everything well so far. Low price. High specs. That's all about it.
Received it with a broken light....the screen wouldn't work. Had to return and order a new one.
super cool. great value for money.
I bought it in December and I have not had any issues so far. Its performance is quite impressive and has a good battery life.
Excellent laptop .. very light and portable .. no complaints.
I purchased a new Asus UX430UAR. Set up and immediately experienced blurry text in some programs. I contacted ASUS customer support and spent 2 days going back n forth with them. They identified that my computer did not have Splendid, Eye Care, Tru2life Video and Audio Wizard software. Upon installing drivers I received the "Missing ICM file" when Splendid was installing. Customer service had me reset my computer back to factory and I still received the error. They recommended that I send it back to seller (Amazon). I received my new laptop and once set up with all current updates, still no Splendid, Eye Care, Tru2life or Audio wizard!! Went through installing all the drivers again, received the same error "Missing ICM file". Very frustrated that 2 computers both have the same problem with no fix from ASUS.
This laptop has been a great buy. It is very light, fast and neat. I am very happy with it
Powerhouse laptop for an affordable price! Amazing sound and performance.
What I did not like was that it is not a touch screen
The computer didn't work. After a lot of trouble, returned it after 2 months.
It appears the the keyboard does not work. Will be returning.
it makes an annoying noise, it is not the fan but an electric sound
Coil sound! what's going on with Asus?
COIL WHINE!!!
Good modern product. Arrived in time.
it's fast, quiet most of the time.
Finally got it. Powered it on, seems ok and snappy. Charged it to full and continue my setup. This morning, while browsing the web there seemed to be scratching sound which I thought was coming from the speakers, so I muted the volume and it still didn't go away. I simply ignored it but already feeling anxious what that scratchy/rattly sound is. Next hour, Windows crashes, (thinking perhaps I should've stayed with Mac). After Windows did its thing to dump and restart. The keyboard started flashing. Did a couple restarts and search the net for a solution. Nothing resolved it. A bit gutted now to have bought a possibly expensive paperweight.Update: update to fix the flashing keyboard... I just did a complete reset of the laptop again and that seemed to resolve it. however, I still get the scratchy/rattly sound once in a while
The computer is just fine right now. However it's cheaper than I bought. I bought it two weeks ago. And it's getting cheaper.
All the people complaining about cpu noise are being awfully fussy. My wife loves her new laptop
A beautiful, powerful, and lightweight laptop. I have bought mine in USA and I am just started to use it in my home, Brazil. By the moment it is working like expected, fast and quiet. But, does not have a regular hdmi port and unfortunately none adapter was included in the box, neither for the regular size nor to a vga port (for a such expensive computer and based on my experience with Asus - this is not my first Asus laptop, it was really disappointing). At home I like to use with a mouse and keyboard wireless and connected in a bigger screen (vga connection in my case). Just because of the lack of one or two adaptora, I give it the four stars, otherwise it would certainly five stars.
I purchased this because I wanted to upgrade the Asus UX303UB I purchased a few years ago mainly to get the quad core i7 8550 processor. I've had Asus computers in the past and have never had a problem. This one does not disappoint. It's fast, with a boot time of 3.5 seconds. It's light, with a weight of about 2.8 lbs. It's attractive, with the space grey color. And the display is, quite simply, stunning. Some reviews have talked about the fan being noisy. Yes, you can hear the fan but it isn't overly loud. One would expect the fan to run to dissipate the heat in such a small space. The only thing I wish this model had would be an nvidia graphics card but the Intel 620 graphics works well.I'm very happy that I purchased this machine.
Annoying traits with this computer. Rarely logs on to internet without being prompted, sometimes takes several tries. Touchpad left clicks often do not work, take a lot of pressure, hard to find a good place to press to engage a non null click. Backlight on keyboard will often require several clicks of the f key to start working. Would have preferred a standard hdmi port. Tiny one on this computer is hard to use and seems like it is designed to wear out. Is slim, but is not light. I guess I expected it to be a little more friendly. It is fast, has good connectivity and I like the non glare screen and chiclet keys. If the touchpad worked better I would have given it 4 stars
I got mine at Costco about a week ago. So far it is everything I was looking for. I almost talked myself out of buying it because of all the gripes in the one star ratings here at Amazon. So far I've had none of the perpetual fan running, screeching innards or other cited failings that had nearly kept me from buying it. I have not attempted the fingerprint reader, having enough frustration with that on my Android phone. The only time I noticed the fan was when I was loading software. After that, the fan has been quiet or barely noticeable when it does run.I will admit that I'm not doing processor intensive work. I bought this mostly for a travel computer, and it appears to be ideal for that. It's slim, lightweight and the battery appears to hold a long enough charge that I won't need to haul the charger in my carry on bag, so I'm looking forward to a lighter load on future trips.Although my intention was for travel, as I'm getting used to using it, I'm finding I use it far more for every day work than the travel notebook that it replaced. Some of that is no doubt because of the beautiful display as well as the pleasure of using the accurate mouse pad and keyboard.
Lightweight with a small footprint, quick enough for everyday tasks, good build quality for the price. I purchased this laptop from another retailer for about 700 dollars in November of 2017 which is a great value for what this computer offers.l
Deciding to wait for i7-8550U processor was a good decision. It finally has 4 cores. It really makes the difference. Now I have a device which is small and light but its performance is comparable to desktop machines. If we use the full potential however the battery drains very fast and it can get hot - but this is something I was expecting. Device is perfect if you need high performance from time to time. If you just do web browsing, 8-9h on battery is achievable.Aluminium body looks and feels very solid. Screen is also very good.It has warranty which actually works in Poland where I live. It is not that common when buying Laptops abroad!
great laptop. great specs for its price. good battery life with average of 7-8 hours. High quality matte display with minimal bezels (slightly more than the xps 13 but it is unnoticeable). really like the setting that allows users to adjust brightness of the backlit keyboard.
This is an excellent laptop and might be the best laptop on the market right now. It is extremely fast with a high-resolution display. It is extremely light and is feasible for students because of its weight.
I got this as a gift about 6 months ago. I read the reviews and got worried about noises coming from inside and to be honest I ONLY heard that during the initial set up of the system. I am a Computer Science major, so I use it often for programming and do minor graphic designing with it. This thing is a beast and does everything I want it to and quickly. Iâm very pleased with it and am glad to have it.
I bought this through Costco had to return it due to poor cooling performance this thing runs fans always and thermal throttles the gpu.
Very nice laptop. No problems with it.
Probably the worst product I've ever purchased in my life. Runs loud and hot at idle, build quality is so bad my 130% dell officemax laptop is sturdier than this, sharp scratchy edges, doesn't even sit flat on a flat surface like a wobbly uneven table, EVERYTHING flexes and bends where you don't want it to, heavy for how flimsy and hollow it feels, keyboard is a gross mushy mess like typing on a plastic bag over a wet blanket, cant put ANY other OS on it, windows 10 makes me wanna vomit my childhood dreams into the nearest trash bin, power button is where the delete button is.....wtf for real its like they took the worst keyboard from the cheapest chromebook they could find and duct taped it in there, computer is UGLY not because of the design choice but because of awkward warped areas in the cheap plastic body, when closed the top back of the screen flexes in ALOT and the circular shine effect looks cheap and uneven, not even very slim for how slow this pc is, I've seen way slimmer and smaller cheap knockoffs from china that ran faster than this dunce, the whole laptop lifts up when you try to open the screen so it required both hands yet the screen wobble is somehow worse than anything I've ever gotten my hands on. Also the whole thing feels very pointless, "fast" processor costs a lot of money but its not fast enough to do more than browsing, and looking at media so you might as well get something 500$ cheaper. If you want to know what if feels like to truly get ripped off buy this loose turd.
Asus will not stand by their inferior products and the only warranty service offered is replacing parts, which are seconds rejected by manufacturers and other companies.Every Asus product I have ever seen is junk.Do not waste your money on any Asus product!
Great laptop for an awesome price. Thanks for the quick shipment.
I went into this purchase a little nervous. My other tablet/laptop hybrid experiences had been bad.But I can honestly say this is perfect for my needs. It is very good for annotating PDF files and the pen is more responsive than I expected. It is a little heavy to be used one handed, but it's large enough to brace against your body. I've gotten more arm strain from much smaller lighter devices.As a laptop the keyboard is well sized and easy to type on. All the keys are well placed. My only complaint is that there is no 10 key on the side, but with this size that wouldn't be possible.Battery life is decent, probably 4-8 hours. It multitasks well, I've watched videos with multitab chrome running in the background. Speaking of chrome, it runs great until you get about 12-15 tabs up. Then it get's a little slooooow. The touch screen is as responsive and a flagship smart phone. And I've had no trouble with my wifi connecting at all.I haven't tried any games yet, because I'm assuming it won't have the power. I'll update if I try.
I'm very impressed with this 2 in 1 laptop. I have been using it daily for 2 weeks now and have had no problems at all. It's light and sturdy and the hindges are very good. I work on the go 5 days a week with children. This laptop has made keeping up with paperwork a breeze and I also let the kids use it for educational games and apps. I also enjoy drawing so the pen is definitely a plus and feels natural when drawing. I recommend this laptop to everyone.
i really like this laptop. it does have cons like not having a cd/dvd player, and not having a type A usb port, but it overall works very well. ive had it for a few months and have not had any problems
First of, the laptop I received had a battery defect so I requested for a replacement the very next day I got it. I received the replacement after 2 days and I fell in love with the features especially with the price. I only use it for the basic stuff and it isn't that fast but I'm fine with it. But after 2 weeks of use, one of the hinges became misaligned rendering it unable to be closed without breaking it. I wasn't being careless or anything, I was just closing it like I usually do and I just heard a something crack all of a sudden. I am very disappointed with the quality of this one. It's hinges are supposed to be one of the strongest parts since it transforms into a tablet. I just hope I'll be able to return this and I will definitely get a more pricey one. Just waiting for asus to respond to my email.
I only just got this computer today, but I love it! I do wish it had a regular USB port but, I knew that going in. The only problem I have had so far is I closed the computer and the screen would not come on so I had to turn it off and back on but after that it was fine. I really love how lightweight the computer is and the size is just perfect. My previous computer was a 2010/11 model MacBook Pro and I find that the dimensions and appearance are very similar, just now sleeker and thinner. I didn't think I would use the tablet function much on this computer but after testing it out today I may have to play around with it more. I saw several negative reviews about this machine and I don't see why, other than perhaps those people just got a bad egg. I would most definitely recommend this computer to students and anyone who needs a lightweight computer on the go or something easy for personal use. Maybe not for someone who needs their computer to do tons of heavy lifting, as it is not meant for that. All in all, I am really happy I bought this computer, I will check in if my opinion changes.
This is a pretty good tablet/laptop. The colors and brightness of the screen are vivid and the touch screen is responsive. Build quality is quite good too. Itâs seems like the hinges will hold up long term when converting it to a tablet as long as you are gentle when folding it.
Bought this 2in1 for my mom, she absolutely loves it. Very few complaints in the first 2 months. If there was one thing she could add, it would be a second camera. It's a little difficult to take pics with the rear facing camera (unless you're taking a selfie), but that's not a deal-breaker. Also, she was upgrading from an Android ASUS, so she didn't have access to the apps she had been using. To remedy this, we unstalled an Android emulator on this system. Now she has all of her old Android apps, along with the new Windows apps.
It seems to be a nice machine. I wouldn't buy this due to the flash drive is so small and it keeps trying update and there is no room for the update. You can't stop the updates from downloading. I needed this to take exams on-line so I figured the small drive would be ok. But I was wrong.Don't buy this or HP. You get what you pay for. It's too late to send back. I have exams due.
Super bargain
Updated it to Pro immediately. All the updates took all day. A little quirky at times but seems to be very handy.
i like how light it is. its super sleek and nice looking. i dont like how there is no cd player and no usb port. i didnt know that it didnt include those features. i also don't know if you can extend the one year warrany it comes with.
I got this laptop for my online college and it works great. The mousepad allows for all functions (like right-click w 2-fingers or clicking the lower right button, it allows for double-tap, 1-click or left-button to select). I like the big screeb and the ability to flip it into tablet mode. The pen is really nice when I'm ready to take a break and do some adult coloring. And it's super light weight. I'm loving it! This is a great machine for the price... But if you are looking for something to do gaming or heavy-lifting dont expect this to do the trick.
Great laptop. Holds a charge. Like for days. Iâm impressed. This is the perfect laptop for daily use.
Replaced an older Asus netbook with this. This is a very nice laptop for general use. Switched to Win 10 Pro from S right away. It took about 2.5 hours to complete. It had 38 GB free on the HD while in S mode, but after switching to Pro, it only has 13 GB free. I tested the latest release of Ubuntu (18.04) on it and it runs well. Everything works. The only negative thing I can say about this laptop is the lack of storage space after switching to Pro, but that is because Windows 10 is so bloated.
It has been wonderful and easy to use. Has everything necessary for my office.
Love it my son tried to talk me out of touch screen but Iâm glad I didnât listen . Screen bigger than I thought love how cornea talks to you didnât know that was a feature !!
Love it
I loved the idea of having a convertible laptop, but this computer is terrible. It barely functions! I canât even scroll through Facebook without having serious delays. I would click on the screen and the mouse would be several inches away all the time, so I would have to click in a different area on the screen to get the mouse where I wanted it- even on the touchscreen! I canât stand to use this stupid thing, and Iâm sending it back ASAP. The only reason Iâm giving it two stars is because the hinge system seems really sturdy, and the touchscreen is cool (when it works). I do not recommend this laptop.
Let me start off by saying this laptop is great. it's very cheap compared to other flipbooks which is nice, and its specs aren't bad considering. It's fast enough to handle normal internet browsing, and of course any office/ school work, its touch screen is great and useful, and it's nice, light, and sleek. the one thing that could be better is the pen. if you're drawing with it you may have difficulties. It regularly will think the pen is not touching the screen for a fraction of a second, so if you hit ctrl+z it will only remove part of what you drew, sometimes this makes gaps in lines aswell. you'll have to press harder than you might be comfortable with and i havent' see na way to increase pen sensitivity just through windows ink or through pen and touch settings. This laptop only has 2 USB ports, a C type and a microUSB type, so you will likely need an adapter. and the microUSB is upsidown for some reason, which is odd. lastly if the screen is free standing, AKA not stood upsidedown like the mail thumbnail or made to look like a tablet, the screen is a bit wobbly, which is fine for touch input, but not for the pen.Overall the cons sound worse than they are, this is a great laptop, it could just use some quality of life improvements aswell as a more functional penPros affordable plenty fast for academic/office work/lightweight drawing software sleek and portable touch screen works great touch keyboard is very responsive all around a good experienceCons pen sensitivity could work better only 2 USB ports, neither of which are the traditional USB-A type you will probably need adapters screen is a little wobbly when using pen in 2 of 4 (or more?) possible positions
Exactly what I expected and came in great condition.
Love everything about this product, the Microsoft word,excel, PowerPoint, makes my reports easy.is thin so i can actually carry it around like a phone .ð
Big Asus fan. Not disappointed one bit.
Great battery, weight, processing speed, and the coolest is the tablet feature! ð
This laptop is everything I need and more. I love it. And the stylus pen is a bonus!
This laptop does everything for me. From tablet mode to regular laptop plus it has a touchscreen. The intel processor is more than enough for what I need. I also took this to New york and the battery lasted the entire trip and it also worked in the freezing cold outside. I was able to run most games and also netflix. I like this laptop for the price. Great device.
Not a powerful device but it serves its purpose. Ideal for a child where you wonât worry as much about them losing or breaking it.
no usb connection for usb mouse
Poor. Do not buy. Problematic.
This machine worked well for the first 4 months or so. Then the headaches started. It has been repaired 3 times in 5 weeks and is about to be repaired again. Logic board twice, memory once. I would rather have a new one or a different model. It is beyond frustrating.
Super fast and plenty of memory for my needs using this as my work only laptop. My only critique (and it's not really important) is that this laptop is much heavier than similar machines.
This is a great price point for an i7 with an SSD. I was a little surprised a machine described as "Business Flagship Dell" came with Windows 10 Home. I now have to install Windows 10 Professional to be able to join it to our Active Directory Domain.It is very "plasticy" which is to be expected at this price. I own an M3800 and M4800 and this does not compare in aesthetics but more than compensates for with speed.
Arrived on time, well packaged and as described. Works great for everyday home use.
The cpu performance is sluggish, very disappointing. Running with basic apps only. Also no touch screen.
Arrived on time, holiday Rush notwithstanding. Solid performance at a reasonable price. Dell has always delivered for us.
functions well. A bit larger than I expected, but a good substitute for a desktop machine.
So far working great, very fast startup and shutdown.
This is a great computer. It's fast and I like that it's lighter than my 17" HP.
Very good laptop, just what I wanted
My wife loves it!
Fast and affordable!!
Excellent Laptop !!!!!
Best laotop I ever owned
i have this exact laptop. love it. purchased it at staples for $450."2017 Business Flagship Dell Inspiron 15.6" LED-Backlit Display Laptop PC Intel i7-7500U Processor 8GB DDR4 RAM 256GB SSD DVD-RW Backlit-keyboard HDMI 802.11ac Webcam Bluetooth Windows 10-Gray "
The use of the phrase "Certified Refurbished" for this item is insulting. My experience with "Certified Refurbished" is that a customer bought something, and for some small reason, the item was returned to the manufacturer who fixed it and then slapped the "Certified Refurbished" label on there and the item is supposed to be better than new in many cases. But this thing came out of the box reeking of the abuse that it had received. This Chromebook had been heavily used -- signs of wear all over it in terms of scratches and paint literally worn off. It was horrible. But I am a good sport. I took responsibility because I had stupidly failed to read the reviews -- most of them warned me that this would happen! But the system was unusable because the mousepad failed to work. Amazon was great and gave the refund. I will surely not be doing business with this seller under any circumstances.This listing heavily misrepresented the quality of the item for sale.
My daughter loves it and can do anything on it. She needed it for school and has already finished several projects. Great investment.
I got this for my granddaughter for Christmas. So far, so good. She loves it and is using it a lot. There's a little crack in the case, but hopefully we can keep that from getting worse.
After researching many refurbished Chromebooks I decided on this one because it sounded like we wold receive a like new item. I have had many of refurbished cell phones in the past with no issues, I thought it would be along the lines of that. As soon as I took it out of the box, I noticed scratches all over, some looked like chips. This was for my daughter for Christmas and time was running out, so I bought her a pretty purple cover for it and hoped that would be okay. A couple of weeks ago we noticed a broken part by the USB ports, and the real kicker, we have only had this for just over 2 months, and she opened it today to the screen looking cracked from the inside and very damaged, it was fine when she was done using it last night and put it in its case and up off the floor when she went to bed. There seems to be no reasoning for this, other than I should have paid $30 more for a brand new product, even though we have only had it 2 months, I don't think there is a thing that can be done, I will just have a very upset little girl until I can afford to buy her a new one.
I wouldnât recommend purchasing. I received a super dinged and scratched up one and when we went to set it up the battery didnât charge or hold a charge whatsoever, so it was completely defective and useless.
Advertised as certified refurbished, more like used !!!â?Seems to operate ok , but thereâs a crack on the backside of the screen, many nicks around all the edges, itâs been used a lot before I got it Not what I expected to see
Works great. Arrived right on time and packaging was good. Looks new and it works great
Damaged and not refurbished didn't work looked like someone dropped it
Purchased for my teenage daughter who is able to access all that is important to a teenager.
The laptop is in good use but the charger after a week of using it it doesn't work it stopped working it doesn't charge it it just completely doesn't fit the computer plug in piece I understand it's a refurbished computer but the charger for the computer should not be loose and it moves around to much to use the plug to charge it
Product works great but item had more wear and tear then advertised especially on the screen in which the product description completely left out.
Looks just like the picture, works great, and has a nice design. Came in two days like it said and I would buy it again.
PURCHASED ITEM FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT.
Didn't hold a charge once charged to 100% and taken off of the charger...and sent the laptop back three weeks ago and no sign of seeing a refund yet...
The laptop is working, however, it is very used and busted up. I was expected a refurbished laptop but not one that is THIS* mistreated. There's marks and dents all over, the pads on the bottom are even falling off. Was hoping for something in a better condition.
I got the packet as described. Nice cool laptop. I recommend everyone to buy
I like the way it works. Just a few days after I got it, the charger stopped working
It came in the package scratch up and half of the screen was dark
Not very user friendly
Itâs a good chromebook for a good price. Worth the purchase
This thing should be given away then thrown away. Poor condition stopped working after first use and I had to pay to ship it back
Laptop in bad condition. I wish i wouldn't have ordered now, because I now have to buy a better laptop to fit my business needs.
The laptop is working great and it does everything I need it for. Thanks.
Itâs great internet service didnât give me no problem and thereâs nothing bout it that I donât like
I thought once i recieved it it would have some type of issue with it but nope! Its all good
I was nervous about ordering a refurbished computer, but couldnât be happier with it!
My Laptop Was In Great Condition Works Just Fine & Very Fast I Loved My Order Thank you so much!!!
Good laptop small enough o fit almost anywhere fast has apps love it
Scratched and never received warranty I bought with it
Screen did not work properly. Returned the laptop to the seller.
Item has lots of scratches. Very slow. freezes.
No because I couldn't download
Easy to use.. good purchase
Arrived fast and has been great so far!
Did not work...
Works great
Itâs terrible
Arrived b4 said date love it
Too small
This is the worst misrepresentation by the seller. Both Samsung products were refurbished and that is why it was presented at a lower price for $139.99. Both products have lots of scratches on top monitor. One of them on the left corner of the keyboard is bent and cracked. I was planning to give them as Christmas gifts to my daughters, now I have to return them and get another set. Really disappointment.
Awesome purchase! Thank you.
Great laptop for school, my godson loves it.
Screen already busted within its first month, don't feel like distributing it back to a repairer. Have to keep it for now. Not satisfied, very disappointed with this product.
Having technical issues with the scroll pad
Not a verified purchase, but from others' descriptions I wanted to add info that might be helpful. This appears to be a "Grade C" used computer. Unsure about the "certified refurbished" part, but NewEgg is selling the same one right now, and they note that they're "Grade C: C grade refers to an item that may have cosmetic damages. Scratch and Dent products are systems with considerable cosmetic blemishes that do not affect performance. Scratch and Dent computers will not have scratches or pits on the screen, missing or illegible letters on the keyboard, or damage to the touchpad or palmrest."The seller/Amazon should note that on this product description.
I wanted to buy an MSI laptop for a while and after waiting for nearly 2 yrs finally I was able to purchase this beauty.Excellent packaging. Good protection. When I got the laptop for the first time, the screen was defective and Amazon customer service did a fantastic job in not only making sure they arranged for the quick return of the laptop but also ensured replacement was sent in time.Thank you for understanding my plea and for your prompt action.Laptop looks great & it is extremely light (very surprised by this)Processor:-It comes with the i7 7700hq processor. It is fast and provides smooth operation.Backlit keyboard - red color.Keyboard:-The keyboard layout is excellent, well spaced out keys for fast typing.There is a separate number keypad like what you find on normal keyboards for desktop pcs.There are many shortcut keys. Keys feel great while typing.Experienced typists will have a great time typing on this keyboard.The touchpad is very responsive and works very well. You can pinch to zoom or scroll up and down using two fingers.Windows:-It came with Windows 10 home edition. I should have spoken with customer service to get windows 10 pro, don't like home edition at all.Being an IT guy I prefer Windows 10 pro over home edition any day.Battery:-Laptop doesn't get heated up at all. You won't think about it even once. The adapter doesn't get heated up either even after using for long hours. So people who want to use this laptop for long hours, you will love this. I always have the power adapter connected. Battery lasts for 4 hrs - browsing, office work(There is MSI battery software that calibrates the battery, very useful).It was saying 94% plugged in, not charging.I used MSI battery calibration app & overnight it calibrated very well.Now it is showing 100% fully charged. Warning* Do not unplug the charger or use the laptop while this is going on.You will see get this warning even in that app.If you still see this message then drain the battery completelyScreen:-I think the screen is a matte finish. No reflections on the screen & great viewing angles.The 1080p screen is really noticeable. Watching videos or playing games has been a great experience on this laptop. The screen is crystal clear & absolutely gorgeous.Boot time:-Performance - outstanding!!! I am very impressed with fast boot times. 10 seconds to boot up into Windows OS.The laptop is fast and there is no lag whatsoever. Compressing & extracting zip files extremely quickly.Connectivity:-WIFI is excellent, has many options in the settings.Bluetooth connectivity is great. The laptop connects to my Bluetooth speaker pretty quickly and stays connected even after the reboot.4 USB ports. 1 USB 2.0, 1 USB 3.0 and 1 USB 3.1 port along with USB type-c port.Fast data transfer- > It was transferring at 100MB/s speed. Tested it multiple times.128 GB SSD is outstanding, if you have an option go for 256 GB SSD it is really worth the money.There is also 1 TB hard disk for storage. So you have enough space.Wireless Display:-There is Wireless Display option which works really great. This is a huge deal for me because I want to connect to the projector using RKCast and I am extremely happy that it works very well. No lag at all. I played Mortal Kombat XL and didn't notice any lag even with highest settings. Nvidia 1050 totally worth it. But if you are undecided then go for Nvidia GTX 1060 as it supports VR.RAM:-This laptop comes with 8 GB RAM DDR4. The main reason I chose this one because it has the option to upgrade to 32GB in future.Since I didn't have enough money I could afford only 8 GB but if money is not an issue then pick 32 GB. It is totally worth it. Absolutely brilliant performance.Fan noise is very minimal so that is not a problem either because I read many reviews for other laptops (MSI or others) where people complained about laptop fan noise. But that is not a problem at all for this laptop. It is pretty silent and pleasant to use.Camera:-The camera is really good. Press Fn + F6 if you face an issue with camera app on windows. You can take burst shot ( continuous photos) like you can in android phones.Speakers:-Speakers are good, very clear sound, but not comparable to JBL speakers that I used before in my old Dell XPS laptop. They are louder and have good bass. Having said that, I still like the speakers on this laptop. They are not exactly an issue. It will take some time for me to get used to them. But the new buyers can always get great Bluetooth powered speakers for less than 50$ on Amazon.Overall:-I am not deducting any stars for that because the positives in this laptop overshadow everything else.Experience in using this laptop has been outstanding!!!!I totally recommend this laptop to everyone who is looking for a good laptop at a decent price. It is totally worth it whether it is typing documents or running virtual machines or watching videos or playing graphics-intensive games or duplicating the screen to the projector. It does everything flawlessly.I am very impressed. So far I am extremely happy and I hope I don't face any issues or have unpleasant surprises in future.Thank you for reading my review.Update Dec 29th, 2017:-Upgraded my laptop to 32GB after 1 month of purchase. Spent 265$ for 32GB RAM from Crucial 2400 MTS from Newegg website.But my observation is laptop won't use more than 16GB of RAM. So you can decide as per your requirements.When I opened 3 or 4 VMs and running them parallelly, it used at the most 12 or 13GB of RAM but the CPU usage was very high.My setting was 90% for Max CPU usage & Min is at 5% for balanced mode & for high performance - I kept the minimum at 50%. You can set this in Power settings.So my laptop's performance is still outstanding even after 5 months of purchase. It kept getting better & faster every day.Update - June 9th 2018Laptop's performance just kept getting better.Do not install Nvidia driver from the website. Let Windows install the drivers. This way you won't lose the option to connect wirelessly to your projector or TV.Performed best with Windows 1709 update. But after 1803 volume became comparatively lower.I am using Equalizer APO to boost the volume but it is still less for my liking.Windows 1803 has also messed up BluetoothThese issues are more related to Windows 10 pro 1803 update than laptop itself.So watch out for these two problems.Having said that. Windows 1803 improved gaming performance.I can also watch Netflix wirelessly using Intel WiDi on my laptop connected to projector with HDMI dongle.Cheers!Sam
I really like this MSI laptop, its a very good product at a good price.The good:*The specs are awesome [i7-7700HQ|1050 2G|8GB|128GB+1TB] for the price its a bargain.*The OS is installed on the 128GB SSD, it makes everything to run faster, the laptop has a very good performance.*The red backlit keyboard is great. I would like to have more color options, though.*The 1tb HDD was imperative to me.*The image of the screen is beautiful and colorful. I like the anti-glare screens because the areas where i usually work on the day are always so illuminated with many windows.The bad:*The plastic of witch it is made is thin and somewhat fragile.*The sound of the speakers is bad... They lack of bass... i think.*I dont like the touchpad of this laptop, i just dont get used to it... I liked the alienware 13 touchpad more...I recommend this laptop, its a great option for work and play videogames.
Great BUSINESS laptop. The keyboard is far sturdier than the flimsy one in most laptops and the backlighting is not only cool looking but useful. One of the best laptop keyboards ever. Very fast responsive laptop (I use it for business, not gaming) with great storage, great speed and sturdy build. FAR better for the price than comparable laptops from Dell, HP, Toshiba, Acer, ASUS, etc (have used the others).decent battery life - about 4 hours before I get low with heavy use.
Had the laptop for around a month now. The most pleasing aspect of the laptop is the build. The laptop feels solid enough but at the same is not too bulky. I can carry it around for a day without hurting my back. The performance is great. Thanks to the ssd the laptop boots under 8s and other functions are smooth as well. Having an additional HDD certainly helps for gamers though it gives a feel that it takes forever to load games or softwares. The wireless connectivity options are working properly and provide great speeds on wifi. The most frustrating thing is the battery backup. Even with power saving mode on the laptop lasts hardly over an hour and a half. Plus the power saving mode gives the feel of working on a 4-year old netbook! Other than that the laptop has been a great revelation and as a fairly active gamer I'm quite happy with it.
MSI GL62M 7RDX-1408 15.6" Full HD Thin & Light Performance Gaming Laptop Computer Quad Core i7-7700HQ, GeForce GTX 1050 2G Graphics, 8GB DRAM, 128GB SSD+1TB Hard Drive SteelSeries Red Backlit KBI had been looking for a new computer, preferably one that can be/is optimized for gaming, to replace my old Toshiba and I must say this laptop was an excellent buy. Its specs were well worth the price; this machine runs better than my Toshiba when it first came out of its box and has exceeded my expectations. I have had zero issues with this laptop since getting it, it has run all my games fabulously as well as all the programs I need for university and everyday stuff.What I liked:1. Excellent start up time - Laptop loads amazingly fast even from complete shut off it only takes seconds to log in and start up programs.2. Slick aesthetics - I really like the overall design, feel and look of this laptop (it could be made of better materials but its good for its price).3. Good price for specs - After searching through many brands and various laptops I found this one to be a good balance of specs and pricing.4. Keyboard - Always wanted a light up keyboard, the SteelSeries keyboard is nice, smooth and looks great.5. Headphone sound quality - Audio6. Anti glare screen - Must say its amazing the difference between my old Toshiba (and even my sister's Razor) is noticeable. It looks great and I feel like, in addition to the better graphics card, I can see so much more of what's going on on the screen.What I didn't like:1. Short battery life - I got about 3-4 hours of run time before the battery needed to be plugged in, that said the battery life has been/will always be an issue for most powerful gaming machines these days so its not unexpected. Anyone2. Speakers are eh - Generally I use headphones almost all the time with computers however on the occasion that I can't, the speakers on this laptop could be much better. Audio buffs out there that don't want to use headphones should invest in some good speakers cause these won't cut it.
This laptop is excellent as far as performance goes but there are some minor design issues. The construction of this laptop is kind of flimsy. When grabbing it out of my laptop bag, the screen/body compresses more than I am comfortable with. It feels like I am bending the screen. The palm rest area on the keyboard is also flimsy and has some flex to it. Additionally, the material that the laptop shell is made out of absorbs fingerprints like none other. The fingerprints don't just wipe off either, you need a cloth and possibly a mild cleaner to remove the fingerprints (I don't eat at my computer so my fingers are fairly clean to begin with). Besides that, I just wish there was advanced BIOS settings that would allow more control over the hardware.
I've had this computer for at least three days now, so far it has not given me any trouble at all (will update if it does). However, if you want to use your laptop right away I recommend turning it on and leaving the update for windows 10 overnight, since it takes at least half a day to update. I don't play too many games on the PC, I just wanted a computer that would run my game well, but I was honestly impressed by the display and quality. The graphics look amazing and I can run my game smoothly while using high settings. The keyboard is comfortable to use as well, which is another bonus, and for those that don't like the red keyboard light you can turn it off or adjust the brightness. The fan does make a lot of noise when you're playing games (any gaming computer does that at this point), but when you're doing work or searching the web it does not make any noise at all. If you're just wanting a computer to play a couple of games, do work, or search the web then this one is for you. It's also not extremely over budget like the rest! To be honest, you're paying for less and getting a lot.
I work in IT for a living. I can tell you that a computer with an Intel i7 processor, solid state boot up drive with 1 Tera byte extra hard drive for under $1200 is a bargain. And it doesnât have that annoying reflective screen that 4 some reason most do these days. This is my first MSI laptop. I used to be loyal to hp, but those kept failing. By a âgamingâ?laptop if you need one for business. The word âgamingâ?means they are high performance.
I bought this mid-January and it has only left my desk twice, both times in laptop bags handled carefully and neither within the last month. I've had frequent crashing just by switching tabs in firefox with nothing else open, or similar actions, and have not been too pleased with its performance. When it does run properly it works great, but only a little bit better than the $200-300 laptops I've owned in the past. As of today the laptop does not display anything except vertical bars if the screen is moved even the slightest amount. These problems, as well as other lesser issues, would be a frustration in even the bargain-bin laptops I mentioned owning previously, which it should be mentioned never had problems this early on, but in something with this price tag is absolutely inexcusable.
Great laptop, fast bootup around 8 seconds from power on to windows 10. The combination of the SSD and 1TB hard drive makes this thing fly. I love the display it's crisp and beautiful. The keyboard is more like a regular keyboard and the red backlit keys are a great feature as well. The separate number keypad is absolutely great. I can't say enough nice things about this system so far. Running SUSE Linux server and workstation on it and no performance issues at all. The cooling fans only seem to come on during periods of high disk usage. Great system for the money, was a HP person but MSI forever if they keep this quality up.
Great laptop for traveling with power per dollar! I can hall this around with me in my backpack all of the town without having to worry.
I was an avid console gamer and saw no point in buying a gaming laptop. Thanks to my friends I started doing some research and did not want to go all in on a huge rig just because I was still apprehensive. Someone suggested MSI and in particular this laptop. Speed is amazing the graphics are awesome and I can run most games on Max settings. I am so happy with this purchase that I will be looking into Buying a desktop rig.
Great specs but the fingerprints because of the material used make it look disgusting, especially at night where all the fingerprints are even more visible. If they changed the material so all the fingerprints wouldn't show up, I would have gave it 5 stars. If you don't care about that and only care about the specs, then really great value.
I love it, but I bougth a pc with pci-e ssd and hdd with 7200rpm and it only has 5400 rpm :/
I have not used it that much, but so far so good. My son likes it better than his.
This is the BEST laptop that I ever had. My son has one. MSI is KING!!
Great price for a great gaming machine... will buy more for our business.
My son absolutely loves this laptop. His first major purchase
It is a good laptop that fulfills its function, I have been able to play the last games without problems, it is very fast for most of the functions, the only thing is that it heats up after a while playing, I solve it by buying a cooler base, in general all good so far
After 6 month the keyboard has keys that won't work. Doesn't seem to be a fix.
Its a great machine but has a 1 hour battery life if playing a game some games stress the gpu out and the memory runs at max fairly often but other than those small issues its perfect for its price
Beware the plug on the side of this computer. If you're the type to sit the laptop like a desktop & leave it there, you'll love this thing. Don't take it from room to room or travel with it, though - the side pin is flimsy & keeps popping out. Now it's broken; I bought a new plug for it and it keeps popping out too. I need to take this laptop to get it fixed but since I use patient information, I need to protect the files - so that means backing everything off. THEN, I get to sit this on the desktop and buy another new computer (NOT an MSI) that's more sturdy. At the end of the day, double the cost for what could have been the answer to my issues of speed & power to do what I need to do. I'll stick with Lenovo, I guess - they certainly hold up better. I also don't like the hard drive separation - who's bright idea was that? I have to remember to look in the D drive vs. the usual C drive. Yep, I'll stick with Lenovo - for the same price, I'll get a more sturdy machine & I won't need to deal with the cord.
Zero complaints, low battery life but that's all gaming laptops
Computer is great for the price. Mine has been having some issues where the video card will unmount itself from the device. But no big deal
Everything came pre-loaded on the wrong hard drive thus shortening the lifespan of the SSD, resulting in a constant warning popping up all the time.
My son is very happy with this, thank you!
Great computer, super fast and fast shipping
Great budget gaming laptop.
Best laptop I ever bought
Everything is amzing except I got one dead pixel. :(
This product is very good, Thanks :)
Itâs worth! Good enough for PUBG
Its great!!
Excellent laptop, only complaint would be the fan (on boost) is a little too loud
I wanted a gaming computer that did not break the bank. I am pleased with the computers performance so far. I have had it a couple of months now and my games perform much better on it vs my old laptop. A big reason I went with this over other comparable models was this one offered a lit keyboard in red. I know some people do not like that it's red but red doesn't mess with your eyes as much at night so I was happy they made it that color. Its bright enough to see the keys but not obnoxious or overly stimulating.
Worked fine for a month then screen started showing white blotches and keyboard stopped working. Sent it back and waiting replacement via MSI
Good computer, runs well, I have no issues with it except how insanely easy it gets splotchy and needs cleaning.
great, now addicted to gaming. Help me
Great looking unit. Highly recommended for any gamer/video editor!!
This is not a good laptop. The key pad is not good. It's been just a week that i bought it it gets stuck and gets slow. sometimes it don't repsond i get stuck in the middle of the work and my files are lost.
Runs every game I play without any issues.
Good product
Really trying to like it as it is quite an expensive computer but i just can't. This computer is a lot thinner than my 2013 Asus gaming laptop, which is great. But geez the sound of the fans is just driving me crazy, as I opened a game I could hear the fans start spinning like crazy, which my previous laptop has never done. Overall it is working good so far but ever since I turned it on the fan has not yet taken a break.. not sure how long this laptop can last as the fan may go out before everything else and consequently fry itself up.
This product has bugs. The os from time to time locks up. Digging a little I found out that the CPU this laptop uses has a mutex thread lock. It was Intel messing up again and not admitting it. I also have GS63VR by MSI which runs flawlessly and that model is one version older then this. Even running live CD locks up where it does not for GS63VR. Windows has patch for work around which is basically skip one of the cores. I recommend buy other models of MSI and stay away from this model and it's CPU
Very good for this price.
the product is what I expected, with a couple flaws. I had an issue with the graphics, on an online game. I sent it in to be checked. It seemed like a pretty simple issue to me, replace the graphics card. It took 6 weeks for the manufacturer to look at it and get it back to MSI (I thought they were the manufacturer?). They replaced the graphics card. It was fine at first, but the problem is creeping back again...idk if i should send it back in again! In general I like the notebook, it is exactly what it says it is. BUT. The support isn't all that great.
BUYER BEWARE DO NOT PURCHASEI bought this for my cousin about 3 1/2 months ago and it's having problems with over heating and one of the fans (i think the CPU fan) has started making an obnoxious and loud grinding sound whenever it's running. I've looked around for solutions, everything from bios update and ec update, to new version of Dragon Center. Nothing has worked. This seems to be a recurring issue with this laptop and MSI has not given any significant solutions besides replacing the fan. But most people have the same issue soon after it's replaced. I understand hardware failing, but after only 3 months and it being this common? Come on MSI get your stuff together. DO NOT RECCOMEND. I've had better luck with my personal ROG laptop.
DO NOT PURCHASE A MSI LAPTOP! We purchased a MSI laptop and in less than 2 years, we had to take it into the repair shop for a 2nd time. They told us we need to replace the motherboard because over half of the plastic screws (yes, cheap plastic) broke and caused the keyboard to shift and the casing was coming apart. Unreal.
i've been using it for almost 2 weeks now and i simply love this machine. Fast, comfortable and runs the programs i need really well.
My cousins bought this for me as a gift and not even 4 months of having it the CPU fan broke
Great computer have had it for about 1 month, its had no problems at all and the dragon center on it keeps me up to date with all the latest software.
Had for two months and worked fine. It started to freeze when playing a basic game and opening internet tabs.
Great Product!
I like the price on this one, it a very good value for a 1000 gaming laptop
I don't like it because defective lights on keyboard.
I don't see why this computer is getting so many good reviews. In fact, I am suspicious. I bought it to replace my 4-year-old ThinkPad X230. I barely noticed a difference. I am not a gamer but I do use programs like Sketchup which my slows down my current machine a lot. I thought a gaming laptop would be good for that. This thing just sucked all around. I had it for about 2 weeks and it was starting to crash when using Chrome,at least once per day. To top it all off, I attended an all day seminar this week and planned to be on my laptop all day. You would think a brand new laptop would have 8 hours of battery power. (It was fully charged, I keep it plugged in at home). IT DIED AFTER 3 HOURS AND 20 MINUTES. I know because I arrived at 7:45am and looked at the time it died, and it was 11:06. All I was doing on it was using MS Word and surfing the net. Not watching video. This was the last straw and it is now on its way back to the seller. (Not Amazon; I am putting the review here rather than on the seller's site because I do not want to p*ss them off while the return is in progress. But I wanted to tell others how much this purchase sucked and how very disappointed I am in this product.)
A little heavy for my preference. It does have a bigger screen, so it makes up for it.Also, it seems like is large enough to have a ten key, but they didn't include it.Everything else about this computer is awesome. It's fast and very comfortable to type on and runs programs without issues. Not too much bloatware either.I'd recommend it.
I love the trackpad, super silcky. Love the keyboard. The keyboard has good depth and feedback, and the layout is what I'm used to on my desktop.The screen is too reflective. It is fine in low light and when there is a white background (which there typically is in most apps). I do use the laptop outside, so it is usable, there are just times when the reflection is too apparent, and interferes with seeing the screen.It looks very sleek and feels very solid. When I sit in certain positions with the laptop on my lap (go figure), the edges cut into my hands or wrists uncomfortably. It doesn't happen often, but it seems very unnecessary to be so sharp.The performance is great. I have 25 tabs open right now with no problem and only 8GB of memory.
This is now my every day at home use computer. The only problem that I have is the hinge is still a bit stiff, I think this will fix itself over time.I am very happy I picked this Lap T op.
the computer arrived on time without a problem and performs fantastic. Our son loves it for college.
Love everything about the Flex. It's fast, great screen, perfect size for me.
Love this laptop and the features - touchscreen, foldable into a tablet, solid state hard drive.
Fantastic laptop. No regrets at all. Product received as expected. Excellent seller.
I've been a Lenovo fan for years because their more expensive laptops come with beautiful matte or anti-glare screens. This laptop however is not just glossy. It is more of a mirror than a laptop. I can see my reflection in the screen when it is at full brightness!It may be OK if you only work in a dim room with no windows and no bright lights.
Great laptop, a nice, clean, modern design and the screen is really nice. It's very quick to boot. Love the fingerprint sensor and new Lenovo touchpad features too. Speakers are fine for a mid range laptop, nothing special but still perfectly fine. Plenty of modern features for a laptop in this price range too
This computer is a piece of junk! I have had it just long enough that Amazon says, "the product the turn window is closed"! I will be calling them to have a conversation about this.I purchased it mostly for editing photos and transferring them to my separate hard drive for archiving. Many programs have crashed and the quality of images for editing is terrible! I wouldn't recommend buying it.
Got the 14 inch, model 81C90009US and been using since end Jan 2018. This is a super high value laptop, in that you get a ton of capability and expandability for your money while being able to run all the latest generations of hardware: 8th gen Intel i5 with 4 DISCREET cores plus hyperthreading, DDR 4 RAM, and PCIe M.2 SSD. Did tons of research, bought and returned two other models before settling on the Flex5.My situation is that I recently retired so had to give up my work laptops and get something personal. Have been a table PC user since 2004, so tablet PC form factor and functionality were a requirement. While I could afford a pretty wide range of laptops, other requirements guided me to the Flex 5, specifically, touch screen, good active digitizer, the 14" size, and the PCIe M.2 + 2.5"SSD storage options all combined with an 8th gen Intel processor. This COMBINATION of features and FLEXIBILITY is very hard to find, Lenovo really nailed it with the Flex5 at an outstanding price!Quick list of the Positives and Negatives, then more details and benchmarks below...Positives:+Tablet PC form factor (standard laptop, tent, tablet with touch and pen) with far above average performance and upgrade flexibility for the price.+Both PCIe M.2 and SATA SSD slots mean you can put a ton of very fast storage in this relatively compact machine.+8th gen Intel Core i5-8250U provides 8 total threads of processing on 4 physical cores plus hyperthreading, a very low base clock of 1.6 GHz for power saving, a 3.4 GHz Turbo for power when needed, and a nice low 15w total power dissipation for both battery life and running cool. My experience is that some generations of Intel procs are smaller steps, some bigger, and the 8th gen is one of the bigger steps in speed and efficiency.+Great battery life, I regularly get 5-6 hours, more than enough for my usage style, and very good overall for all the power on tap, display size, etc.+14" screen is the optimum size for me personally. I've owned everything from 10"-17" laptops, and 14" is the sweet spot for me. This screen is HD resolution of 1920x1080, which is fine for my use on the road or away from the desk. I've had a QHD external monitor, and that is fun, and where I'd put my money if I needed more resolution. I dock and have three HD screens, though, so that's enough for me.+Touch is extremely reliable and configurable. Digitizer for the pen is Wacom, so it is OUTSTANDING for note taking, a key requirement for me. The Lenovo Active Pen that comes with this config of the Flex5 is actually very good. I've got a drawer with about 30 different active and passive styli I've used over the years, and this is one of the better ones. It's also a good value at twenty six bucks. I bought three extras, one for each of my travel cases plus the one in the holder that slides into the usb port on the Flex.Â Lenovo Active Capacity Pens for Touchscreen Laptop for Lenovo Yoga 720, Flex 5, Miix 720, Miix 510 and Yoga 900s Laptops - GX80K32882.+Just enough ports. With three USB3 on hand, two type A and one type C, I can do most of what I want and need directly connecting to the laptop when away from the desk. See docking details under Connections, below. The HDMI port is FULL SIZE, thank goodness, simplifying connections on the road, and the SDXC slot is also full size, meaning easier connections to all that SDXC storage I have from multiple generations of cameras, etc.+802.11AC wifi built in. My home is all multi channel AC, so this is nice from a speed stand point.+Expandable RAM. I replaced the 8GB stick with 16GB CrucialÂ Crucial ME CT16G4SFD8266 16G DDR4 2666MT s CL19 DR x8 Unbuffered SODIMM Retail, provides a nice bit of RAM headroom when using demanding programs or many programs.+Finger print reader is fast, reliable, and works extremely well with Windows 10.+Backlit keyboard is a real boon in low/no light.Negatives-The screen is just barely bright enough to use in a sunlit room, and washes out when outdoors in sunlight. I have a sun room where I use the Flex5 sometimes, and have to max the brightness and be sure I don't have direct sunlight on the screen to get a good viewing experience. It's ok overall, but I would have liked a little more headroom on the screen brightness for these sunny occasions. Indoors normal lighting is no issue.-The power connector is 4.0x1.7mm barrel connector, different than the other THREE Lenovo/ThinkPad connectors I've used previously, so a bit of adapting was in order to use the 19v and 20v laptop powerbricks I already owned. Worked out, see details below under Connections.-The SDXC card slot only takes in about half of the card length, meaning no leaving a card in the slot all the time.Combined, these three negatives were not worth a whole star given the strong and almost unique combination of positives, so 5 stars from me. Highly recommended stock for the price, and as a platform to build out a high storage laptop with very good performance across the board.DETAILS:*********Storage: 5TB total as I configured it.*********I have a TON of stuff I like to keep on my laptop, and needed over 2TB capacity. Since PCIe M.2 maxes out at 2TB right now, and those 2TB PCIe drives are very expensive per GB, that meant I needed something with two storage options, OR just a 2.5" SSD option (I already owned a 4 TB Samsung 2.5 SSD and wanted to use itÂ Samsung 850 EVO 4TB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E4T0B/AM)) .With the Flex5, I decided I go with a good fast 1TB PCIe M.2 SSD as the boot drive, theÂ Samsung 960 EVO Series - 1TB PCIe NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD (MZ-V6E1T0BW), and then use my 4TB 2.5" SSD as the data drive. I imaged the included 128GB M.2 SSD to the new 1TB M.2 BEFORE I even turned on the laptop for the first time using Acronis and my desktop PC, that way, no concerns about drive Id's etc. Worked like a charm.*********Connections*********Connections on the laptop are: Power - 4.0x1.7mm barrel barrel connector for 20v power supply, 1 full size HDMI out, 1 3.5mm stereo jack for speakers. USB is 2x USB 3 type A, one type C. For a docking station I'm using theÂ Plugable USB 3.0 Universal Laptop Docking Station for Windows (Dual Video HDMI & DVI / VGA, Gigabit Ethernet, Audio, 6 USB Ports). Have this connected to the USB C port. Have a monitor connected to the Dock via HDMI, and another to the HDMI out on the Flex5, for a total of 3 monitors including the Flex5 screen when docked. I run my audio out of the dock as well for convenience, vs. having another wire to connect to the laptop. The size of the power input is different than the other THREE Lenovo types I've owned and used before, so I just bought a bunch of 5.5x2.1mm to 4.0x1.7mm barrel adaptersÂ DC Power Converter Plug, Conwork 5-Pack (5.5mm x 2.1mm to 3.5mm x 1.35mm) Tip Size AC/DC Adapter Barrel Plug Connector for Wall ChargersDC Power Converter Plug, Conwork 5-Pack (5.5mm x 2.1mm to 3.5mm x 1.35mm) Tip Size AC/DC Adapter Barrel Plug Connector for Wall Chargersand used some of the many 19v and 20v chargers I had laying around.

This is a great laptop. The screen is brilliant, with rich colors and full HD. No, it's not 4K but I have little need for that in a laptop. 8gb of RAM powers the hungry Windows 10 just fine for everything I throw at it, which admittedly isn't incredibly demanding, but I also have a laptop that crawls along on 2gb RAM in Windows 10 making for a pretty miserable experience. My daughter draws on the computer a lot with a Wacom tablet and never encounters any issues. (This computer did NOT come with the pen. We'll buy one someday soon.)Using this laptop as a kind of tablet just isn't a great experience. Microsoft really hasn't been able to nail down a good tablet experience on a touchscreen PC just yet, but it is kind of handy when doing things such as drawing as I, at least, would rather touch the surface of the drawing rather than use a Wacom tablet. But outside of that, it's best in laptop mode or tent mode for video watching.
This is a big laptop, which has pros and cons.+: the screen is really nice, videos and simple games look great on the big screen-: it's a little too big and heavy to use it in "tablet mode"It's convertible, which seems cool, but 15.6 inches at 4.4 lb is really too big for a tablet. I do use it in "tent mode" to watch videos. It's easy to get fingerprints all over the screen though when you use it in touchscreen mode.The fingerprint reader is very convenient for logging in. It starts up quickly because of the SSD. Battery life is good. It's a great laptop for general usage.The one negative is that the screen came with some air bubbles in it. It's like a line of air bubbles near the bottom of the screen, and it's actually a very noticeable flaw on an otherwise high quality screen.
After going through an "I need to get used to it" learning curve, there's a lot to love about this laptop. The keyboard was the biggest difference for me. Since there's no number pad, the letter keys are bigger, which is good. But it also means you have to position your hands just a little bit differently...a little to the right. The first few days, I kept hitting the wrong keys and made a bunch of typos. But now that I'm used to it, the keyboard is great. I like the feel and the bounce back. The touch screen works very well. It's not the thinnest laptop in the world, but it's sturdy and has a nice texture. It converts to a tablet, which makes it even more versatile. This probably has the best battery of any laptop I've used. I can work all day on one charge, and when it's time to plug it in, it charges super-fast. Another small, but nice, feature is the fingerprint sign in, which works well. I'm very pleased with this laptop and highly recommend it.
I purchased the i7 version of this laptop about a month ago. It is fast. and build solidly. However, no matter how great the specs are and how responsive it is, if you can't see the screen , it is useless. I called tech support for Lenovo a couple of times with no success. First tech tried to repair it with no success, and the second tech just said return it because that's the way the screens on these laptops are designed. It is so reflective that it is a serious strain to work for more than a few minutes in a lite room and it cannot be seen at all in sunlight.
My experience with the Lenovo Flex 5 started about a month ago. At a glance the laptop itself looks beautiful. It has a sleek design and a crisp screen that makes videos look as if you are actually there in person.The graphics of the computer, however, leave some room to be desired. This is not a laptop you will be playing games on as it barely scrapes by to make the requirements for Civilization 5, never-mind any newer games.There are a few features that I have enjoyed in the last few weeks. First, the fingerprint sensor makes logging in fast and easy. It is very reliable and almost always recognizes my fingerprint on the first try. Second, the keyboard has a comfortable feel to it. The keys are crisp enough to have satisfaction when you type while not so loud that the whole neighborhood can hear you crunch the keys (as with some mechanical keyboards.)The battery life is satisfactory, but not the best I have seen in a laptop. Keep in mind that the screen in this computer is huge, and that alone can create a strain on the battery. Those people who like to go long periods of time without charging may find themselves out of luck and stuck in the abysmal battery saver mode.Focusing now on the flex part of the product, I donât see myself using the tablet version too much. One way that feature is extremely useful, though, is for reading or watching a movie. Instead of having a heavy laptop sprawled across you (and the laptop is decently heavy), one can easily hold it in a more natural position to help facilitate hours of Netflix binge watching.Overall, my experience with this laptop has been a positive one. This laptop deserves a hearty 4 out of 5 stars, and to those inquiring into its purchase I do recommend it for students, businesses, and non-gamers.
This computer is light and has a huge screen with decent graphics that is perfect for work or streaming movies. Setup is extremely easy, you get guided by Cortana's voice through the process. After you setup an account you will be free to use your new laptop however you want. It has a an Intel Core i5 8th Gen processor that delivers quick online searches and streaming.
I financed this laptop last month only to pay it off eighteen days later from moneys saved to purchase car tires. For several days it worked like a charm until it fell from a table onto a concrete floor with my Apple iPad Pro tablet. There were no scratches nor dents on my tablet; however, my NEW Lenovo Flex 5 took a serious beating! When facing the monitor, the left corner below the keyboard is permanently bent, and the frame has buckled on that side. The speaker still works, but it is now uncomfortable to rest my arm in that area. Yet, the product now belongs to me so I decided to continue using it to learn coding and to prepare teaching engineering to high school students this fall.Based on the published description of the laptop on Lenovo's official website, I figured it can handle The Sims 4 software and the three of its expansion kits on top of my education apps- boy was I wrong! Since loading the Sims 4, the Flex 5 takes longer to restart and to process commands. The quality went from a $650 Lenovo laptop to a $199 Dell Chromebook. A total disappointment indeed! The school district invested in a $1,500 Lenonovo laptop for my engineering courses; however, the weight is unbearable to hold in one arm after two minutes. The Flex 5 was going to work wonders due to having the capability to rotate the monitor behind the keyboard to convert it into a tablet. I just have to remind myself to remove the clear keyboard cover to prevent it from falling to the ground. The finger ID makes it convenient to log on; however, the processing speed is not what I expected. I should have waited and saved moneys to purchase another Apple Macbook Air, because my 2013 laptop fell onto concrete in the past and is still going strong without any physical damages.This purchase altered my perception of Lenovo by far, and I will consider purchasing a Samsung laptop the next go round. :-(
Love my laptop, especially the extra large screen. Fast processor, quick keyboard action. The screen looks a bit whitewashed, I wish the color was more saturated. I turn the brightness up and it just get whiter. Turn it down and it gets blacker. The sound works well but the speaker are on the bottom which is strange. I never cared for the mouse on a laptop, I use a mini wireless mouse and it works great. Works great for games, watching TV, using Microsoft Office. There is one gaming website I haven't been able to work with my computer. Not sure what the problem is. I did lots of research before buying and I think for all that is desired in this laptop, it is a great buy with all it offers in screen size, storage, and speed. It also has a DVD player which I really wanted included. Compared to similar computers at other stores, most of them without DVD players, they were more expensive and I think this was a great buy for the price and features offered. If I had an unlimited budget it wouldn't be my first pick but that is not the case.
The very worst computer I have ever had, All black, hard to find the on power button or finger mouse. Everything blends in with the all black. It is a major job to find stored documents or computer ops. my 5th P,C. and the worst.
This piece of junk doesn't work. Down loaded sites won't open. WHAT A RIP OFF THIS THING IS !
Poor quality, sent the computer back
It works well but I want to be told because with the internet it is very slow. I have a good internet however it does not work fast browsing. If someone recommends something, the help will be welcome.
Computer arrived new in original packaging, when turned on it had a pink horizontal line all the way across the screen. Had to return. Amazon refunded my money and I ordered another computer.
Great product, great price, fast shipping. Excellent laptop
This is the second laptop I bought from Amazon, both were HP and better than the HP STORE tried to sell me at a better price
Happy with it so far, def worth for the money.
Works well.
I got this computer cause my other one had to go in the shop for repairs. This one is suppose to be faster, have more ram, faster processer, etc. etc. I found it much slower then my reg. one that is in the shop getting fixed. (and my reg. one is suppose to only half as fast as this one). I also suffer from a neurological problem where my muscles get very very weak the more i use them, so in typing I find the keyboard on this computer harder to push down then my other one. The screen is ok,, but not near as vivid. So maybe I"m just bias towards my old laptop, but i feel this one is not as nice a system as my older one is. As soon as my older one is out of the shop (it only needed a new fan) - I will go back to it and just store this one for another time when it will be needed.
This notebook is defective.doesn't have Bluetooth. dvd drive takes forever to load its just a messy. i purchased this product two times with the same results.dont waste you time
Great bang for the buck. Nice display. Too bad no lighted keyboard though.
Excellent computer!
Great computer just what I needed and at a good price. I like the web feature no cords needed to get on the internet
Easy to use and i love windows 10
With 16GB of ram this laptop would be awesome. With 8GB it's just Okay.
Worked great for us
Very nice laptop
Great laptop , setup was easy , easy to use . so far battery lasts as promised
I got mine at a big box store for less than half what amazon is currently charging. For sup $250 laptop, I am impressed with its specs. But the slow hard drive made it impossible to work with (My work uses Dropbox, syncing will tie up the whole machine)BUT - Since I only use it for personal things now it is a great PC.The only two real downsides to this machine are:-SLOW HDD-Dim ScreenEverything else is pretty good to be honest. It even runs Source Engine games at 25-30FPS. (Gmod, Counter Strike, Etc.)
Well built, fast and HP made. 'Nuff said !!!!! Thank you.
I purchased this in November and no problems at all so far ! This is one of the best computers I have ever had . It is A Jewel .
Laptop is amazing, but does not have bluetooth!
Te batery empty to much Quick.
its not what i expected
I purchased this lap-top because I started taking class, blue is my favorite color, and it's lightweight (puuur-fect to cuddle-up in bed with).Really happy with this laptop! It's small, easy to carry around but has all the features I need. Windows 10, room for lots of pics I'm enjoying this so much I bought one for my granddaughter. Great price too. Not for extreme gaming or anything crazy. But, for typing papers surfing the web, bulding resumes. Checking email. Even watching movies. Its great. Not a huge hard drive but it is very cloud friendly.
Last I checked, my new computer was due to arrive tomorrow 7/6 and was delighted to see it come in the mail a day early on 7/5. It was packaged very securely. No damage could have possibly happened while it was being shipped. It's in perfect condition as described and set up was really easy. It came with a free trial for Microsoft Office, which is awesome.I am a 31 year old mom, college student, and writer. I wanted something small and lightweight that I could bring with me in the living room for when I'm cramming in last minute homework or find inspiration for my novel, but don't want to leave my family to work on any of it. It's really perfect for that purpose. I haven't had a chance to explore what else I will find it useful for, but I am guessing it will be tons of things.Set up was really simple. It was out of the box at 2:14 and by 2:25 I was beginning my typical 'new computer downloads', like Chrome and all of that.Also, the color looks like a dull blue in the photo, which I wasn't pumped about, but it's really a bright fun blue and I like it a lot. In contrast with the bright white keyboard it looks really sharp.For this price, the product is more than I expected. Highly recommend.
I bought one of these used, after my old laptop got hacked and basically crashed. Really like this. The purple color is fun and I have no complaints, except I wish there was more memory. I've had it for a couple of months now and it's great. Smaller keyboard than some laptops but I easily adjusted to that. Despite being used it came in excellent, like-new condition.
This HP Stream 11 looks good for such an inexpensive laptop, battery life is excellent, and it includes a year of Microsoft Office 365 and 1TB of OneDrive online storage. The most part I like on this laptop is it does have 32GB SSD, which is fast reading speed and saving energy a lot !For me, I normally use it as my second laptop, and it does much better than Google Chrome! Love it!
A 32 GB hard drive is completely consumed by the operating system. Yes, it has Windows 10 and that's all you'll ever have. Also, it cannot apply updates to Windows 10 because there is not enough hard drive space. Get used to an error message about that every time you turn the machine on.Also it claims to come with a year of Office products, but when you receive it there is an insert in the package that says this is no longer true. They are installed, but there is no license.I like it for being lightweight and cute, but can't recommend and wouldn't buy again.
I purchased this computer for simple tasks: HTML files and to play on the internet. It worked perfectly for a couple of months. Then Microsoft updated its operating system so it wanted to update on my system. No problem. But then I started getting messages that MS could not update because I needed 8 gigs of memory (remember, this is a 4 gig machine). After a while, I decided to go buy some extra gigs. Well there is the problem. The first guy that I went to said that this was not the type of machine where you add a memory, the memory is welded in. So I got a second opinion who told me that it would be easier just to buy a new computer.Then it started doing this thing where if I try to search the internet, Windows 10 is trying to update so it interrupts and I have to push "no" don't try to install because if I push "yes" then it tries to install and errors out. It has since become slow and almost unworkable because it is not up-to-date with viruses software or whatever windows is trying to install.My point to this story is that I was sold a system with an operating system that becomes inoperable within a couple of months. In if you take the initiative to try to upgrade to the point where the operating system should work, you will be told by multiple technicians that there is nothing that they can do.
We bought this computer last October to use as a light media internet computer in Argentina. Its size and weight were the principle reasons for buying it. All was well until the large new update to windows 10 from Microsoft appeared. The 32 gig hard drive is too small. After several update that preceded the very large update that came in Dec or Jan there is literally no space left. The new large update can't install. I've tried to stop it from attempting to install,with help from a Microsoft tech support person, but it continues to try and fail. This computer is useless with the amount of space left even with removing almost every App possible. It should not be sold to anyone with out letting them know that this problem exists. When I bought it the problem didn't exist, but by now everyone should be aware of it. Don't buy this computer. There is no fix. I bought a hard drive that would take the place of the WiFi card only to find that my model had changed the connection type and I couldn't use it. I am stuck with a computer with an operating system that can't update and that has no space left on the hard drive.
HP Stream 11 11.6 inch Laptop (Intel Celeron N3050 1.6GHz, 4GB RAM, 32GB Solid State Drive, Windows 10 Home, Blue) (Certified Refurbished)Â I bought this for my 12 year old grandson to do his schoolwork. It was easy to set up and works perfectly. The size is just right and he loves the color. I would buy it again!
my boys seem to have a few issues with it... it arrived on time, was a christmas present for them... we had microphone issues, volume issues, google chrome issues... i purchased three computers at the same time and this is the only one that has issues. we work out the kinks but they happen often. was refurbished- will probably never buy refurbed again! but it gets the homework done when needed.
Don't get this if you plan on updating the windows... It doesn't have enough space.You can add space with a micro sd card however. Its fine for me but its annoying as heck every time I open it open up and it starts to download the windows update. I have to go into the task bar and shut it down every time. Its a cute little computer and I'm happy with it for just browsing the web but don't get it for anything other that and maybe writing papers on. The color is nice and the computer itself starts reasonable fast. It did come with a lot of bloatware that I had to go through and delete.
Don't buy this laptop can't run anything on there no memory. Won't let you up date, took two days to get it to run how I wanted and still goes slow. Have a hard time doing anything on here it's a piece to say the least. Never buy a computer or laptop off of Amazon.
it seems this refurbish junk last about 35 to 40 days because this is the second one I purchase and going to the junk pile since you can get a refund or replacement after 30 days ! ! do yourself a favor buy a brand new with a factory warranty !
Recently I have been on a tight budget and was looking for something very affordable. I decided to get the HP laptop. Basically because it has Windows and comes in a variety of colors. I received the laptop on a timely manner. I think it is very cute. Very beautiful color and design. I am pleased with the way it looks. It is compact but not too small. Very functional and comes with Windows 10 , Microsoft Word, and Excel. You basically can do anything.Overall I feel that this particular laptop is ideal for teens and young adults. Basically anyone if you want something a little different. I like it and so far no complaints!
nice computer very light and usable for college
It gets the job done. Emails. Internet, etc. but he operating system takes up 98% of the memory and now I need to install updates and thereâs not enough space for the updates. I have NO files saved on the PC as I use an external drive. For the money itâs fine.
Cheaply made and the casing keeps popping off. Runs very slow, very little storage and doesn't come with Word installed; had to purchase separately. Waste of money. Gave it away. Spend the extra for a good quality notebook. This is for 1st graders.
The HP Stream 11 is a stylish Windows laptop that's just as affordable but more capable than a Chromebook. Comfortable keyboard; Solid performance for this price, I got what I paid for. Best of the Best, the price is hard to beat!
This laptop does his job . I bought it just for school related work, and because is easy to Carry around. The battery can last for a long time, and is fast enough in running programs related to Microsoft office. The only aspects that i don't really like are the touchpad, and the fact that the on button sometimes needs to Be pressed more than once before working.
The size is what I wanted but everything was out dated and won't fully update. I only put 1 app on but the apps that came with it won't update fully. I know that my slow internet is part of the problem but my other lap top updates easily. This was a refurbished laptop
Within 5 minutes of being out of the box and turned on I get the blue screen of death. What a waste of money! I will never buy anything refurbished or any computer from Amazon again!
Overall I am satisfied with this product. The keypad is a bit hard to use, doesn't always click right away, but I suppose that's the price to pay for a lightweight laptop.
Easy to start up & runs pretty fast. Wasnât sure what to expect with a ârefurbished â?laptop but so far everything fast & smooth. Compact & very lightweight
Its a good computer! only problem i have is its telling me i can update the wndows 10 but then when i go to do that it tells me theres not enough space to update and theres lots of stuff already on the computer and i dont know what i actually need to keep and what i dont. I even used the disk clean up tool and the computer still tells me theres not enough space to be able to update.
Purchased for my 14 yr. old son ... he loves it, so I'm happy. :-)
I bought this for work and personal use in December. I absolutely love it, but it could come with more storage space. I don't have a whole lot of things saved onto it and I have no space left!
No memory space at all on board but basically it was like buying a $180 textbook for my son for school. Way more than I had growing up.
This was for my granddaughter for Christmas she love it
I have this laptop since April and know I can't even get into YouTube I can only get into Google and nothing else.. I even tried to factory reset and it does not even reset it always say that there was a problem.... Not happy
i love it great little computer for my needs
Perfect little laptop for a student on the go.
I am very disappointed with this product. The computer's mouse reacts like the device came with a virus already on it. The only positive things about my experience with this computer are that it a nice soft blue color and the inexpensive price. At least I didn't throw away very much money.
I am extremely disappointed that I received a laptop with scratches in a couple places. I specifically chose this laptop because what I really wanted was a pretty laptop for college. And the scratchs dont look pretty.
Really good buy, is working perfectly!
Wish it was a little faster in terms of speed. Simple and neat though.
I ordered an hp laptop a little over 90 days and it has shut down and will not power back on contact the seller and they say that my 90 period is over and there is nothing the can do
A complete waste of money; I bought it to use for photography and the hard drive filled so fast with very little content that I can't use it.
was a gr8 buy
I enjoy it each and every day
Just received today. Packaging was very good. The Laptop was in good shape. Very light and thin. I loved the design! The set up was easy. Didn't take more than 5 mins. Bought this mostly for College to take notes everyday and surf in the internet. The laptop is GREAT for these purposes. I would recommend anyone looking for a handy laptop for these purposes...Remember, this laptop isn't meant to run Games or Download large sized files. If your purpose is either one of these, than look for something else...
It's very light and the purple color is beautiful. I use it for browsing the web. Nice laptop for the price.
Bad screen
Works great
Not at all as good as I hoped. That's what I get for buying "refurbished". It's slow. VERY SLOW. Most of the time, it won't open my Google Chrome. It seems to update itself an awful lot. Which sucks because it won't let me do any thing while its doing so. its a good color and it does ...operate. and that's about as positive as I can be. I buy all kinds of things on Amazon. Rarely disappointed and never have I left I bad review. But honestly, it sucks.
I like the size and it's portability. My son likes the color.
horrible !one minute im enjoying doing my school work my music my games and the next minute the hard drive is gone!!ill never get hp again now im without a computer and have no money i spent my last on this because it was purple and i love prince i called this myprince computer well not anymore im a single mother no income!!
Excellent! Product as described. Happy with the purchase :)
is good but needs more memory in C
I had received it only a few days of purchase. I am very satisfied with it. I plan to buy another soon.
bad screen and pretty low memory..
WORKS GREAT
Just what I expected ..Love it !
I got it and tried to set it up within 5 mins it bugged out
The computer arrived on time. It's a good product with a price under $200. It got a beautiful design and the keyboard is really nice.
Bought it for a gift for and its suits the purpose
Awesome book and super fast delivery
I love it
So far my daughter is enjoying it! Brought it as a Christmas gift
Just got it yesterday. I liked it a lot. Can't tell yet if there is any problem.
DOWNLOAD LINUX. Here's the deal, bought this for gf at xmas for school..at first it worked ok.. THEN the updates were released, the hardware/storage couldn't handle Etc.. it was rendered worthess..sad gf.. I installed Ubuntu linux for 100% free and ERASED windows. Runs GREAT!!! I have used it with multiple linux distros, all worked awesome. My preference is PARROT LINUX HOME. Beginners will like Mint or Ubuntu..btw Microsoft office equivalent comes free on linux.. Libre OfficeI never write reviews but took the time because I genuinely feel bad for the owners who dont know. Really, the laptop runs ubuntu linux excellent for most every day users, for the price, you will agree. Otherwise, its headed to the garbage... just back up your stuff and switch..dont be afraid to make the switch, linux is very easy to use and FAR better than mac or windows. Plus, you can run WINE for free, it enables windows apps on linux.. no brainer.Just type the words MINT LINUX into GoogleYou will be so happy! Greatly improved speed, picture clarity, wifi and battery is soooo much better.With windows 0 stars. With linux 5 stars!!PARENTS, check out linux for kids. FREEWant quicken and other book keeping apps for FREE? Check out GNU CASH, works awesome.Nerdy? Grab an RTL-SDR for $15 and listen to shortwave radio, satellite weather images, radio astronomyWe enjoy using the hdmi port to each hd movies on our TV.Laptop is seriously powerful now.Note to parents, gamers may be still be disappointed.. $100 laptop just isn't gonna make the cut graphics wise...tell them to read a book instead.
This product physically is perfect new condition, even the packaging was great. And I guess if you just wanted to browse the internet it might be okay. I got it for my daughter, she downloaded one game (almost 1GB) and now it has no memory even to do the regular updates of Windows 10. 32GB is not enough memory when the darn thing comes crammed with stuff already
Of all the computers I've worked with over the years, this is by far the worst. It rejected passwords arbitrarily, among other things. Since both the written instructions (virtually none) and the online website were worthless. We were forced to call HP to get some help, and after being on hold for a half hour, we were told we'd be cgarged for the call! Beware!
Hello,The HP Stream was a gift for my son. It works well for the most part. However we have trouble with updates, and the laptop also Laggs.
i would like to try
is dank, didn by it doe
I am using it to write this review. Well, I will not say it has the best specs if you compare to other gaming laptops. I just want a graphics card to run little editing stuff and light gaming. 1050 2GB for heavy gaming? You can dream about it.......The speaker amazed me! It is almost the same as using headphone when I listen to my favorite music, but you have to be right in front at the computer.Overall, the performance is good; the CPU is the lastest and fast.The keyboard is quite good and comfortable.I don't really like the red line design but I rather it is plain steel.The battery can let you use about 4.5 hours if you just internet and youtube.The wifi works perfectly like the advertising. It works well even though I am a little far away from the router and have a wall in between.The fan is not noisy, and the thermal control is very good. I feel slightly warm when I am using it to light works.I do recommend you buy the SSD version though. It is quite slow when I trying to install software even though it is an SSHD.I will add an SSD later.
This thin and light notebook computer was not purchased for gaming but for work. It has the correct components for how I use it, plus, it has an 8th generation intel cpu, has room for a SSD, and for up to 32GB of ram, unusual for an ASUS, but a pleasant surprise, from my past experience with ASUS, having made three previous purchases. In my business, I am constantly downloading large files (3-4 GB) and then watching the digital footage, maybe editing it, and re-editing it. This notebook is perfect for how I use it, and it's light and seems sturdy, though the case appears to be all plastic. It doesn't have as many USB ports as I'd like, but it has enough for the price point (isn't that why they have USB hubs?) and, of course, no optical drive, but I have a nice blu-ray external drive that cost me about $20, which is small, light, and handy to carry in the carry sleeve I bought to go with the notebook. It would nice if it had a docking station of some sort, but that wasn't a deal breaker, just an afterthought. The most important lesson I learned is to read the warranty before you buy the product, because, this one is only 1 year (which I knew), will not be extended by the manufacturer, which I didn't know, (leaving you to wrestle with the decision whether or not to take your chances or go with a third party warranty company that I have found, in the past, is a useless expense and then there is also, insurance that can be purchased, but I haven't done that either or ever) and allows the manufacturer to pick up almost anything off the street to replace or repair parts that need replacing or repairing, &, if they work, then it's fixed so far as the manufacturer is concerned; they've discharged their obligation under their warranty. Had I to do it all over, I would pick a manufacturer that only made repairs and replacements with new parts, if any exist out in the notebook world, or maybe they are all like that (haven't had time to read the other warranties, yet, but will before my next purchase). Analysis at this point is that was a smart purchase and everything functions as it should, though a ram upgrade is in the near future, as 8 gigs is tasked every time I use the machine, but adequate for now. I would buy another one, at this point, because of the price point, and pray it doesn't need any repairs. However, for 3-4 hundred dollars more, maybe a better warranty and machine could be had; that extra 3-4 hundred was not in my budget so I didn't really look. I'll be back if any important updates are in order.
UPDATE: ASUS asked me to return the laptop for keyboard repairs. Turns out there is no option to purchase onsite warranty or extended warranty here in the US. The whole process could take 2-3 weeks. So I returned the laptop back to amazon. The return process was swift and easy. Watch out for the limited one year warranty, there is no way to extend that. I'd suggest looking at the DELL G3 and G5 which was just released which is way better at the same price.Delivery: Very prompt delivery. Came in a Amazon box. The ASUS box inside had two puncture marks (I've attached the photos). Thankfully the deeper puncture mark missed the laptop and went through the cardboard skirting that holds the laptop in place inside its box. The ASUS Laptop box was also placed upside down. If the whole package was kept on the floor the only thing between the ground and the laptop were two sheets of cardboard. All the air filled cushioning material was on the wrong side. It's lucky that USPS handled it carefully and nothing broke on the outside. Still a little worried about the effect that might have had on the HDD.About the laptop:This was just launched like 3 weeks before it was ordered. So I was skeptical about the initial hiccups new range of laptops come with.Pros:1. The keyboard keystrokes are sublime. And its a full sized keyboard with the NumPad. The red backlight comes in three brightness levels and an option to turn it off. (There are issues with the backlight which I've covered in the latter portion which I hope is just a defect in this particular laptop and not the whole range)2. The processor is pretty good. Almost on par with and in some ways better than the i7-7700HQ for anyone confused between the two.3. The graphics card is not that great but for the price of $699 it is sufficiently good.4. The cooling fans are very very effective but insanely noisy. Played Battlefield 3 on ultra settings and after a while the middle section of the keyboard was pretty warm/hot but the WASD area was almost at room temperature. You could feel the negative air pressure pulling air into the fan through the keys in that general area (No Idea if this is a good thing or bad)5. The trackpad has a nice feel to it but a slightly noisy click.6. The speakers are really good!7. Not a lot of preinstalled bloatware.Cons:1. The screen is FHD but just not that good. Like really bad viewing angles. Previously had a 14" TN screen that I could live with, but on this bigger screen light quantity varies a lot from the top the bottom of the screen.2. The SSHD is slow and isn't the most silent. It makes tiny clunking noises.3. Battery life is really bad. 2-3 hours is the most you can get out of this even on battery saver.4. The fans are really noisy!Stuff that might just be wrong with the device I received and not necessarily the product line:1. The backlight flickers when it is kept at the lowest brightness level. I've attached a video of it too. The flickering you see is not due to the camera but the backlights on the keyboard.2. A portion of the F9 key is not lit up. a part of the LEDs beneath the key are not lighting up.I guess I'll have to contact ASUS regarding this. Really not pleased about this.Overall it is a pretty good laptop for the cost. Another one in this range that might be as durable as this one is DELL insprion 15 5000 gaming. This one just looks way too cooler and was made for gaming.I'll add new stuff as I discover it about this laptop.
One of the best gaming laptops for the price. PUBG runs very well on medium graphics and still looks pretty damn good. Most games will run superb on High/Ultra settings. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
I bought this as a gift for relative, he loves it, uses it everyday for work and at home. It is mostly plastic except for the lid cover but doesnât look or feel cheap. The 8th gen CPU is really good as expected, the 1050 also allows to play most games at FHD set in mid quality but the display isnât as bright as youâd like. My only complain would be the lack of an SSD that would definitely improve things but again, itâs understandable for the price. The good thing is you actually got an empty NVME M.2 SSD drive slot available in case you want to upgrade.
Overall very solid laptop for its price. I've currently loved the computer as it runs smoothly and is very responsive.However, I have had a couple problems small and large. The track pad can be pretty unresponsive sometimes, minor, and the display sometimes totally freezes or black screens for no reason and forces me to restart the computer, major. This second is actually a massive pain in the ass as it can happy anytime and sometimes happen a couple times a day. Still a good computer.
The hard drive is the biggest choke point (and it's a severe one too thought it had crashed multiple times but no just locked up from the hard drive) expect to add a SSD or replace it. Other than that it's a good laptop.
very nice computer for my kid, great for school work and gaming
Well the computer is fast and is decent for its price, the video quality is very disappointing. I know it's not my internet because my other computer's video quality is fine. I updated all my drivers and programs, but still the video quality is not HD. It is even kind of fuzzy, certainly not 1920x1080 like advertised!
Its a mobile gaming demon!!! YES!!
its amazing nothing was broken when it came in and it works really good on the games i tried [it works good on fortnite but not on the highest setting but on good settings] but when it first came in the key board wasn't working so that scared me a bit but just turn it off and on and it started working
The hard drive is a little bit slow but works great for video editing. That i5 8th generations works awesome
Very poweful for the price and really nice looking.I use it for Engineering purposes and it satisfies most of my requirements.
This computer is wonderful and a great investment. Keep in mind that the computer may run a bit slow at first due to the fact that Windows 10 installs and updates the computer without verifying first. This can slow down your downloads. You also cannot download from steam and browse the web at the same time but that is a steam issue and not the computer itself. All of the games we have run very well on this computer. You do not have to turn down the graphics on any game.
Screen is quite deceiving, battery too.I don t like the feel of the mouse pad and the lack of buttons on it. Sound quality is nice. For all specs it s a good bargain despite no ssd and no the non IT version.So pretty satisfied about it.
It's a really pretty laptop. The keys feel absolutely wonderful. Currently though I am having a 100% disk usage issue (and I just got the laptop) so that slows it down a bit. Also, it feels really sluggish if you're trying to do things too quickly partly because of the lack of an SSD. I feel like once I open it up and stick a ram stick and SSD in it everything should be fine and dandy.Other blemishes: The trackpad has no protruding buttons so if you're not used to that it might be a little difficult to use. It's kind of loud when you click, and it doesn't feel like it's great quality.My perspective: This is the only laptop I've ever touched that has costed more than $300 ~ however those in that range still has a nice trackpad.

Laptop is horrible. Wouldnât recommend using this for any game because itâs extemely slow. Canât even surf the web while opening other applications such as word. Itâll have a lagging period and then work.
OK Gaming laptop for the price, but it has a bottleneck which is the 1TB 5,400RPM HDD!!! For the most part, it performs like a regular 5,400 rpm drive and mainly, when you are installing games and programs, these actions could be painfully SLOW! So I decided to clone this drive into a spare SSD, and the difference was like day and night !!! ...so if you are already used to an SSD, I strongly recommend you buy the version of this laptop that comes with an SSD already installed or buy an aftermarket one later, you'll be grateful for your decision. Other than that, the rest of the hardware is good and the laptop feels OK for its intended purpose.
I got a lemon.First off, you'll need to install an m.2 ssd otherwise this thing will take forever to boot up and install Steam Games, this thing will be at 100% disk usage without it.I had so many issues, after all the drivers were installed and updated, the speakers made a popping sound randomly. And the WORST issue was that the GTX 1050 graphics card was NOT WORKING, it was updated, and shown in device manager, yet no games used it. Yes, I tried so many solutions from the internet, switching the Nvidia Panel settings, reinstalling windows, reinstalling drivers, nothing worked. I explained this to ASUS, who wanted me to send it in, but that will take a month, which is forever, so I'll just return and hopefully not get another LEMON.
It's alright. Easy to set up. Drawbacks, black keyboard, hard to see in dim light. Reminds me of my Dodge Caliber with black interior, drop something and you can't find it because you can't see anything. HP really should have made this a lighted keyboard. Number lock button, no light. When typing password or anything, you have to pay attention to make sure the numbers are typing. Light on the caps lock but not numbers lock. Why HP?Over all, nice computer, in my second day using it. It's a keeper despite dark keyboard and no light on the number lock. Good speakers and sound.As for battery life, it was100% charged one hour and ten minutes ago and now it's at 63%. Just Facebooking and You tubing. Not good battery life at all.
Bought it to replace a Gateway with W7 and 8 gb ram, that was a real workhorse tho with Intel Core i3 (3rd gen). Boy do I miss that. This unit with core i5 (7th gen) is NOT any faster. In fact, even with its 12 gb ram I have to wait for it to get things done. I am not running a home business but just doing a lot of word processing and digital photo editing. Maybe the problem is W10 (which I do not like) being so slow. Not sure....but this may go to one of the kids and I may keep looking. In fairness to HP....it does work and I will keep trying to find out what is slowing it down.
Computer is less than 6 months old and hard drive failed, the tel number They have on Amazon to call doesn't work. They cant even get the model number or the serial number and HP Says they can not help with out the serial number and they cant find that because the hard drive is not working. I will say that Amazon Just confirmed that they will take it back and refund my money.
.This was a replacement computer for my HP as the hard drive was going. This HP is faster and easier to use. Still getting used to the new features and Windows 10. Much lighter weight than my older HP. They get better all the time. Key board keys feel different but it's easy to get used to.
Kept getting a blue screen with different error messages, microsoft sent me a link that was supposed to fix it, didn't work. Took it to local computer shop. Hard drive had to be replaced and 4 gig memory stick was bad. Would not buy this brand again.
Not a fan of the windows 10 operating system. As usual everybody has the hand in the cookie jar on pre loaded software....... Battery does not last very long imo. The main thing I like is the screen size and all the buttons are tight and respond well.
Our old desktop finely died on us so after looking and looking we bought this. I will say going from windows Vista to windows 10 was a very large mountain to climb in the the it was well worth it. The laptop works great ! Both my wife & I love it which is rare on something like this. windows 10 still out on but that is not the laptops fault.
After 4 months, both hinges are broken and the monitor is hanging. I never dropped it. My other laptop lasted 5 years. This is cheaply constructed.
I love this laptop, functions great, great price. Thank you HP for such a high quality laptop
Fits all my reasons for buying
Arrived quickly and as advertised. Very pleased with the purchase so far.
Best laptop I have ever owned.
The one I bought had a faulty headphone jack (not uncommon so I hear). Had to return.It was also $638 -- over $50 cheaper, in late Jan 18. (...A commodities industry even at the plebeian cheap layer. hmmm)
My mother is enjoying it
A very good laptop for a very good price. It handles all my needs.
This laptop was not as fast as I expected. Screen has good picture. Sometimes if freezes and you have to restart.
Pleased with this laptop so far. No complaints. It runs and looks great.
Good while it lasted. Five months in hinges broke and as a result cables were sliced.
Everything I expected and more!
Since I have had this laptop I have spent hours on the phone with Microsoft and HP as well as all the software vendors I tried to download to this machine like Microsoft 365, Mcafee. had a computer guy come to my house to help me. I was not familiar with windows 10 asked Microsoft for help they made me purchase a subscription for $59 down and $15.99 a month. Once I learned Microsoft 365 could help me with their products for free I cancelled the other subscription but they wouldnât refund my $59 because they said they did work on my computer what they did was not what I asked for and never gave me any insight into Windows 10. The Laptop came with no setup instructions or user manual when you call you have to go to support.microsoft.com to read through pages of documentation to tell you how to half do anything. I received this computer on 12/10/2017 on 12/11/2017 I fell and spent the next six weeks I The Hospital and home recovery. When I finally got the computer out of the box it was late to return so now Iâm stuck paying someone to get it to work right.
Iâm super happy with mine and the price was right for me. My old HP died and I knew Iâd have an impossible time replacing the nice keyboard and design of the lap top itself, which was comfy, fluid, etc. This is a very good purchase for me. I have too many other expenses to spend more. Picture and sound great. Called support number for a refresher on a few things. The version with less GB got 5 star reviews so I got this one.
Product Hard Drive crashed within the first (60) days. We've had nothing but issue after issue with this laptop and would not recommend purchasing in the future. Very Disappointed in the product and lack of customer support.
sick of HP charging for everything they lock it up so you have to use their premium service to upgrade i call BS and sent it back
If zero stars were an option.........I would return this paperweight if i could.
Battery will not stay charged.
Had this HP laptop 3 months before a driver failed. A $599 computer is now a piece of junk. Also only a 2 month window of support. Do not buy.
The person I bought it loves it
***Edit: the first review that you are reading was posted shortly after receving the product. The second one is taken two months later, and I recommend you follow the recent review in comparison. Originally rated 4 stars, now 3.***This the ASUS VivoBook Flip 14 m3-7Y30.Ok, let's start out with the minor faults I have found:For the 14 inch m3, there is no backlit keyboard, no finger sensor, and you are not sent the pen. I feel like Amazon made this very misleading and I find that to be very unfortunate. There are a few different version of this laptop, but I think it's best to differentiate which laptop has these certain perks, and to not advertise like it has all of them. I was really looking forward to the backlit keyboard but like I said, it doesn't come on this one.But aside from that, I am so far really enjoying this laptop. It's really beautiful, thin, and light, and I know this will perfectly fit in my backpack without straining my shoulders. The screen is a great size for watching TV shows, movies, and any YouTube video, and I think that will come in really handy. Asus did a superior job with making the bezels much thinner, and it really shows. Ontop of that, the audio is stellar, and I am blown away at the power of the sound that this little thing has! The bass can be heard extremely well, and the speakers on both the left and right sides are rich and full. I've never heard better audio on any laptop before. Finally, the laptop seems to run quite smooth and quick, even when I've got about six or seven tabs open when doing schoolwork. Starting up does not take long either. In terms of the glare, I honestly don't think it's terrible, but if you focus on it, of course it will be noticeable. I don't think it's that bad, and I still think the images appear nicely. Yes, 100% brightness on this type of laptop may not be as bright on either a Mac or even a Samsung Chromebook, but I don't mind since my eyes strain easily from a screen that is too bright. That being said though, viewing in intensely sunny places may not be the best idea. The keyboard types nicely and the touch pad is very smooth. One thing I noticed about Asus laptops from YouTube reviews is that the keyboard is very bouncy, but it is rather firm on here and there is no bounce at all. Touch screen works fine, but lags occasionally here and there. I don't know if it's because it's new, but even when using the touch screen, the screen is still very clean. I'd finally like to add that it is a very silent laptop, and it did heat up while charging, but after removing it, it was fine. Speaking of the charger, it's very convenient since it's small and compact.Overall this is quite the fine laptop for the price, and it's certainly a looker. I only wish that Asus would make laptops that have all of this plus the backlit keyboard in the same price range. I will update my review after a few months or if I find anything wrong with the laptop. For now I recommend this for any student who wants a laptop that can be used for school and entertainment. Also, this is one of the nicest looking laptops out there for a great price. Excited to see what else Asus has to offer, and I really hope they can continue expanding!***2 Months Later*** - 1 Star due to underperforming battery life and pad lagging. The main perk of this laptop is how easily you can move with it. It's light and compact, and that's a huge must for me as a college student walking along campus. The performance hasn't lagged, but I do have issues with the the touch pad (the thing you use for the mouse? Not the screen) being slow and randomly spazing out. Also the dark glare has become bothersome but can I really complain that much? I'm still bothered that Amazon hasn't fixed the description of this product, because I still long for the back lit keyboard when it gets dark, but again, it's a very minor thing that shouldn't drop a star from the door star rating. If there's one thing that should is the battery life. I'm kind of getting tired of technology telling us about this great battery life we're getting, when after doing actual work, we really aren't. Of course I have many tabs open when I work and I will watch YouTube or listen to Spotify, but I still feel like the life could be a lot better than what was advertised. I am pretty sure that I am not the only student who has various tabs/programs open. Concerning the 360 ability of the laptop... I really don't use it. Just to show people "hey look!" and that's it. If they charge more for that, that's really ridiculous. I don't use the touch screen too much since I'm not a fan of dirtying my screen, but I suppose it can be helpful when the pad lags. I will say that a good thing about this laptop is that it doesn't take long at all to turn on and the speakers. I'm still highly impressed by these speakers. But with that being said, I'm not sure if I'm going to buy another Asus laptop after this. If you're on a budget I recommend getting this for now, but if you can splurge on something pricier that has better performance then go ahead. It's crazy to say that $600 isn't a lot for a laptop, because if you ask me, that's barely how much I make in a month working part time while going to school full time... While technology has graced us, it has also burdoned us with high costs for an ultimately subpar performance. Unfortunately what can we do? It's a practical necessity as a student to have a stable computer that does x y and z. Nevertheless, I still hope that Asus will continue to improve their products. For now, this is an aesthetically pleasing and compact laptop that performs at a slightly above average performance with some cons that greatly bring it down.
After much research my wife and I purchased 2 refurbished units. 2 pc for under 500.00? What a great deal right? Well it is a great deal and a great pc!! We both are very happy with the purchase, performance and overall win with this pc. We were both looking for a 2in1 with windows os. It can handle multiple tabs open and does not slow down. The case could be a little more robust, but it's good for someone who is careful. I don't think it would handle too many drops. Overall, another great Asus product at a great price. Edit: donât miss out on the Realtech audio settings, go in and adjust and trying different sounds themes. The sounds volume and quality are quite impressive, just another bonus!!
Very thin amazing look. the color isn't shiny nor matte just brilliant. This model does not come with the Asus stylus pen which is the only con I had to purchase separately around $50. but the price for this is great. Aside from no stylus included worth the money for such an awesome laptop. Bravo Asus and Amazon!!
This laptop really performs well for the price and is a better option for me vs. Chromebooks in a similar price range as it also of course runs full windows apps. I've read some negative reviews concerning the screen but I'm guess they must be referring to the HD version (1366x768) and not this Full HD version (1920x1080 ie. 1080p). The screen looks very decent and I'm very happy with performance of the m3 proccessor. It's also a great looking machine, feels very well made. In my opinion, the look and feel reminds me of the new Macbook Pros, at a fraction of the cost.The only 2 gripes I have are that the keyboard isn't backlit, and that I can't charge the laptop via USB-C, like with the Asus Chromebook C302CA, for example, but I still prefer the bigger screen (14 vs. 12.5 inches) and just purchased an extra power adapter so that I can leave one at home and one at work.Edit: I forgot to mention that in flip/tent or tablet mode, you can of course type right on the touch-screen in the dark, regardless of the non-backlit keyboard, and it also includes a stylus if you want to avoid fingerprints on the screen!
I bought this laptop because my iPad got stolen and figured why not just try a laptop to be able to type excel sheets and do basic office stuff. Itâs pretty cool how it turns into a tablet. The screen is big and you canât beat the price
Wifi connectivity issues. Does not reset to default. Had to ordered a replacement
Low screen quality, low light, otherwise it's good!
Received today. No complaints so far. I will update my review if things change.
It does not come with any adapters to convert the smaller ports (micro usb and usb-c) to standard usb ports. The viewing angles is pretty bad, about 90 degrees total left to right or up to down (45 degree from center any direction) loses color then coherency.
In my experience the 2 - 1 laptop meant that it detaches like a tablet, but this new version from ASUS really makes the 2 in 1 laptop experience a lot better. It does not detach like older models but rather stays together and flips 360 degrees due to its all metal hinge. The touchscreen acts like a tablet when you flip it all the way around or if you are browsing web pages you can simply swip up and down. There is no stylus but i dont mind. The screen is very bright and the touchscreen is really fast and responsive. The hard drive has plenty of room and the RAM handles everything I need to do. I am very happy with the keyboard too it feels really nice. The build quality is also good to. It feels like a much more expensive laptop than the price suggests. I get compliments from everyone who sees me use it, even at the airport. Ive never had a stranger ask me what laptop I am using till this one. I highly suggest you give this a try you will love it like I love it. Great laptop.
Can't get passed the horrible display. No backlit keyboard, one can get over. But a non-IPS display panel is inexcusable in a laptop that is a 2 in 1 where it is supposed to be usable as a tablet; I think not. A big waste of time; had it for less than a day. Once I saw the real world viewing angles of the display I knew I had to return it. A great looking device would have been perfect if not for the horrible display panel.
Very impressed! For the price and the features this thing really is great! I love the fast performance and the sleek body style. Honestly when I got the box I was like "o boy" another potentially boring laptop from ASUS, but man when I opened the box and got that new computer smell and turned it on i love it. The keyboard feels super nice, the track pad is big and is very accurate, and even the ASUS logo looks super high end. I also like how the speakers played music from youtube, and the online web browsing was fast out of the box. Overall this thing is great and I plan to use it a long time. Great fit and finish, great quality overall. I maybe wish the box it came it looked better, but then again its in my garage now collecting dust. Great touchscreen and great experience so far. VIVA the VIVOBOOK!
I use this for my small business where I have to go to clients and show them pictures for landscape architecture. It is great because of the touchscreen because I can zoom in on examples and show them what others are doing. Also I have to go house to house to see potential clients and the battery life is really good. I can go all day and not have to charge. Also its lightweight and is easy to carry around. This laptop is great! Love the 360 screen that can flip.
WHOA!!!!!! SUPER NICE! This laptop really impresses me. The 360 hinge is super strong and goes all the way around. They touchscreen display is also really bright and sensitive like a high end tablet. The only thing I would say I would have liked is maybe different colors, but this color suits me just fine. Overall this is a great value. I use it everyday to browse the web, check email, and use office. I dont do any gaming or video editing. I have yet to travel with it, but once I do I can update the review if anything comes up, but for now its great.
powerful & light, works great
I bought it for my son who is an animation student..he said it is perfect for school...just a bit heavy...but he liked the screen size.
So far...so good! I just wish I had gotten a smaller screen. Apparently, the larger screens come with a keyboard with the numeric keypad which I really did not want. I'm always putting my hands on the keyboard in the wrong spot because of the numeric keypad, but that's my problem. For those of you who like the numeric keypad, the keyboard is really good. The keys are very responsive. The screen is beautiful and the computer, too! The touchscreen is not something I'm used to using so have not really tested it...so no comment on that! Overall, it is a really good computer!
Horrible purchase. I gave this to my son on Christmas to use for schoolwork. I noticed he stopped using it after a while. I decided to take a look at it. It is almost non-functional. It really doesn't do anything. It takes 15 minutes to start up (seriously). If I click on the settings icon, that window takes 15 seconds to open (at least). It freezes constantly. It won't let me install windows updates. I have been trying to run the "Reset this PC" function as a last resort. This is my second Dell computer and I had bad luck with that one too. I will never do this again.
Very happy with my purchase of the Dell Laptop
This computer is so loaded with unneeded Dell software, Windows 10 apps, and McAfee services that it runs at about a tenth the speed of my ten year old desktop with Windows 8 Pro.I advise you don't try to save the extra $100 and go for something with an SSD. After about ten hours of Windows updates and uninstalling garbage it finally boots and logs in in less than 5 minutes.Tldr; Don't buy this. Two stars because the hardware is good even though it arrives with a terrible configuration.
I absolutely HATE this computer. The keyboard is hard to type on. Typing on a document disappears and I never know what I touched to cause it. I wish I could return it for credit and purchase a laptop. Anything but a Dell. Never again will I purchase a Dell.CAN AMAZON HELP ME TO RETURN THIS FOR EVEN PARTIAL REFUND?
Avoid. I purchased this late last year and had nothing but issues from day one. I was finally forced to go through the process in Windows 10 to do a "reset". After four hours of the process wiping and reloading Win 10 I went to boot it up today and it is looking for a Bitlocker recovery key although the device was never set up with one. Microsoft hung up on me when I explained the problem. Yes literally hung up after saying in an Indian accent "call Dell". Dell is basically giving me the runaraound suggesting a buy a new laptop. I will and it won't be a Dell.... ever again.
Bought this laptop for a friend of mine who is a high school teacher. It's very light-weight yet powerful for her needs. If you're a power user, this will probably not be for you. But it's good for Office, web browsing, powerpoint presentations, etc. I wish it had a solid state hard drive option. That would have pushed it to 5-star territory.
Works okay, still trying to figure out how to make it start up faster. Too much junk on it for me. I am thinking of dumping it all.
This is the worst laptop I have ever owned. It's slow. The touchpad is unresponsive intermittently. It locks up while doing something in the back ground that you can hear the drive moving, but gives no indication what the hell it is doing. I've tried everything I can to speed this thing up. I about to throw it out and try something else. I would have sent it back, but I ended up having to have surgery and the return time ran out.
I don't know how to rate this laptop, since it arrived damaged and did not work. The packaging was at fault, not Dell.
Battery life is subpar. & Dell has annoying reminders trying to get me connected to their stuff. Can't figure out how to turn them off after a year of using.
It's fast, reliable. I use it for basic home office stuff...emails, office suite, and some streaming and music. I love the touchscreen feature.
everything was as expected, perfect!
Screen went out in less than a month!!!
Went dead after 4 months. Before that when I would sign it sometimes refused my password. Took over 4 times of powering down and back up before it would recognize my password. This happened a number of times. The price was good if it lasted.
Bought it on December 4th as a gift to my sister, brought the computer to Brazil. My sister noted that the computer was extremely slow, when she took to a repair store, they identified that it was defective. Over $400 dollars wasted on a broken computer!
I purchase two Dell laptop computer from you one on Nov 1,2017 and the other one on Dec 2017on the one purchased in November it has a green and purple screen and the computer repair shop can,t fix iti need some help with this
Grandson's Christmas present. He uses it constantly.
works as expected......good so far
Love it does what I need.,
Pricing was fair. This one better last through the college years!
fantastic lap top
Computer is great, the shipping was horrible! Box came opened and with zero padding. Thankfully the dell box was padded
Met expectations on all levels. Easy PC for my wife to use. Love the touch screen. WiFi works well through our home.
My granddaughter loves it!
It arrived on time and my son is very happy with it. I like that it's touchdcreen. Works very good.
Item was just what I need and described
It did not include a charger
Works great
Love the touch screen it's so cool
For a stripped down software computer with lots of power, this is the best bang for your Buck!
this is a very good, state of the art laptop for an incredibly low price...I scored
Battery lasts long. Touch screen works great
It was a gift and they were very pleased. Wish I would've bought me one also
just what my husband needed
It says 2017 but when you go through the computer its actually 2016 runs pretty well
Mistake? I got a HP instead of a Dell Touch-screen.
Had a hard time operating
It"s okay for the price.
Screen flickered we had to send back
Good enough computer for what I need it for - mostly photography editing. Microsoft adds endless garbage to the system that needs to be removed along with their constant pop ups to buy apps, etc. They have a captive audience for their constant advertising. Get sick of all the constant bells and whistles from them. Wish I had realized that the keyboard does not light - major disappointment, but good enough aside from that.
This laptop is very handy and light and good for student of College (was for my sister) Ans Dell is good (Windows 10 very easy to work with)
It worked OK but was big and HEAVY. I also found Wndows 10 difficult to use. I returned it and bought a MacBook Pro.
Gift for wife to replace her outdated Dell a month ago. After 30 days constant use as an Insurance Agent She absolutely loves every feature.
Having an issue with this laptop not working. The disk space is always 100% after opening any application. Will need to download new drivers.
Good quality and speed, features for the price. Touchscreen is nice unless you have kids who keep touching it!
just like they described...... a good computer for the price........
Awesome laptop.
Excellent !!....
It crashed the same first day it was programed losing evefything
Purchased this as a 64-bit replacement for a 10-year-old 32-bit Dell XPS to dual-boot Win10 and Xubuntu Linux (anticipating Linux's drop of support for 32-bit machines). Using primarily as an HTML-coding, writing, and internet research computer, with occasional light photo editing. Xubuntu 17.10 (ver 4.13 of kernel) loaded flawlessly with no Wifi, trackpad, or touchscreen issues (a Lenovo I tried had Wifi problems with Xubuntu 16.04, and trackpad problems with Xubuntu 17.10, touchscreen not evaluated). i3 CPU is sufficient for anticipated use. 4 stars for working well with Xubuntu Linux and including 1TB drive and 8GB RAM, 1 star deducted for cheap feeling "integrated" trackpad buttons (I prefer dedicated buttons, rather than corners that depress to click). Win10 took awhile to set up (typical I'd say for Windows), and takes longer to boot than Linux, but considering it is primarily used for Linux, no stars deducted for it.
I've had nothing but problems. Bought it for Christmas and have am already trying to return it, but now can't get a hold of the seller. Latest problem? It says there is NO Hard Drive! It is no small issue, total piece of garbage.
Blue screen multiple times a day. Dell tech "support"was of absolutely worthless
since we have had this computer the screen has blanked out a few times, it takes several reboots to get it back, we are worried we will lose all of our information.
This system has a lot of issues.
this computer is from 2017 not 2018 but other than that got what i paid for
this is a very very slow computer ... the Celeron chip slows everything way down. I would suggest that a buyer would upgrade a little to get an Intel chip.
Battery did not work. Dell help line was no help. Had to send it back to Amazon.
So far so good. I really was not aware of all the features it has to offer. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.
I am very disappointed with this laptop. I find it difficult to use and would not buy another!
After 2 days got the error message "Your PC did not start correctly". After I ordered it, a couple of knowledgeable friends to me Dell has been unreliable. Wish I had known before I ordered.
The laptop is awesome. I am happy and satisfied with my laptop.
It is inconceivable to me that a computer this slow is in production. It literally took me TEN MINUTES from the time I typed Amazon.com into the browser window to the point that I got here to write a review. (It is NOT an issue with my internet speed.) Just abysmal.
I got this laptop in early may and now it doesn't work , is it to late to return it ?
I received a computer with AMD processor how could that have happened
Great laptop.
This laptop is slower than a slow death. If you are going to use it for anything other than a dust collector DO NOT BUY it. It DOES NOT like running Flash - so if you play FB games powered by Flash, prepare to pull your hair out. Hopefully I can return it and get my money back. Although, for $300 I guess i got what I paid for.
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THE COMPUTER BECAUSE IT DID NOT HAVE THE POWER ADAPTER WITH IT. VERY VERY IRRITATING.
Volume was not working. I called Asus support 2 days after receiving my laptop. They said I probably needed to add some additional drivers or get some driver updates. They would help me only if I bought an ongoing support contract with them. I refused. Told them I had it for 2 days and it is a brand new machine and that they should support it. Their answer was that because I bought it from Amazon it was not their problem. They would have done it for me at no cost if I had bought the laptop directly from Asus. Horrible way to run a company so I returned the item and am looking at hp laptops.
Great great great laptop. Love it, strong upgrade from my aging Core i3. I followed the popular recommendations to purchase the 128GB SSD along with the 1TB hard drive. Very fast, nice screen, like the fingerprint sensor. Here are the shortcomings that keep it from a 5.1) Power key is located within the keyboard up at the top right corner. It is adjacent to the often used Delete, Backspace, and Home keys. Really? This passed their use case criteria? I often miss the Delete or Backspace keys and am accidentally putting my laptop into sleep. Several decades of best practices in designing laptops has led to this? Sigh. Deep. Sigh. Found the workaround at a CNET article. Since Amazon won't allow URL's in reviews, just Google "Asus Vivobook power button" and it will be the first link.2) Keyboard is not backlit. This should be a simple feature addition that is minor in terms of cost. Merely an LED and a light tube. Would have been worth a few extra buck were this to be included in their bill of materials.3) No Ethernet port. Sometimes it's necessary to be hardwired into a router to configure things.
Within the first few days of getting used to my laptop the monitor died and I had to send it back to ASUS. ASUS customer support was through CHAT and cumbersome. After a week, they sent my computer back to the wrong address and it was ridiculously complicated to finally get the laptop back.It has worked well except for an initial hiccup on turning it on. Now a few weeks later monitor has died AGAIN.Not worth it. I will return it.
This computer is fantastic. I did a lot of researching looking for laptops in varying sizes (13.3, 15.6, 17.3). I was looking for an SSD and i5 8th gen CPU, and at a great price. After arrival this computer easily beat my expectations. The computer is super fast (thanks SSD) and has no problem running large excel spreadsheets and access files. I looked at more expensive laptops and almost pulled the trigger on the $750 Zenbook. I'm more than happy with this "Cheaper" alternative that all of my needs. SSD, 8th gen i5 CPU.. Laptop is super light and slim too which makes it ultra portable
The laptop seems okay until I tried to connect an external monitor via hdmi. The screen flashes for a second every 30 seconds or so.I thought it was a bad hdmi connection. So I did the process of elimination.tried multiple cords, screens and tried my old laptop with those screens and cords. This laptop will not work with any of my monitors or TVs. I reinstalled drivers, used the backup, tried to troubleshoot it as best I can so far nothing.This is a new laptop and shouldn't do this! I will be returning...
This computer is great. I am very satisfied with it and i would definitely recommend it, especially for the price!The good: It is SO fast. The solid state hard drive boots up windows and the start up programs in about 20 seconds. Browsing and navigating is lightning fast. The screen/ display is amazing. Full HD and very bright. The battery life is awesome, way better than my last laptop. This laptop is very lightweight and portable.Only bad things; One month after having it the videos stopped playing and i was getting error messages. Long story short, I needed to update my sound drivers and now it is working fine. The other thing is left clicking on the mouse pad isn't the best, but it works. This is easily solvable by getting a wireless mouse. All in all, I would definitely recommend this laptop, especially over the others that I have had and used.
I've had the Vivobook for a week. I love this machine. I have hhr combined SSD and 1 TB HD. I did my research on the specs and this is the best value I could find for the money.The machine booted up windows 10 in exactly 10 seconds! After I set up my fingerprint scan it does the fast and easy boot up every time. I am surprised by how fat it is.So far it's completely silent. No fan noise no HDD boot up noise, nada.I would suggest that you see the YouTube reviews of the machine, the keyboard is a bit plain and the build is plastic, but for me it is just fine.I love that I can upgrade it and both the memory and the SSD and this will be by far the best machine I've ever owned. I am happy with this purchase, and I think you will too.
Wife and I were looking for a solid at home laptop that can be used for work if necessary. Saw this was Amazon's Choice and popular laptop. After reading the reviews and recommendations, bought Crucial 8GB Single DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) DR x8 Unbuffered SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT8G4SFD824A. This is a quick laptop and thankful for all the helpful recommendations.Once the computer was set up, make sure the change over where new files were being saved. Outside of that, fantastic laptop and would recommend to others
Love every aspect of this, except there is no backlighting for the keys. Didn't even think to check as every laptop I have had came standard with it. With that said, it is light weight, fast, nice display, chicklet keys. Don't miss not having a number pad since all of the models with the pad have the touch pad off center. Over all very pleased with this laptop. Definitely 5 star but dropped to 4 due to the lack of backlighting
So I just got this laptop this month, so it's still early on, but so far I love it. I needed a new computer because the screen on my old one was on the fritz, making me not exactly want to use it. It's amazing having a fully functioning laptop again. The setup on this is easy to do, they even walk you right through it. It's really quick (especially compared to my old one) and I'm loving the fingerprint scanner. I realized a few days into using it that it doesn't have a number pad like my old one, but I'm accommodating to get around that- it was mostly the minus key I'm missing so I can quickly add things like em dashes while I'm typing in Word. So far so good. I'm so happy I went with this laptop versus any others I had been looking at. I may be developing a brand loyalty here; my old laptop was Asus, too, and it lasted me quite some time.
I purchased this laptop on the 11th of June 2018 and today is the 25th, which means I have had it for just about 2 weeks.I noticed yesterday that the laptop was not charging anymore for reasons I cannot deduce. It appears the adapter may still be good as there are a few sparks when plugging into power but the charging light on the laptop does not come on and the battery is not charging. I have plugged and unplugged but to no avail.I will attempt to return it as I am out of the US right now.It is quite disappointing. I have used other ASUS products in the past and that was what informed my decision to buy ASUS. I am really concerned that this was not strongly made and just pretty. ILet's hope returning it goes well.
I'm very satisfied with this laptop. Being so thin and so light, yet is has a build quality that I think rivals others in the price range. An 8th Generation Intel i5, 8GB of RAM, and a 1080p display that's vivid and crisp, paired with speakers that aren't that bad and chiclet keyboard that's responsive?Yeah, I'd say it's a pretty good piece of tech for the price.Battery life is pretty decent. It's listed at 8 hours, but of course depending on how you use it that will vary. Having USB Type-C is a nice touch, as well as USB 3.0 ports. Of course for me, the 8GB of RAM it comes with is enough, but it's a little "future proofed" with the ability to add more, which is always a plus. My only gripe is that it doesn't have a dedicated graphics card, but it can still handle some less demanding games.I'd definitely recommend this to anyone trying to upgrade from an older laptop, or just someone who wants a good all around laptop in general
I've owned this laptop for a week. The laptop is as advertised. The screen display is great, the laptop is very thin and light, easily fits into my bookbag at 15.6". It came with 128 GB SSD and a 1 TB HDD drive. The Intel Core i5-8250U is awesome; although, I think I would be a little more comfortable with 16 gb of ram and a little more solid state storage (256ish) to make it run just a tad faster, but I can't complain at all for the cost. I haven't done anything too strenuous, but I like to have a little extra room for hardcore multitasking and/or gaming since I'll be starting graduate school in a few days. Windows 10 feels fresh with their updates. Heck, I might even use Edge. Just kidding. I love is the fingerprint scanner. This is my first laptop with a fingerprint scanner, and on this ASUS it's very fast so that is convenient. The laptop has been very quiet, and hasn't heated up on me yet. It feels very nice holding it in my lap because there is plenty of space for the palms of your hands to rest while you type if you're leaning back.The keyboard isn't amazing, and I haven't used the webcam yet. At first, the touchpad was very irritating as it kept flipping on and off, but a quick download of the SmartGesture driver fixed that. The whole touchpad never turns off anymore, but very occasionally I lose capacity to scroll with two fingers, in which cases I have to click the scroll bar to scroll. The speakers on this laptop aren't loud at all at max volume, but that isn't that high of a priority to me, in a few days when I'll be on campus. With any Windows computer I have to delete some unnecessary things before I use though. This one wasn't any different but it didn't take long.All in all, my budget was $800, but I was sold on this $600 computer. To me, with the 8th gen processor and only 3.7 lbs, this was an easy choice if you value portability and performance on a budget. If you don't care about the portability, the Acer Aspire E 15 gives this laptop a very good run for its money at the same price. But at over 5 lbs I had to turn my head.
Good performance, portability, display and wifiOther pros:Quiet fan even under loadMatte display works well, has good viewing angles, and remains fairly color-accurate, if not exceptionally brightCons:Keyboard is not great (rattles, bounces, feels cheap)Webcam is garbageFeels like all-plastic construction, though I was under the impression it was metalSomewhat flimsy chassis
This is a great laptop that boots and is logged on in under eight seconds (if you use the fingerprint scanner) and launches apps lightning-fast. Battery life is four hours. Cons are that the keyboard is not back-lit, there is little key travel, there is no physical indication that caps lock is on and there is no number pad. If you don't mind those things, put some serious thought into buying this laptop.
I just got my new laptop in the mail last night, and I am very happy with it so far. I read the reviews before I bought it, and I think a lot of the reviewers bought the version of this computer with just the regular hard drive. I sprung the extra ~$90 for the 128 gb sold state hard drive. When I plugged in and started the new computer up, I found it was very fast. So far everything is working very well, and I am happy with it. For this budget price, I think this is really an excellent buy!
I am truly enjoying this laptop. The only drawback (a small one) is that it does not have a port for attaching a wire for internet connection. The wireless connection works just fine, but when I am at my desk, I would have liked to hook it up for a faster better experience online.
Pros: Lightweight and looks nice. Period.Cons: No "Caps Lock-On" indicator. No backlighting on the keyboard. I bought it because the SDD was supposed to make it blindingly fast but it CRAWLS. (I had to check that the Caps Lock was off after typing that last word.) My 10 year old Toshiba laptop runs rings around the Asus. Since it came with no user manual, I had to call Asus customer support and got someone who knew all about Windows 10 software but nothing about my Asus notebook. For the backlighting, he sent me some zip files for ATK and Chipset which I don't know how to use and which I shouldn't have to use. I hope someone from Asus is reading this because otherwise this needs to go back!
Absolutely love this laptop. Fast boot, runs for 8+ hours on battery. Use for CCTV MANAGEMENT, Sage Accounting Software. No backlit keys but keyboard is sturdy built. Uses ssd for OS and apps and HDD for data. Highly recommend. This unit does not come with an Ethernet port.
Good laptop. It opens quickly. Amazon packaging was not good. Laptop wasn't stable inside the box hopefully working great. Don't use onedrive option it wastes %25 of your cpu power. If you open it just close it.
Other than backlit keyboard, every other specs are very satisfactory with this price.. Screen is very crisp and CPU speed is very fast. Furthermore, the thickness of PC is also very ergonomic for typing. I am using 3 asus laptop. Overall, Asus laptop give excellent experiences..^^
Nice, lightweight laptop. This new laptop was packed well and is in great condition. No scratches or anything sticking out of the laptop as some other reviews have mentioned. Initial setup was super easy. I will use this for internet surfing, watching videos, creating and updating documents via Microsoft Office and maybe some games. I will update this review as I start to use it or if I encounter any issues or errors.
Definitely an improvement from my last computer it is pretty fast and has not that much bloatware. It works well but the keyboard is my biggest issue. There are a couple of keys that you have to push two or more times to get them to type correctly. You never knew how many times you needed the "L" key until you type a whole sentence without it.ASUS VivoBook F510UA Thin and Lightweight FHD WideView Laptop, 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8250U, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 128GB SSD+1TB HDD, USB Type-C, ASUS NanoEdge Display, Fingerprint Reader, Windows 10
Good buy! It would be nice if this model had the backlit keyboard. Without the SSD, maybe it's not so good (when i access the HHD too much it's kind of slowish, plus it gets a little warm where the right hand sits). It's vere light.Cons: sound is too low (really, tooo low). Screen is good, but in a very bright ambient is not bright enough
What I like about it is that having a Solid State Drive means that starts quickly and having 8GB RAM means that it operates fast even when numerous programs are running and when memory hungry programs are running. What is a minor issue is that the fairly heavy power supply plugs directly into the power point meaning that the extra weight can cause the power supply to come loose easily. It would be better to have a short cord between the plug and the power supply so that this looseness doesn't happen.
Pros: - Because the operating system runs on an SSD, this PC boots up in 5 seconds which is extremely fast! - Very good looking. - Super light - Excellent screen quality. - Good sound. - Good battery life (8 hours)Cons: - Come with no num keyword. - Not a touchscreen pc. - Keyboard and mouse pad feels a bit like a toy. - Does not include MS Office.
Very disappointed in how slow it seems. I guess that it is ok. Keyboard and mouse pad seem fine, but overall it seems strangely SLOW. Plus the screen is bland.
I kind of feel bad about the fact that it does not have a graphics card or a backlit keyboard, but for this price, this thing is a treat!Absolutely no performance issue and screen is amazing, though I am starting to get a hint that this screen might not be exactly a Full HD screen even though the system says it is...I had it delivered to me to New Zealand, and though it was stuck at the custom, it was delivered to me at the initially estimated time!
I'd say the best affordable laptop out there: powerful, fast, sleek looking and perfect in every aspect. Bought the one with an ssd included, this laptop is awesome for work, couldn't be more happy.
Have had the laptop now for about a week and love it. Use it for browsing, listening to music, programming, and school work. The look and feel remind me a lot of my old 2011 Macbook Pro. If you're going to get this laptop, you absolutely must pay the extra cost for the SSD combo as that what makes this a really good deal.
Initial impression:Pros:- Sharp, FHD screen,- Fast 128 ssd hard drive, plus a 1TB rpm storage.- Light and thinCons (no big deals to me though):- No caps lock light- Keyboard doesn't feel premium- Poor webcam quality
It's a great little laptop, but I miss dvd player and keypad...It runs great and I've had not problems with it.
Excellent Value. For the money this is one of the best deals out there. Great speed, lightweight, good battery life, and screen is crisp and bright. Glad I didn't drop three times the money for something that I wouldn't notice a ton of difference in.
I absolutely love this one! The screen was most important to me, and it's simply the sharpest I could find in this price-range (it's IPS).It's quite light and compact, for a 15" .Like other before me, I'm glad I included the SSD option, and strongly recommend it.Note it's not supposed to be a gaming computer, but for general purpose I found it excellent.
Just received the laptop today and I have it in my vehicle. I'm always out on the road and bearly home so it's nice to set my phone as a hotspot and start studying. This is a upgrade from my laptop made in 2011.
The M key popped off during initial setup. Amazon is 2-day shipping me a replacement. Will update again when the new one lands.
Great laptop. Perfect for online classes. Very happy with this purchase. I would recommend for college students or for people who need to travel.
works great
Overall Grade: C (For Me, read Consideration)Great For: Travel, light duty work, lightweight, headphone usersPros:Light Light Light (like a spiral notebook light)compact chargerBattery is all day amazingscreen is amazingthin bezels allow for a compact frameram upgrade AvailableWith SSD Lightning fast start upHard Drive upgrade availableCons:Plastic Build/ Durability (for Me read below)Keyboard FlexNo Back Light KeyboardAudioHeatperformance is mediocreOverall this is a good system for the price and I do recommend the SSD for the price. But my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises, both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk. Even when I was watching YouTube or streaming Netflix this thing kicked up immediately, even with low settings and the battery saver mode on. The performance for the build seems lacking and struggled with 3 explorer windows open and one excel file while I was doing research and nothing in the background. Which you should be able to run with an I-5, I could accept this if it was an M3 or bottom of the bucket system but not with this.Consideration: If you are of average frame and strength then this build will be perfect and the keyboard flex and body is the perfect fit between lightweight and rigidity. My friends, both female and male, are going to by this set up for their travel needs but for me it is lacking. Please take in consideration that I stand at 6' x 255 and have a combined total of 1600 + on the big three lifts in power lifting so I am large and strong. This adds to my need for a strong system and willing to sacrifice some weight for strength. Also I do a lot of research as well as build systems so this may be my over expectations kicking in just a tad, if you are coming from only using low end systems this is probably a half grade up (C+ or B) systemBest For: If you are looking for a travel laptop and are planning on doing light work this is an amazing buy for the price. Not only is it light the battery charger is tiny and with the thin bezels this is a super compact design. Even with the fan and heat if you use a cool mat on your lap you will be find especially with the screen being amazing for the price. And with all the ports available it is hard to go wrong.For the price it is an amazing starting point and hard to beat especially with such an amazing brand such as ASUS. Always loved ASUS and they build amazing machines. Oh and this is a BEAUTIFUL machine and the lid is amazing. I am just going to save for a step up. If you can save for 750 - 800 I would recommend going up a bit in the ASUS line.
Dead pixel on display on arrival
really good laptop.
My first bad experience on amazon. The laptop doesnât work. Wonât charge. Iâve tried every single option and still canât use it.
Excellent... Wife loves it.
Great product for everyday use if like me you dont like browsing the internet with a tablet or phone. I dont game so not sure how this would be on the latest games.
Great features and value
Wife loves it smokes
Muy bien
This is a great laptop with a good amount of speed for what I am using it for. This is the laptop I use for school and it has met my expatiations and some, I recommend picking up some extra DDR4 Ram just to beef it up some as it has the room internally to do so.
Good and as mentioned. Yet to fully use it to test it out
The hdd has to take some time to spin up, making everything wait for it (not sure if the user can tell it to spin constantly).The ssd works like a champ.The reports of a 4hr battery life are true.
I Love this laptop!The SSD makes this super snappy and the display is super sharp. I did a LOT of research before pulling the trigger on this one, absolutely no regrets!
Perfect light-weight computer for work. No known issues so far. The speakers aren't the best, but I use a headset most of the time anyway. Looks cool.
I like the fingerprint sensor most.it stars very fast like within 5 to 7 second..it's so smooth and very fast and bettery life is awesome and its last for 10 hr..Finally I recommend this product to everyone who has budget is around 600.
This laptop is of amazing quality, internally. What I mean by that is this: if you want a fast and reliable laptop, you found it! This will get work done in a blink of an eye. The only downside is that it is not made of the highest quality material. The keyboard and touchpad feel a bit cheap, however it's understandable with the price. If you were to weigh you options, I think this is the best middle ground: Fantastic price for speed and quality. Definitely recommend.
Great HD display, lightweight, fast, and stylish look. The speaker is not that loud though. Phone speakers are louder. Overall though, this is a great computer and good price. Very happy!
LOVE this laptop! Perfect for my business and personal needs ! Light and powerful...perfect !
Great computer. Not a fan of Windows 10, but with some "hacks" was able to get it operating to my liking.
I have had this computer for a little over a week and it has performed very well. The SSD upgrade was a great decision.
Excelent PC and very good price. The screen is marvelous.
This computer is LOUD! The fan blows like crazy and it makes so much noise. It sound like having a white noise machine on. I don't even think I will be able to work on this it is so distracting.
It is amazing ... high speed and slim ..
Came in great condition, perfect for me and my gaming needs
Fantastic laptopp, I dualboot Ubuntu and Windows and it is such a great machine, especially if your'e in school like me.
i love this laptop
Starts fast and has been great so far....
A lot of great computer for the price! Fast and responsive processor with no lags. The only drawback is the lack of a back lit keyboard.
A relative small(14) main body with a large screen 15.6. Light enough. Runs quickly. I like it.
It's a great computer for work. Works with light graphic games too. Wish it had Ethernet cable but what you're getting for this price can't be beat
Worth for money, nice configuration. i dont like the keyboard. but over all i am satisfied
Battery Life is only 3.5 hours after full charge with battery saver on.
It is the best laptop I've ever owned. Great features and configuration. Very very happy with the product.
Only have had it for 2 days but so far I really enjoy it. Itâs fast and certainly what I need for school.
Lite computer packed with all the latest technology.Great value for the price
This looks very promising. Look, feel and performance top notch for a teacher to use.
really fast and lightweight, considering the size of the screen
Speakers a little soft. Quick turn on time.
Just finger print is not perfect like iPhone
I like everything about it, specially with the SSD added.
Excellent laptop. Fast, lightweight.
Light WrightGood performance
wife is happy
I would not recommend you buying this laptop, the specs are fine for the price, but the hardware is rubbish. Even my 10 year old Toshiba outruns this computer. My screen broke when just putting a textbook on it. Don't even bother calling customer support, in my experience, they do you no good. Instead of buying this computer, just by a Acer Aspire E 15, which is not only durable, but also as a graphics card.
Fantastic computer. Very fast. Spend a little more money and get something that is much faster and reliable. This one has the SSD already installed so you do not have to spend the $270 to add the SSD the other reviewers talk about on this same computer (w/o the SSD card). The first notebook replacement I purchased was the Lenovo Ideapad 320, wow what a disappointment. Slower than my 8 year old notebook. Returned and got this one and could not be happier! You get what you pay for!
Mousepad doesn't work. Piece of s. after reading all the bad reviews, just sent it back for a refund.
Brief issue in that I initially got one without the SSD, but this was promptly corrected, and now, as everybody says, this is really one quick machine for this price. It boots from cold nearly as fast as my iPad, seems to handle most of what I throw at it. If you don't need a touchscreen/stylus, it's hard to imagine a much better machine for the money.
If u want to edit videos on this then 1080p videos with the added ssd is smooth most of the time. Ultra HD 4k gets annoying but if it's under 4 minutes then it's manageable. Can't edit 4k video with out horrible playback
We brought this last week. Apart from the initial setup, we have not used the laptop. The laptop charger has sparked repeatedly. I will be returning this item.
My previous ASUS laptop I bought in 2009 (UL50V) is still working perfectly (with the replacement of an SSD and a new battery, something like a knee surgery for human beings...), not fast enough to work on a newer version of Microsoft Office. So I bought this new ASUS VivoBook for me and my employee.So far so good. The fingerprint reader might be too sensitive (~miss reading my finger about 40% of the time). In addition, the acoustic does not perform better than UL50V. But I did not expect too much from those two aspects at the beginning. Other than those, me and my employee are pretty satisfied with this laptop. Can't be wrong with a solid-built laptop if your budget is about $600.
This computer arrived fine but will not charge. How can a brand new computer not charge properly? I am still waiting for how Amazon and ASUS will resolve this.
Excellent laptop, ignore the bad reviews. Not a lot of bloatware and the TN screen is not a big deal and you get a faster refresh rate than IPS also easy on the eyes. The video card does great on high end games at top settings with no freezing, the TI version is not exactly better, just better in some areas. I'm very impressed with it and if it is not enough room on the SSD then do what I did and buy another 256 GB (SATA) on crucial along with an 8 GB DDR4 2400Mhz stick of ram and it's a Ferrari. Get a good free antivirus like avira, get rid of some of the bloatware but be careful not to delete anything with drivers, and if you plan to video capture leave the Xbox app. I really can't believe the bad reviews, even with the addons your under a grand with a very high end machine. The charger is long and has a nice power light along with the slick look of the keyboard and red backlights which actually looks great so if your contemplating this vs an asus or the hp omen like I was I'd def go for this one again. Oh and the fans are pretty quiet and effective along with easy to clean since you have one screw on the bottom of this and run a plastic pry tool around the edge and your into all the hardware. Also it boots in about 5 secs and I have a lot of programs booting on startup just to see how it would handle it. Great buy at this price since a lot of other choices have a hybrid drive or optical with under 200GB SSD or none at all, also the Ram speed is 2400 and capable of 2666 MHz according to crucial with 32 GB MAX (2 slot ) Hope this helps someone!
Awful. I've had this computer for about 10 months now and the case to my never-leaves-my-desk, completely-babied laptop broke. Googled it, and it looks like it's a common issue--a screw that holds the case together near the power input and the LCD screen breaks and the case pulls apart. If you're thinking, "Oh, if it's a common problem then Dell will repair the issue free-of-charge", then you'd be wrong. They want to charge me $239 to fix my otherwise pristine laptop WHILE IT IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. Yes, you read that right. This laptop is still under warranty (whatever that means for a Dell product), and they still want me to pay to fix a documented flaw in their design on the less-than-a-year-old computer.So no, I would not recommend. And this is from someone who has been a loyal Dell purchaser since her first computer. I've already canceled my Dell credit card over this with how bad their service department has handled this. I'm not usually one to complain (especially without trying to resolve the issue--I don't have time for that kind of negativity in my life), but I felt I needed to speak out on this one. Learn from my pain, people.
Sleek looking laptop that runs like a dream. Battery life is good and perfectly runs gta. Very Happy with my purchase.
Initially with the standard 8gb of ram, it wasn't powerful enough to game and stream at the same time. That was to be expected. However, I bought another stick of ram for cheaper on eBay of the same type to upgrade to 16gb and it has been able to stream using OBS and various capture cards quite well, on the go especially.or gaming, regardless it has a GTX1050, I feel my GTX960 4gb on my desktop is much more powerful, but it could be that the CPU is throttling the GPU in some cases, however it's possible to play a lot of today's games on medium settings at 60fps which is perfectly fine for me. I really got this laptop for media production, and with the poor panel (TN panel,) it's quite hard to justify color, but you can change the panel for a very cheap price and easy installation.I will say this much though, you can't really get these decent specs for this price range right now, and since they're simply overpricing on a lot of computer parts and packages, I'd say it's the best deal right about now for a mid-high range laptop. Upgrade your ram and possibly an i7, and you've got yourself a portable, powerful workstation for a great price.
Shipped fast, handled demanding games, and came with the listed specs: i5 7300HQ, GTX 1050 3GB, and 8GB Ram. I was very satisfied with how fast it shipped and how strong it is. I'd get more ram in the future but for now, these 8GB will be perfectly fine. I also love the build quality and the soft touch finish and this is also VERY easy to upgrade. 10/10 would buy again. This is worth the $800 for a cheap, strong gaming laptop.
So I bought this laptop and I really like the speed of the SSD. The only problem I found was that the ram chip that came with it is garbage. I bought 2 8 gig crucial Ram chips that they recommend with it and it's really screaming now and have not had a problem with it freezing while playing Doom like I did with the original 8gig ram chip that came with it. I couldn't play more than 30 minutes before it froze now I don't have to worry about it. The packaging was excellent and it came right on time. All the games I've played I have played with graphics on Max and the computer doesn't miss a beat.
The monitor is not as good compared to it's predacessor which I bought when it came out. Otherwise good laptop would of easily paid the extra 50$ for the same quality monitor as the model prior versus saving 50$ for this downgrade. Images are more grainy and blurry in comparison. Even with the better specs I feel disappointed by the monitor so much so that the older laptop feels superior with my 960m and 6th gen i5.
I've always been a huge Dell fan, and this product proves that Dell still makes great quality products!Love the unique look and feel, and the frame quality feels very sturdy - plus the lap-top is actually slimmer than expected.For non graphic intensive use the fan is off. This along with the solid-state hard drive makes it 100% silent which is really awesome!While the charger is legitimately bulky (as many other reviews say), its not nearly enough of a set-back to prevent me from giving it 5 stars!
The laptop was a great overall but been having issues with it the past week. I factory reset the laptop and update the bios, graphics card, and windows. Then it just shut down after starting a game on it. Tried force reset a few times didn't work. Replaced the dcin wire since it was burned out, still didn't work. Just had the computer one year it's dcin cable got burned out and the motherboard is short circuit.
Works great! I received a similar model initially that was non-functional, but Amazon refunded it and I ordered this one instead.5/5 Laptop (so far!)5/5 Amazon Support <3
Love this laptop. A lot of power for the price!
Highly recommended!
Boots up fast and plays all of my games without lagging or overheating. My wife uses it for her College work as well and has had no issues.
For a sub-$1,000 gaming laptop, this is about as good as it gets. The specs seemed too good to be true, but they are. Just about all aspects of it are great, from the display to the backlit keyboard, et cetera. There are handy raised icons on the Escape, S, F, J, Delete, and Down Arrow keys that are unique to each other and make it easy to quickly find where you are on the keyboard. The function keys are dual purpose, and have mute, volume up/down, brightness up/down, et cetera. The backlighting on the keyboard can be adjusted to a lower brightness and even turned completely off. As far as performance goes, it hasn't had a single problem so far on any of the games I've been playing, even on high settings. I also found that it performs faster when plugged in rather than on battery. Keep this in mind as it will increase FPS and all general processing speeds. Access to the internal components is very simple, achievable by undoing a single screw to remove a panel covering most of the bottom of the laptop. I've installed a 2 TB HDD and 8 more GB of RAM, and had no problems doing either. Disclaimer: it ONLY accepts DDR4 RAM, so keep that in mind if you want to upgrade it. The battery is user-replaceable, and while I've seen people say it lasts any certain amount of hours, for me, it usually lasts about 3 hours if I'm gaming and around 5 for normal tasks. Since I'm generally at home and keep it plugged in anyway, it's a moot aspect. The subwoofer being on the bottom has made absolutely no difference to me, since I always listen to audio through headphones, so any drawback there really depends on if you're going to listen without headphones, and even then I've found it to be just fine. The display's color is great, and the highest brightness is very bright, while the lowest is very low, giving you a wide range of brightness, which is useful if you're around others and don't want to disturb them. All in all, for the price, this is an absolute s t e a l. I'd probably buy this over any other laptop $1,400 and down. (It also helps that I'm a sucker for the slick black and red color scheme.) The only thing I'd like is for there to be a version with a larger display, but that's really nothing to do with this model. I highly recommend this to anyone.
good value. A bit ugly and heavy, but it doesn't bother me.
Still a year later this laptop continues to perform incredibly well.
Very nice laptop. I have been running it for a couple months without any issues
Bought it for my son who started UIUC. It has everything he needed for engineering major
The Toshiba-manufactured SSD drive that came with this laptop died after less than 4 months of ownership. On top of this, it looks like you will not be able to run any operating system other than Windows 10 on this laptop for the foreseeable future. After the SSD drive died, I tried installing my licensed Windows 8 on a spare SSD drive. Even with the updates, many hardware components either malfunctioned (graphics card) or did not work at all (wireless adapter). There were a bunch of "unknown" hardware components listed in the device manager. I also tried installing Ubuntu Linux 14.04 and 16.04. The 14.04 version complained about some "unknown chipset" and failed to install. The 16.04 version just froze during installation from a DVD without giving any errors. My recommendation is to stay away from this laptop.
Loving it so far
All is good. New and fresh laptop straight from factory
Great budget gaming laptop.
Huge bang for you bucks.
The display in this laptop is a low-quality-TN type panel with poor contrast and viewing angles, which is considerably worse than the typical TN desktop monitors often covered in comparison videos, and I would say frankly doesn't make sense for a laptop costing this much. Companies are too-often keen on offering upgrades over already-good CPU/RAM specs, while dropping the ball on very noticeable components the buyers don't always know to check or know what standards to have for, such as the display. This is one of such laptops.This is the 5577 model, and the same used to be the case for the 7567 model, but Dell realized their mistake and partially addressed the problem by switching to an IPS panel on most sub-models in the USA and a few other regions. It is not a high-end IPS panel with 72% NTSC color gamut, but is a 45% NTSC IPS panel which I would say is to expect at the bracket this laptop is in.The 7567 also offers a NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti which is a bigger improvement over the GTX 1050 than the "i7" 7700HQ is over the "i5" 7300HQ, for most gaming. Intel's branding scheme I think is a bit misleading since basically any HQ-series outperforms any U-series regardless of the Core i-number, despite the i-number being the focus of most promotional materials, but that's an issue for another post. The main point I want to make here is that the Inspiron 7567 is a more recommendable option to me because of its better GPU and much less poor quality display.To get this, you need to choose the 7567 model and not the 5577 model you see in this listing, and you need to choose one that lists "IPS" for the display spec, since not all of them do. I recommend model FNCWF514S which has the IPS display, GTX 1050 Ti, and 256GB SSD. The RAM is upgradable, and the 2.5" HDD bay is left open for storage expandability.You can choose to replace the display yourself, and if so I would probably recommend an AUO B156HAN01.2 or LG LP156WF6-SPB1 for 72% NTSC color gamut. That is the only case I think I could truly recommend the Inspiron 5577, and it's still a tradeoff because you won't get the better GPU that the 7567 offers. Here is a genuine and confirmed-compatible 72% NTSC replacement display:Â AU OPTRONICS B156HAN01.2 LAPTOP LCD SCREEN 15.6" Full-HD DIODE (SUBSTITUTE REPLACEMENT LCD SCREEN ONLY. NOT A LAPTOP )
Not a bad laptop, had good specs and quality for the price.But mine would not charge as soon as I got it, and a quick google search revealed this has been a serious issue with all Dell laptops for years. There customer support was awful, the emails I got back were in broken English at best. They offered to "fix" my laptop but they had to have it for 14 business days which wasn't going to happen since I needed a laptop. They then proceeded to simply stop emailing me back which is when I decided to just return it and pick a different company.It's really a shame since the laptop itself is fine. But this is the second Dell I've owned (both of which have had this problem), and both times I've had equally awful customer support.
Worked great for about six weeks. Started freezing up and was unable to use it. Took it to be looked at by a tech and was told it had a bad CPU and was running 58 degrees Celsius with no apps running. Was advised to return it. Have sent it into Amazon's recommended repair company. I have the 6th gen version of this laptop and never have had a problem. When this laptop has been repaired i will update this review.
Love it
I'm a software engineer. I take excellent care of my computers; shut them down when not in use; keep them very clean. No food or drink near them. I have laptops from 10+ years ago that still work (yes, I actually still use them). This Dell is terrible.- Purchased June 2017.- Broke December 2017. Would not power on. Sent in to Dell for repairs; they said it had a defective motherboard board. Fixed it under warranty.- Broke again April 2018. Same problem as before.Now I'm forced to buy an extended warranty because I have a laptop that breaks every 5 months. I guess that's one way to many money... Thanks, Dell.The good:Very fast (when it actually turns on). Nice graphics.The bad:The keyboard is garbage. I thought it would just need to be broken in. However, even after 10 months, some keys are still very stiff. If you don't push the keys just right, it won't register. Not good for fast pace gaming. For example, trying to push W to move forward and nothing happens...
In 2007 I bought a new Dell Inspiron laptop, and in the ten years that followed I used the heck out of it. I edited thousands of documents, wrote software on it, even edited audio and video files, all running on a Socket 775 Core2 Duo processor. That laptop is still running today, although it can't compete with the processors and underlying architecture of new systems; they're just so much faster and more capable overall.Fast forward to two weeks ago. I purchased this new "gaming" laptop, expecting a system that would meet my needs for today and years into the future. So far my experience with this "state of the art" laptop has been anything but great. Sure, it's nice to look at with the dull, almost rubbery outer coating, the sleek red lines and illuminated, full-size keyboard. The laptop is, on paper, a very capable system, and I so wish it would have been what I hoped, but alas it falls fall very short.My two biggest complaints about this system by far are the display, and the unit's tendency to hang/hesitate.The LCD display on this is atrocious. You have such a narrow vertical viewing angle that you simply can't view the whole screen at its optimal contrast at the same time. When you tilt the display to put the "sweet spot" across the middle, the upper and lower sections of the display show that telltale reflection common on older, and lower end LCD panels, that makes images look washed out, almost shiny or inverted. And even the portion of the screen that's optima has the dullest, most uninspiring color and contrast I've seen since LCD's first hit the market in the early 2000s. Imagine one of those old projection televisions in a bar, with 4-5 years of smoke and dust film on the lenses, and you have an idea how washed out and unimpressive is this display. The problem is the choice of technology: Dell chose an LCD panel that uses Twisted Numatic (TN) technology to render the pixels. It can't hold a candle to the newer Inter-Plane Switching (IPS) displays, which Apple uses almost exclusively due to their superior color and contrast, or the latest Organic LED (OLED) panels, which represent the very best in color and contrast. No, this panel is something you'd expect to see on a $49 no-name tablet, or an early ATM machine. I can't stop shaking my head over this, because IPS panels aren't but a few dollars more than TN panels, and it would have a HUGE difference in the overall look and usability of this product.As bad as the LCD is, the other issue is much worse, by far. That is the laptop's tendency to hang or hesitate. I noticed this right out of the box, and even after wiping the drive and installing a pristine (i.e. bloatware-free) Windows 10 image, the system seems to hesitate, every few minutes, for anywhere from 5-15 seconds. The cursor pops up the "busy" spinning circle, and nothing responds to mouse clicks until seconds later. I've updated the drivers to the very latest version, shut down unneeded services, even flashed the UEFI BIOS to the latest version, but this hesitation continues, and it's bad enough that it's become a dealbreaker for me. I've read stories from other people who've had the same issue with this, so my gut tells me it's probably a behavior I'll have to learn to live with, and I'm just not willing to spend $800+ on something that can't do any better than that.Sorry, Amazon, but I gotta send this stinker back.
This laptop uses TN panel, if you want better display quality you need to change the screen for an IPS panel display.
When it comes to technology I'm not someone who has to have the most expensive, top of the line, best of the best of every component to be happy. I understand that compromises have to be made to bring a price down to a more palatable point. What makes me happy is a reliable machine that efficiently runs what I need/want it to without major issues or headaches at a decent price. I am very happy with this laptop.
It was What I expected it to be, a powerful and fast machine for the price.
For the price of 800 dollars this laptop is pretty good and easily up-gradable fyi the only things that can be upgradable is the ram, ssd, and if you want to you can install a hardrive.
Well, if you plan on watching youtube or the internet in general, then also plan on it freezing for about 15 seconds. Then it will start beeping, blackscreen and go to sleep randomly. This has to be a manufacturing error because it's pretty ridiculous how often it happens. No other computer that I've owned has done this. Now I'm in college and need a computer to write on. $800 typewriter... (1/10Before the glitches started happening, the thing was about a 3/5 for gaming. It gets very hot BUT is very quiet. The graphics aren't anything special. (i5 with 4 gb dedicated graphics) (4/10The keyboard is kind of annoying in the fact that it dims at the right time to not see anything. Once lit up they look nice. (7/10The speakers are trash. "subwoofer" is related directly to bass. The bass is nonexistent, so that's a complete lie. It's about as loud as your phone plus a little. (3/10If you have bigger hands I feel this keyboard ( for typing) is suited more for you. some laptops in the market have tiny keyboards where you press "caps" for an "a" which doesn't happen with this one. (+5Just because the glitch freezes started happening I have to give it 1/5 stars. The machine must be functioning properly for me to give it anything above that.Total 20/40 = 5/10 before faulty glitchEdit...The "e" key just fell out. 1 month and a couple days after I bought it. Can't send it back. No warranty. This is so pathetic. Don't buy this POS
We triggered a bomb alert in a TSA/CBP Check, due to the batteries in this laptop, it has a clock battery as well which also triggered the alert, we were detained for about an hour and the check line in the airport was closed because of the x-ray of the laptop. Until the explosive specialist came and checked it.
This has been a fine laptop, for 6 months. At this point, the hinge for the screen disconnected from the base of the laptop as shown in the images. The hinge then pushed the keyboard up and away, breaking plastic clips in the process. I am understanding of occasional hardware failures, but Dell is claiming that the failure is not covered under warranty, as it is "Accidental Damage". This is a $239 repair for an almost new laptop.
the battery was defective
The HDMI port is not 2.0, so maximum resolution output to a TV or monitor is 3840 x 2160 @ 30hz. This is insufficient to stream UHD 4k content from Netflix, rendering this laptop mostly useless to me. GPU can drive that content, but only via more advanced HDMI port or Display port. Very disappointing. It should be made clearer in the product description that this laptop will NOT be able to stream 4k content.
the worst piece of garbage I've ever bought......I would name this the ''Dell slow cooker''every single day that I have to work on this computer is a living nightmarei called up to complain but there was no1 to talk to... i have never ever written such a review but sorry.... cant help it
You'd think that a 1060 would be half decent but not even a year after ordering I'm getting plagued with some bsod. Nothings more frustrating than loosing hours worth of work over a some so trivial as decent drivers for a overpriced laptop. I'd giggle if anyone bought this laptop today expecting a good experience from it.
After a few months the charging cable wasn't being recognized properly by the laptop. It is no longer charging the laptop, so the only way to use it is to keep it plugged in. If I wanted a desktop, I would have bought a desktop.
Laptop works absolutely great. Fans turn on only when needed, battery lasts quite a bit.I have experienced a bit of hanging, but it is definitely due to Windows and NOT the hardware itself. Will test dual boot with Linux to confirm.
Comes with a garbage TN screen. Switched out for an IPS recommended by another reviewer and now this computer is truly amazing. Added another 8GB ram as well.
This is a really classy-looking computer with a lot of cool features. On the other hand, it does have some disappointing short-comings, as well.When you first start up the machine, you'll see a bunch of legal gobbledygook on the screen. This user agreement, etc., is very tedious reading on-screen, rather than on paper. It's basically saying Dell, Microsoft and their affiliates can do pretty much whatever they want, while the user is quite limited in his/her rights. There are some optional settings that Dell, Microsoft and others would like you to select that allow them to spy on you. Select "NO" for all the check-boxes during the set-up stage, to avoid prying eyes without limiting the performance of your machine.Even though this computer comes with Windows 10, it does not have a touch screen. It has an impressive back-lit keyboard, including a 10-key pad and shortcut/soft keys. You can adjust the back-lighting of the keyboard and the screen to adapt to personal preference during daylight use or in a darkened room. The mouse pad works fine, but I prefer to use a wireless mouse for more control. This one was particularly sensitive to touch, which I found annoying. However, serious gamers may actually prefer this sensitivity. Either way, you can adjust the settings to suit your needs.Although the screen on this computer is a few inches wider than my old laptop, the thickness of the computer is less. This means it fits more easily into a protective sleeve or case. The unit was surprisingly heavy--most likely due to the battery and other hardware. The power supply is about the size of a 3 x 5 inch card and considerably thinner than others I have seen. The cable seems thick, flexible and durable. It has a blue ring that lights up near the port when the unit is plugged in and charging. The battery seems to hold its charge for a long time, depending on what you do with the computer. Obviously, video or gaming will drain it faster than other applications.You can tell there is a really great graphics card in this machine, as the images are as crisp and clear as a high-def TV screen. The speaker system is good, too. This makes video streaming and gaming pure pleasure. The processor is quite powerful, as well. However, don't try to do anything when your computer is downloading large updates, as it can affect the performance of your machine. I did notice, when typing in word-processing and email apps, that the flow of characters on the screen could be a bit choppy. This is not a big deal, but may be distracting to some users.The software provided was pretty limited. There is a free trial of Microsoft Office 365, but it only lasts for five days. They want you to purchase or pay for licensing for their programs. However, you can find excellent free alternatives online, such as WPS Office Suite by Kingsoft or Softmaker Office. There are the usual proprietary games, browsers and other programs, including a free one-year subscription to McAfee security software.There are lots of different kinds of data ports on this computer. There are two USB 3.0 ports and one with power share. There's a headset port, an HDMI port, a media card-reader, and a network port. You can keep your computer from being stolen by using the security cable slot. I wish there was a side-by-side set of ports for both a microphone and audio, as this will only work with a headset that has a single jack; my headset has two separate jacks.Glaringly absent from this unit is a CD-Rom slot. I know CDs and DVDs are going the way of the dinosaur. However, I still have some favorite programs, movies, games and music on compact and video discs that I can't use on this device. I was able to transfer some using a cable and flash drive or network sharing. Nevertheless, I think this was a serious oversight in the design of a gaming computer. Depending on what kind of system you have, I am not sure there are enough of the right kind of ports to connect this computer to ancillary devices. You may need Bluetooth, wireless or physical adapters to hook up to other gaming equipment--such as control paddles, headsets, or your big-screen TV.If you like to "see" your opponent when gaming, or enjoy Skyping friends and family, there is a camera built into this computer. I am inclined, however, to keep the lens covered with a sticky note when not in use. Call me paranoid, but the idea of someone being able to access and turn this on remotely to spy on me really creeps me out! There is a dual microphone with the camera, which I assume allows for communication in stereo.Some users complained of exceptionally loud fans on this computer. Either I don't use enough resources to require them to run so heavily, or mine were in better shape than those people, because I did not notice anything out-of-the-ordinary.I appreciate how easily this computer starts up and shuts down. Most of the other machines I am used to take their own sweet time--which means you have to allow yourself a few minutes before sitting down to work/play when you start up the machine or before you walk away when you are done.
Pros:- Excellent expandability for memory and storage.- GTX 1050 w/ 4Mb.Cons:- no USB-CAnd now to the near fatal flaw. The TN screen is nothing short of terrible. Fortunately, replacing it is a straightforward procedure. I ended up replacing mine with this: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JMM89NC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I am not a serious gamer or a techie, but just a guy who uses computers for a variety of reasons, just like everyone else. So you should know that this review is based on the Dell machine itself, and not on Windows 10. I chose a Windows 10 machine because its the operating system that I am most familiar with.Also, this review was written with an understanding that this is a"value-added" gaming machine, and not a high end or middle range machine. That said, somethings were evidently done with lesser expensive materials so other things could be added and bring the machine into its market niche.Out of the box, set up was easy. The box contains the computer, the charging cord and a piece of paper. Pretty basic. Turning the machine on that first time was easy and set up was nothing out of the ordinary. The cord has a huge transformer on it and there is no short cord option. The machine does not generate an excessive amount of heat during prolonged periods of play or other programs that require a lot of processing power.The operating system sits on a partition on the 128SSD drive, while the "D" drive is named "Data" is a 1TB HDD. One of the things that you will notice is that everything that comes preloaded (operating system, Anti-Virus, a couple games, and a trial version of Office) resides on the C drive. This uses up 51-52% of that drive's space. I offloaded some stuff I will never use (Disney, Skype, etc.) and it really didn't make a dent in what was resident on the SDD. What did make a huge difference is that my personal choice for Antivirus protection is ESET, not McAfee. So offloading McAfee and installing ESET brought the total SSD usage down to 47%. I set the machine up so that anything and everything can use the HDD aside from the operating system. Crazy? Maybe. I would haven't taken this step had it come with a 256 SDD.On the plus side of the equation, the display is pretty sweet. Colors are good, the graphics card delivers exactly what the description implies. The screen does have a "wide" bezel. Again, this is probably one of the trade-offs that Dell needed to make to bring the machine to market.The machine is heavy given how slim it is. Yet the weight is not in the case, which is one of two issues I had with the unit itself. While I am sure it was a trade-off, the plastic body feels cheap. Tap on the frame and you get a soft hollow sound. I would have rather Dell spent a dollar or two per machine and developed a better case.My second, and more critical observation is that the keyboard is not great. It's not even good. It is the lowest standard of adequate. The keys give no feedback when you press them and they are so low to the case that it's easy to lose track of where your fingers are. Sometimes they are on a key, sometimes they are partially on a key. The other thing is that the keys are backlite by blue light, compounding the frustration of the extreme low profile keys. Unless you are in a totally dark room, the blue light wave length makes seeing the keys difficult, especially if you have a vision issue. This, the keyboard, is the weakest part of the computer; I would urge Dell to provide a keyboard with better sensory feedback.Other features are a USB 2.0 on the right side and two 3.0 USB's on the left. An odd little partial flap covers the Ethernet port. They could have saved a few cents there and done away with the flap. We had no problem hooking the machine up to a 32" monitor for a reunion and using the laptop to run a picture show last Sunday. Lots of "Ooooh's" and "Ahhhh's".One other feature that I do like is that you can combine this lap with another monitor for dual screens. I know that this is becoming a more common feature, but it works effortlessly.So the bottom-line is that this machine gets four out of five stars. It would have gotten five stars if it weren't for the keyboard. It delivers what it promises, but I think that for a few more dollars you can land a Dell with a better case and keyboard. Still, if you are on a strict budget, this is the way to go.So again, my four out of five-star review is that machine delivers what it promises, but its keyboard is a definite minus.NOTE: I reserve the right to change this review over the next year or so relative to issues of durability or the parts should that problem arise. The addition will appear as an update at the top of the review.
It doesn't look like much closed, and it has a very lightweight, plastic feel which makes me question how durable it might be if carried around and moved a lot. The lightweight construction does make it comfortable and easy to carry. It is a nice, big, full-size laptop that seems like a great model to send off to college with a responsible student. There is nothing obviously "gamer" looking about the unit until it is opened, and then the blue light of the neon blue keyboard looks ultra cool.The keyboard is shallow but easy to get used to, and the mousepad is not so large that it is hard to do simple things with. (I have found some gaming keyboards have touchpads so large that it is hard to copy and paste quickly, for example.)The display looks nice when watching movies in high def, and the performance when streaming high definition movies is awesome. It has plenty of power for doing graphics and video editing. Gameplay for me is smooth and even, though I typically only play roleplaying and puzzle games at full screen. The audio is a decent volume to hear if watching movies or videos, but headphones or bt speaker are needed for any decent volume to share or for an immersive experience.It does come ready for wireless network connection, but it has a wired port for LAN parties, or possibly for travel needs.It does have hdmi2, and it has a C port, so I am thinking that I might collect a video capture card to it and use it for streaming on Twitch. I love that it is quick to charge, and that fully charged, it is lasting me over 6 hours.
Ugh. Why do manufactures stick things like McAfee on their computers? I'm not a fan of it and I selected to not activate it when setting up the computer. It activated any how and disabled the anti-virus that I installed. It also attached to the browers. I was able to uninstall it but it was still an aggravation. It does appear to be totally gone now. Besides that, the computer is pretty clean without a ton of bloatware that comes on some computer.The keyboard and touchpad are both very responsive. The keys on the keyboard do take some getting used to since they aren't as pronounced as most other keyboards.Online and switching between task, the computer responds quickly and smoothly. So far, I have had no issues with it running hot or with it lagging. Setting it up was easy (besides the whole antivirus deal). There is only one small paper with the laptop but it does talk you through the process once you power it up.The laptop is heavier than I expected since it's so slim but it's not too bad. I do feel it needs a well protected case if you carry it somewhere since it is very thin.
I wanted a laptop for 2 purposes: 1) so I could browse the web quickly and stream videos and 2) so my husband could play games, even if at a lower quality, while we live abroad.It seems like my browser is constantly freezing (at least once per browsing session, but more times the longer I'm on, even if I'm just writing emails), and it is not an internet problem. I usually have to wait a full 2 minutes for the computer to function again. We have an older laptop (with worse graphics) that never freezes.For gaming, my husband turned the graphics all the way down on Overwatch. He says there's still a bit of a lag, making the game unplayable in competitive mode since the response time will mess up your ability to do well.
This would be a decent laptop if it had a better IPS panel. Mine had lots of light bleed and a dead pixel. Once I noticed the pixel, my eye kept going to it. Hard for me to ignore. On top of that, the color accuracy is not especially good, and even at max brightness the screen struck me as a bit dim.While the storage is nice and snappy, if you are a gamer you'll need to put in a 2.5" hard drive if you expect to store much.Also, bear in mind this has an i5 quad core. You'll get significantly better performance with an i7. You'll run games nicely enough, but spend a little more and you'll be very satisfied. Also, the backlit keyboard is fairly dim and uneven, and the actual keys are not lit, just the space in between keys. I will say the sound is excellent.This is a fair laptop with a poor quality ISP panel.
Great graphics! This computer runs fast and is terrific for playing games. The screen is a good size but consequently this laptop is a bit heavy. It tends to heat up, so I recommend that a fan be purchased to accompany it. The sound quality is excellent. Sound effects are very clear and less "tinny" than on our non-gaming laptops. The blue lights on the keyboard are fun too. My family has not had a Dell before, and we are pleased with the performance of this model.
Pretty good deal
This is a very solid basic laptop which is good for playing e-sport games. Out of the box the machine has a pretty standard build of Windows 10 Home and the setup was flawless. It has some bloatware installed (think Candy Crush) and for better or worse it has Microsoft Office and McAfee Antivirus installed (but you need to buy license keys).The construction does not feel flimsy but the plastic build does not give a sense of durability. It feels like it will shatter if dropped. The machine is not light and the power brick is substantial. That said, it is not bad compared to a Windows gaming rig but it is a boat anchor compared to any modern Mac laptop. The keyboard is pleasantly responsive and nicely backlit but the extra lighting around WASD is annoying if you are watching a movie in a dark room. The display is surprisingly bright and vivid for watching 4K video. The trackpad, which is offset a bit to the left, is nice for one handed use. It is responsive and large enough to allow scrolling across the entire display in a single swipe.I tested the video card using Player Unknown's Battleground. It defaulted to medium to high settings and played smoothly at 60 frames per second. The card was able to comfortably drive an external monitor running a reasonably high resolution (1920x1080).My only gripe is the default power management. The throttling when the machine is unplugged is clearly noticeable. Download speeds drop by about 20 percent and the machine is noticeably slower for even common tasks like opening multiple instances of File Explorer. It can be fixed using the windows power management settings but in the hands of a novice (who does not know how to tweak windows) this machine will feel slow.I do not trust the feel of the construction on this in the hands of a 12 year old (or a clumsy 52 year old) but if you are looking for a budget gaming laptop and you don't mind carrying around the weight this is a good buy.
I absolutely love this laptop. I went with the 16GB RAM, 512SSD, i7 version. So, in my opinion the top of the line. I'm an engineering student and I had an okay Dell laptop for a couple of years after my initial Lenovo laptop completely failed on me. The laptop I had was a midrange i5 inspiron that just wasn't fast enough and the start time on it was horrible.I've had this laptop for the last few months and I can run any software I want on it and it's lightning fast. I can run Matlab, compile and run C code, or even do a simulation in Ansys or Solidworks (mainly thanks to the 16GB RAM). If you're borderline between this laptop and maybe like an Acer or Lenovo with similarly impressive hardware stats that's maybe a little cheaper I would absolutely recommend paying a bit more for this laptop. The quality is superb, the specs can't be beat, and the price is extremely reasonable.I haven't tried out any gaming on it yet to check on the graphics card, but with a 4GB Nvidia graphics card, the performance is probably fantastic.The display is great, backlit keyboard is awesome, and for being considered a "gaming" laptop it doesn't look to gawdy.I don't care if you're a gamer or not - I'm not - this laptop (with the specs I have) really can't be beat.Okay, now that you found this laptop after searching and wading through reviews and specs for possibly days you can finally stop searching. It's the real deal.
Minus the bloatware that has to be manually removed by the user, this laptop does everything. It runs a lot of the games I love playing (League, TERA, Overwatch) at surprisingly good frames for the price (Almost always 50-60FPS)I have the i5 version as well, so for games that could really utilize the multi-threading capabilities of the i7, I can imagine it could be even better.Would definitely recommend to anyone looking into an affordable gaming laptop that doubles as a work station
DO NOT BUY THIS G5 5587. I am highly disappointed. Its new hardware comes with buggy drivers and firmware. Soon after I bought it, the wifi network started giving me trouble. There were other issues. Any software I would run, the processor fan would start being loud. I spent the first whole week with the customer service people, their technicians updating all drivers and reinstalling windows 10. Still couldn't fix the problem. I am stuck with this piece of junk. On top of that, the back light for the keyboard does not stay lit. It is hard to see the keyboard letters in the dark. The tech people said there is no driver for that yet. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK. THEY ARE STILL TESTING IT. I wish I could give it back!!!!
Do not buy a dell. The computer works fine until it doesn't and Dell will not cover anything! You will talk to someone in India for 45 minutes and get told to contact another department that handles out of warranty issues. Nothing is their fault.If I could give dell a review it would be -5 stars
Just stay away from Dell. It will break. Again and again. But the worst part is the support you will have to deal with. Hours and hours of borderline legal, unethical and outright humiliating activities. If you can understand the accent of course. For just $800 you just paid. Should I mention you will never get them back?Go with HP. It may cost $50 extra, but it will be the best investment of 50 bucks.
Good seller 5 starsThank you !
I bought this to play World of Warcraft on it. That's it, nothing else but Blizzard games.The keyboard is a major issue. Works when just typing, you want to use it to play a game no dice, and I mean AT ALL.This effects ALL keyboards that are attached to the computer. Bluetooth, USB and the built in one.You want to walk somewhere, too bad. It wont recognize that you pressed the key, unless you press it 10 times. Open you bags, NOPE.Want to hit the esc button to log out, too bad.Want to press 2 movement keys at the same time HAHAHAHHAHA...no, not even once did I get that to work.This as you can tell makes the "gaming" laptop pretty much useless for gaming.Run away from this as fast as you can, unless you just want an over priced laptop.Also for those wondering what kind of FPS they are looking at for games. At May of 2017 it will do about 50 FPS on lvl 5 (of 10) for World of Warcraft. Lets just say my desktop that is 7 years old and has a 3 year old basic graphics card does better FPS.Edit: After calling Dells tech support and getting nothing but transferred around to people that were pushing a "premium service" I found that if you adjust one of the graphic card settings everything works well. Still only 3 stars due to horrible customer service and the fact that this laptop with a 15 inch screen is the same size as my 17inch screen old laptop.
big disappointment-randomly restarted every day multiple times a day-without warning, closing me out of everything I was working on. I tried changing power and updates settings with no change in behavior. Further internet research revealed this random restarting is a known issue which requires technical intervention and may be linked to a corrupt OS. Fan was very noisy. This laptop was defective in multiple ways from the moment of power on.
Price was right to replace family computer we use primarily for internet, correspondence, light video editing.Speakers are weak, barely loud enough for occasional family movie watching.Microsoft products are becoming a bigger headache, but that is not Lenovo's fault...
I've been a Mac person since 2007 up to about a month ago when I spilled coffee on my laptop. I wasn't going to dish out $1,800 on a new macbook. The transition has not been too difficult, though I'm still getting used to it.I would have given this computer 5 stars if it wasn't for one thing: the battery life is miserable. It will die after a little over an hour. That, and the fact that the charger is pretty short means I basically have to treat it like a desktop. Not ideal if you have to work while travelling.
I really like this computer. However for some reason even after the 3GB update it still has a few "freezing" issues. This computer boasts it's computing ability but i find it to be a bit slow for my tastes. Iv'e had wireless keyboard and mouse issues as well. Iv'e been troubleshooting and I am still not entirely sure why. The keyboard is working fine at this moment and I'm sure that it has nothing to do with the actual PC. Decent computer for the money. Helpful tech support through Amazon as well.
light, sturdy, and easy on the eyes
display stopped working within 2 days of use
Aside from the battery life being short, this is working fine for me. I bought it for school purposes and it's working out well.
For the money, when I purchased this it simply couldn't be beat. Works as it should.
Was running fine for a while and now itâs crashing every hour
No backlit keyboard makes this system really REALLY difficult to use at night.So far smooth start up and use which beats my old asus that just died but I'm really disappointed by the keyboard which should be baseline feature on ANY laptop by this point... Seriously.Really, I'd trade the start up speed for the ability to see what the heck I'm writing at night.
Rose Gold Color option specifically has a darker pink rose pattern on the area below the keyboard that fades out as it gets closer to the hinge. As far as the computer itself; once all the preloaded HP/Windows crapware gets uninstalled and you clean up your system some (meaning deleting McAfee, Skype, both incredible resource hogs) and installing all required updates, it runs decently. You'll need to do some additional tweaking to get it to run how you want it. At unboxing it was running at 100% disk usage and locking up constantly due to all the extra junk running in the background. Keys have a good feel to their press, touchscreen works well, battery test so far with out of the box battery set to HP Recommended power settings at about 70% screen brightness is (100% @ 7:45, 87% @ 8:17, 83% @ 8:30, 78% @ 8:45) so it likely has just over 4 hours of battery life. Trackpad and touchscreen are both responsive to light touch, so no need to slam the screen.
Opened up the delivery box and my wife loved the way it looked. Unfortunately that is the only positive I can say about this purchase. Upon setup, the volume was fading and in and out and sites kept crashing continually amongst several other issues. There is a chance we may just have gotten one that was a âlemonâ? but whomever they hire to professionally refurbish and verify proper function of their product should be re-evaluated on continuing to pay them for their services. Extremely disappointed. We had to re-box and start process to return the laptop within 30 minutes after delivery.
I bought this as a lightning deal because the price was great and my old laptop was starting to make strange noises whenever I started it up. I did not realize and was not aware when I purchased this laptop that the inside of the laptop has a rose print all over, which is not a deal breaker, but not something I care for. When I first started it up it ran like molasses, but after looking at the task manager I found it was because it was updating every piece of software that is on it. After several hour of updating and many restarts, it now runs great. I also can't figure out how to get the free year of Office365 that the listing said was included. I have emailed the seller, but am still waiting to hear back on that. I will update once I receive a response. For what I paid, I am happy with my new laptop.Update 1: I contacted the seller, Woot, and was told to contact HP for a product key for Office365. HP claims the laptop was not shipped to sellers with a year of Offce365. I contacted Woot again to see what they will do to make this right, as this is false advertising.Update 2: Woot contacted HP on my behalf and I received the product key for Office365 in the mail.
Beautiful laptop... EXCEPT IT SHUTS OFF WITH NO WARNING. I called HP too after getting no technical support from Amazon for the product and the 'warranty' it came with was already expired!!!!! I am in school and I cannot work with a laptop that shuts down whenever the hell it wants and I lose all of my work. I'm hoping this review will get me some help before I drop another 200$ at SquareTrade to get, something that's supposed to be new, fixed. :/ ANd No, it's not an overheating issue because I can hear and feel the fan working! Just a heads up to anyone else who gets this laptop or any kind of refurbished PC. This has been a slow-growing nightmare and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.
I got worried after reading the reviews but my machine runs great. No problems so far, the price was great and I am happy with my purchase. I too did not get any info on the Microsoft365 suite but I stopped using it long ago. Open Office is free and works great.
This is not a bad machine at all, the only thing that kept it from getting five stars is that there were a couple of sloppy errors made when the machine was refurbished. Screws missing, parts replaced with different colors than the rest of the machine, cosmetic things like that. It's a refurb, so these kind of things are not unusual, but since this was allegedly a FACTORY refurb, they just shouldn't have happened.This must have been one of those machines the home shopping networks devote an hour to selling because it was offered in every color of the rainbow and has a lot of features it doesn't really need. Be that as it may, at its core it's a fine machine, plenty of storage, decent (although non-expandable) RAM, enough ports, and only a minimum amount of HP bloatware. The display is good, 17 inches of good color and no bad pixels. keyboard is comfortable to use, and touchpad is responsive without being overly sensitive.A really good machine for the price, and I don't mind buying factory rehabs for this kind of a device. I only wish the factory would have done a little better job with the cosmetics.
I saw a couple of the reviews and got really worried! First off this is my first Windows laoptop in six years . I have been an avid chromebook user. With my sons egging me on how much steal this was at the sale price and touchscreen feature I decided to give it a try. With a bit of help from them I was up and running in less than 15 min. They helped me download Google Chrome and login. All my bookmarks and fav sites swooped right over from my chromebook including all my settings and most of my passwords! Some I had to re-enter and confirm for security reason but that's not a big issue at all. It is an absolutely beautiful machine. Now the speed is about the same for me because i have a supercharged Acer Chromebook 13 so they have the same Ram. But the screen size and touchscreen has me gobbsmacked! Also I did not expect the beautiful rose pattern on the keyboard of the rose gold. Nice detail! I mostly use mine for basic stuff like watching movies, facebook E-mail so Ram is not a big deal for me. The speed is a little better but not much. If you are looking for something for work or gaming there are similar HP on here with a lot more RAM and better processors but be ready to pay more money but I think it would be worth it!
I looks good but the mouse pad was damaged, a hardware issue, i found out. I use an external mouse now. It routinely bluescreens but i think that's an hp issue and not necessarily one the laptop itself has, considering it worked like a dream until i updated it. Good bit of tech if you don't mind roadblocks. I am a very patient person
Quality product. Highly recommended. Product came tightly packaged and everything was in place. Setup was easy and on point. Follow instructions and you will be all good. Thanks amazon for selling quality products.
Just like new! Easy to set up. No problems at all!! Love it
This computer isnât the worst computer ever. But it isnât the best either. Initial startup was quick and easy. During the first couple of days it did many updates as usual for any new computer. But after that it was still very slow and the fan was really loud. Even if I was just browsing on google the fan would start up and be really loud. Speed was very unpredictable as well. Some days it worked great and other it was absolutely the slowest computer Iâve ever had. However, it is very beautiful and the touchscreen worked wonderfully. Overall, I wouldnât really recommend this computer. I would do your research before buying any electronic device.
I purchased this for my daughter, it was very slow to boot up and then when updates for windows would happen it would get even worse. Now the laptop doesnât work and I canât return it!
So this is my first laptop and my first HP product. Only had custom desktops previously. So I was pretty excited when I got it. Was running poorly at first, but I saw that it was doing a lot of updating. So I left it alone for a few hours, but was still not getting the performance I expected. So I installed a fresh version of Windows and got rid of all the bloatware that comes loaded onto it, and now it runs great! Definitely worth the $400 bucks I payed for it.
Itâs easy to use and love the touch screen
Piece of junk, don't buy! Cant update windows 1st week. 2nd week, keeps rebooting constantly. 2.5 weeks, won't even boot up anymore!!! No more HP, especially refurbished ones!!
It's a little slow (I wish it had a Pentium processor) but it's a gorgeous device and suits my needs. I love the huge 17 inch HD screen!
Does not come with office 365 as advertised. Shower that molasses is right. Been updating for 5 hours now.
Works great- the loaded moscrisoft software was temp stuff, though ad said it came with.
Not the best computer, not even close to the best. It's big. 17" screen w/ a dvd drive and it weighs over 7 pounds. It is NOT a laptop it's more of a portable desktop. You cannot read the keys from any angle because they are the same color as the case so they blend in so well that you have to be directly over the keys to read them. And did I say it is slow. It takes 2-4 minutes to boot, and that's after I removed some of the bloat ware (skype and the anti-virus). There are no visible ready lights, so you don't know at any point of time what's going on or even if the computer is actually on. No owner's manual, not even a cd, so it's hard to get started. Some of the problems may be the operating system, Win 10. Maybe w/ Win 7 it would speed up a bit and be easier to use. As it stands now it is virtually worthless to me and I can't send it back as it was a birthday gift bought in February gifted in March, the day before the return date. Oh well, it might make an OK door stop or boat anchor. Oh yeah, it does have a beautiful screen but that's all I can say nice about this POS.
I like the color. It is much bigger than I expected. My own runs perfect. I like everything about mine. Awesome computer to have especially for a certified refurbished unit. It was just like new.
Its a beautiful laptop, but its slow as hell and won't stay connected to internet no matter what network I connect to, so its basically worthless!
GREAT DEAL !.
For a inexpensive laptop it is a great bargain. The screen is great. I recommend removing the Bloatware and a little tuning it seems to run great....
I like it!
This computer took 17 minutes to start up. Called Microsoft to help me optmize the startup. First we needed to update Windows. Spent 4.5 hours on the phone with Microsoft trying to update Windows. Could not do it. Didn't want to attempt a repair with Microsoft so returned the laptop. I bought a new, not refurbished HP and it works fine.
Love It... First time refurbished
Returned. Item not as described.
I love it ! It works like a dream . And i love the design of it and the fact that itâs touch screen . I only wish there was more information on how to start the free year of Microsoft because when i emailed them about it they still couldnât provide any info . I also wish the hp warranty was longer .
Supposed to come with Office 365 for a year with no info on how to download it or log in to it. If you go to Microsoft's site, they want $99 for it. Seems very slow, and hangs up a lot. I'm gonna give it one day and if it doesn't respond like a laptop should it's going back. Also the HP support assistant pops up and hangs the computer.
Purchased 2/27/18 now 3/30/18. Does not connect to WiFi. Will not purchase again.
This is an excellent product with plenty of bells and whistles. After getting familiar with windows-10,i now enjoy the convenience of a product with all the capabilities which it incorporates.
Got it for my grandson and he loves it. Fast delivery.
Slow processor and the item is not a quality build. I ended up returning it because the batter was poor.
Alot of laptop for the money. The best laptop deal on the market.
Just ok. Doesnt seem to hold a charge. We have to use it plugged in.
It came without charger and connecting cable. Please call me and confirm when I will get these items.I can charge and test the computer only after I get theseWhen are you sending the charger and connecting cable??
As described!
This is a really nice laptop for the price. It is light weight and seems to be made very well. My daughters have really enjoyed it as well. So far so good.
I returned this item. I had issues with this Windows 10 version knocking me off the internet. The new computer I subsequently purchased (an Acer) doesn't seem to have the problem; it does have WIN 10 but a different version.. My previous computer before trying this one had the same issues, so I wasn't interested in dealing with the same problems. Other than that, it was a fine computer, but I really on the internet with my home business, so this just wasn't up to part for that reason alone.
I like that we received it quickly. Glad to have a CD player. Don't like the way it plugs in. Love the touch screen
Pros:Very happy overall with this laptop. Excellent performance & built well. Comfortable and responsive keyboard. Keys highly visible in darkness with the red back-lit feature. The display resolution, color, clarity, and brilliance is amazing! This baby can handle existing games at highest settings as well as many of the new titles that are out/will be out. Can't wait to see how it handles Sea of Thieves next month, but based on the recommended game settings from the publisher, it looks like it will handle the game very well at medium to high settings.Cons (Not a big deal though):1. No light indicator to let you know if your Caps, Num or Scroll locks are on or off.2. While gaming, the fan gets pretty loud after a while. Not really an issue if you wear a headset, but keep your left hand away from the exhaust vent. That air blowing out is HOT!Lastly, this is a complaint about Amazon regarding their shipping department. Would it KILL Amazon to use some padding?The laptop arrived in an Amazon box - Which contained the laptop in it's original packaging and a little bit of brown paper. I opened it to find it damaged (Not sure if it was from shipping or from the Manufacturer when packing). Sent it back for a replacement. 2 days later the replacement arrived.....Same kind of Amazon box with the product inside, only this time there was NO PACKING MATERIAL AT ALL. It was just the product box by itself.....Seriously Amazon?Luckily, the replacement was undamaged. As of this review, it's been up and running for 3 and a half days now without problems.First 2 photos are the first laptop that was damaged on arrival. The rest are of the replacement.
Unfortunately I had to return this laptop. Here's why:The machine I received will not charge the battery.The first day I received it, I charged it all day.After more than 8 hours of charging, I unplugged it, and took it into my den to use while I watched TV. I noticed that the battery indicated 100% charge several hours after I had unplugged it, and did not give that much thought except to think wow, this machine has a pretty strong battery.Sometime after that, the machine suddenly died.I plugged it in, and the next morning noticed that it had not charged, and the battery icon had an "X" in it. Clicking on the battery icon, it showed "Battery not Present". Picture of this attached. Mind you, I had only received the laptop the day before this.I contacted ASUS by chat, and they had me do some stuff -- screen shot of what I did is attached. This allowed the battery to charge back up, but exactly the same thing happened again, that is, once the battery ran down, the battery would not charge, and the battery indicated 100% until it ran down.I contacted ASUS again, and this time they had me restore the OS using Windows Recovery - Restore this PC. This again allowed the battery to charge, but again it indicated 100% until it ran down, then indicated the battery was not present and will not charge.As long as the laptop is connected to the power supply, it works fine. Very fast, good display, etc.Obviously there is something wrong with it, so I returned it.0 stars for the laptop, but ASUS service was easy to get in touch with and did what they could. And Amazon made the return very easy.0 stars for Amazon packing. They just put the box the laptop came in into another box with no packing material except a piece of crumpled up paper. The box the laptop in was free to bounce around in this box, although it was not damaged that I could see. I have to wonder if the packing at the Amazon fulfillment center is completely done by robots? Perhaps the time and money saved is greater than than the shipping damage.
Love it. Got it on sale after knowing I'd not be able to afford a 17" with the graphics I wanted to last for a few years. Excellent screen viewable from all angles and at least 10' away with colors still looking the same even at 45 degree angle and over 6' away. Keyboard feels awesome, very tactile with a nice feel to know when you activate a key. Sound is at least average, but I usually use headphones which get plenty loud too. It's not filled with bloatware which is a nice surprise, does have software preloaded but it's things people might actually use like Office, Polaris Office and some gaming stuff which is reasonable as people are likely to use this for gaming. The build feels solid and there's just a fraction of an inch of lift from the bottom when lifting just the lid. I like the arrow keys are shifted down just a bit to make them easier to find/use. Track pad feels really smooth and nice to use, it looks like it doesn't have dedicated left/right but it does they are just recessed and surprisingly easy to use and feel great.Not a fan of red back lit keyboard, but red seems to be the color of the moment and you can turn it off, which is great in a lit area otherwise you better know where your keys are. My one complaint is there's no End key outside of the one on the Numberpad with Num Lock off. I use it a lot in both typing and spreadsheets to get around with just the keyboard. There is still the End on the Num pad, but that's Num Lock off, End, Num Lock on (to avoid future errors especially which spreadsheets). Also doesn't have Page Up/Down buttons except on the Num Pad.
Purchased the 17" GTX 1050 ti version and cracked it open to upgrade to an NVME system drive and 16Gb of Ram. As you can see, the laptop doesn't match the advertised pictures with dual fans and heatsinks. This machine, before replacing the thermal compound, was throttling constantly under load while gaming and GPU benchmarking. After replacing the thermal paste, even with Asus Gaming app running fans at 80% constantly (a number generally associated with longevity of fan bearings) I'm still seeing CPU temps of 90Â°+ on medium load games like Warframe. Because of the layout, all of the heat is being transferred over the top of the GPU and the system is consistently warmer than I would have expected considering I was expecting a dual fan layout and this is one of the reasons I purchased the laptop.Heat is just the tip of the iceberg, though. After adding 8Gb of memory and a 250Gb NVME drive and installing Windows on the new drive is where the nightmare began. The picture in the description lists this as an FX503, the label identifies as FX73VE but dxdiag reports this as a ROG gaming laptop. So finding the right driviers was a bit of a nightmare and I still believe as of writing this that the display is either 60hz or it's not being recognized as 120hz, which is how it's advertised, again.For $800 this isn't a bad machine with about $200 and an hour of time thrown at it. Out of the box it has plenty of I/O, decent upgradability, a good processor and a decent GPU. However, with stock cooling, mechanical HDD, and 1050 ti don't expect this to perform at a 5 star level. As others have said, spend $300-400 more on something with more memory, SSD, GTX 1060, and better cooling.
Did not buy this for gaming but wanted an adequate mid priced laptop for photo and movie editing. Good specification for the price and does what I wanted it to do with ease. Boots fast, runs quiet and no more waiting for lightroom or photoshop to load. Hybrid drive is a nice compromise, plenty of storage and quick. Seems well made and I do the like the red backlit keyboard, should keep me satisfied for a few years.
Bought this for my son and he loves it. He plays League of Legends and other online games and has no problems. We use the upgraded internet of 250Mbps and will probably upgrade to the 400Mbps soon. Great Laptop and would recommend for anyone that plays games or streams a lot.
I've been using this computer for the last few days since mine is down (sick, in the laptop hospital). I really like it. I installed a ssd and had to reinstall windows. That took awhile, but that's my internet issue. Other than that, it is working amazingly well. I've only played Sims 3 on it and it did not run hot for me. I also didn't notice the fan noise. The keyboard is responsive and stayed cool to the touch. The audio is pretty loud and clear. So far so good.
WHAT A FANTASTIC LAPTOP ! All software loaded without any issues. It is blazing fast, and the back-lit keyboard is great.There are no issues at all. This was my initial assessment.After using this laptop for 3 weeks, I can say without a doubt that it is THE BEST laptop I have ever owned. It is super-fast. It boots quickly, and the programs load fast. The display is beautiful.
The laptop is great. It's not the best gaming laptop you can find in market, but it is definitely worth a 5 star in this price. The only things I hate about it is there's no indicator light to show if your caps lock is on. Everything is fine except for that, it could be annoying sometime.
Good value in terms of price to performance ratio. My only gripe involves the outdated LED display which is too bright/cloudy and also the fan is too loud when running high quality graphics.
The GPU is giving rendering errors frequently, but it may be a problem on nvidia's side rather than ASUS. The specs on the laptop are good, but the mechanical harddrive is incredibly slow.
Very decent laptop. I give it a 4 star because it lacks an NumLock indicator. You don't get a light or screen notification anywhere to let you know about this. But aside from this everything is perfect. I had to buy a separate sdd and perform a system migration to it so I didn't lose my original windows 10 copy it came with.
I know this is a gaming computer, but I purchased it for video editing. It is very fast, I love how fast it powers up, and I've had no problems at all so far. (I've had it for a month!)
First had battery issues 2 weeks out. I spoke to tech support. They were able to fix it by having me unplug it for 10 minutes.It worked perfect after that, Now two weeks later and it wont hold a charge expect by being plugged in. Too late to return.
Amazing laptop only reason I didnât give it 5 stars was because the fan gets very hot and loud. Other than that you get your moneyâs worh. Overwatch friendly -.-
Doesn't hold charge, don't know if mine is broken or not but if it's left unplugged for even a few hours it has no battery and will have to be left plugged in to use, pretty much useless as a laptop
With an I5 core it can run slow when it actually works. Within a month it crashed completely.
I don't like to give 1-star reviews but unfortunately I have to for this one. In addition to running very, very slowly, it has had consistent issues when I use it. Sometimes, it'll shut down on me while in use, sometimes it won't open apps (such as steam which is the primary purpose of purchasing this gaming laptop), sometimes it won't recognize that I have headphones inserted, as examples. Overall it has performed very poorly and slowly, not something I expected from a new laptop of this quality. The graphics are excellent, and the performance while in-game is strong for the most part, but outside of that, my old Lenovo laptop I've had the past five years runs better.
Honestly for me, there were no bad things about this laptop. Would 10/10 recommend it to anyone who wants to either start pc gaming or even veteran gamers.
Overall I'm fairly satisfied with this laptop. It can handle anything I throw at it such as battlefront 2, on medium/high settings, WoW, league of legends, dragon age Inquisition, mass effect Andromeda and others.Okay so the stuff I have issues with, with most games the fans kick on really quickly, and thats good, but thing is the y are loud and have a barely tolerable medium high pitched whine. If you put the speakers to about 3/4 up and or have headphones your okay but I'm not down with it. Next is the backlit keyboard, which looks dope by the way. Unlike most laptops this keyboard only stays lit for a period of time unless your gaming. It's cool if your using a power saver mode but if your in a dark room an FPS ya may have a moment where you press the wrong key. Lastly but not least, the hard drive which is a Terabyte of hybrid storage, is okay, but if you truly want to have a really great experience with this you should get an M.2 drive and stick it in their and install windows on it so the OS is fast. The fans are loud but they do work well and especially with the overboost feature.Overall I enjoy gaming on this, there's just a few things that I had to get used to. This is mostly due to me buying a pure Asus ROG. This shares the body of the ROG Strix but it's components are slightly different. I give it four out of five stars.
As I got my laptop, I wanted to upgrade to a spare 2 TB HDD, however, it was difficult but decided to leave it alone. I just wished they would have made a panel to access the hard drive and ram more easily. The second flaw was as I powered it up, I pressed the enter button to accept the windows language and the menu key for the bottom right pops off. How is it that when you manufacture a laptop, you don't properly check to make sure the product you're selling is 100% structured??? I expected more...UPDATE (4/18/18)I got my RMA service done within a week plus another due to shipping complications but Asus definitely took good care of the laptop. Its like they gave me a new laptop. They included so many gifts and special drivers in the pc as I booted it up. Unfortunately, I had to lose it all since I am upgrading to a 2 TB HDD but I can download all the stuff via their support site. As for the menu key, its 100% fixed. Can't wait to travel and game in this laptop
Great machine; this replaced an earlier ASUS model
Battery life is bad but everything is good
Every now and then it slows up
Very bright screen - high contrast. Makes a nice gaming computer. Aluminum backing for the screen.Cons: Red LED keyboard. Blue would provide better illumination and a more contast against the dark keys. Would have liked an all aluminum case (personal preference). The case it comes in is very strong, however.
I ordered the 17.3" version and all I can say is simply I am in love! this is my new baby lol. The finish is very fingerprint prone but is very beautiful if kept clean.I love the feel of the keyboard and touch pad. screen is beautiful also.. I can't find any fault in it... Hope it lasts me for a long time.
I have been trying to use my laptop for the last thirty minutes. I have been sitting here watching it update. It finally turned on after 20 minutes and it was so slow that it took ten minutes to go from the login screen, to the desktop screen, to the desktop screen with all my icons. Iâve had the laptop for about three weeks and have maybe used it four times, for maybe six hours maximum. I bought this laptop after extensive research and I am sorely dissatisfied .
for the prize it's a great deal, works great for me and easy to upgrade when you get the money. I when from a ASUS gl551 15 inch which I love to this Laptop both ASUS and love them they both work great as long as you take care and I do
It's banging.
Great computer.
Amazing laptop! Adding an SSD drive and setting it as the OS drive made a big difference.
Awsome laptop
Not as advertised. Does not have easy access to back to change hard drive or RAM.Disappointed..
Product received was new and as stated in description.
Fantastic laptop works great fancy and fast
Best Laptop for this Money.
Was literally malfunctioning out of the box. The screen is flickering, pixels look very weird, there's a shadow of previous tabs that were open, is extremely dark. Took almost 6 hours to update as I thought that might be the problem, but was not. Very annoying as I was relying on using this for a job and will have to send back now - likely to buy another brand.
I was so happy to have this, but now, I am having an issue with it. It's been two days since I trying to optimize it and now it wont boot up normally. It shows me the Asus logo when ypu first turn it on and wont show me my desktop anymore.
Very good laptop
Slow, lags, not a gaming laptop!!! It should out perform my 5 year old Desktop. In War Thunder and PubG this thing can't perform. It lags and crashes. I will be returning it!!! Very Disappointing!!!
One of my favorite laptop's yet
PROS:+ I'm in love with the chassis texture which is nice to touch and hides oil stains to a degree (see Cons)+ Comfortable humanized keyboard, plus full numpad, makes touch typing a breeze+ Speedy SSD with cold boot times of less than 10s (see Neutrals)+ Screen boasts a number of comfortable viewing angles (see Neutrals)+ Removable battery with decent life--a single full charge will yield close to 7 hours for normal computing tasks and up to 5 for watching videos/movies+ Fan is whisper quiet when it kicks onNEUTRALS:* Skimpy storage at only 128GB (250GB would've been much better without pushing the cost much higher), but I guess there's still plenty of room if you're a cloud-happy consumer* Half-size left/right arrow keys--which is a bummer for me since I often use keyboard shortcuts which include those arrow keys and sometimes find myself hitting empty space* Ultra-low profile keys with minimal travel, though it does still have that satisfying click as you type, which require acclimation if you're coming from higher profile keys or mechanical keyboard* No backlighting on the keyboard--I know it doesnât say anywhere that it has this feature, but it doesnât say that it doesnât either...Iâm just making it extra clear for the curious* While the screen has several nice viewing angles, the colours can get a bit washed out and, depending on what you're doing, images aren't crisp (not the point that it renders this laptop unusable, but it may be problematic if you do a lot of photo/video editing/viewing)* This thing takes its time to recharge requiring upwards of 3-4 hours for a full recharge from 10%* Speakers are what you'd expect from a laptop and get even muddier when you kick up the volume--that said, this is a Neutral rather than Con as this seems to be an area most laptops fail miserably inCONS:- Trackpad and keys are a little too eager to absorb the oils from your fingers/hands, and while it's less visible on the textured chassis, it's still there and slightly more difficult to clean up- Speaking of the trackpad, straight out of the box it was incredibly sluggish and imprecise (i.e. you could be sliding your finger across it, but the mouse stubbornly refuses to move)--I dug around and found the Dell trackpad settings which helped somewhat, though not much- If you hope to install a bit more memory (which youâll want to do if youâre a heavy multi-tasker), or even swap out the SSD for a larger/faster one, youâll discover firsthand how needlessly painful it is to remove the rear panel- This is one hefty beast, not bad if you're keeping it on a desk, but could be annoying if you must lug it around daily- The never-ending bloatware is brutal, mostly due to Microsoft, especially if you set up multiple accounts (it's like zombie software just pops up out of nowhere despite having uninstalled it from the Admin account)NOTES:This is not a gaming machine and never will be no matter how much memory or storage you throw at it. But for the price this isnât a bad starter machine. You donât need to add anything in order to have a spry little workhorse. It may, however, be lightweight for a business machine (unless your business doesnât go beyond emailing, writing a few memos, and basic blogging).Iâm almost tempted to compare this with myÂ Acer E5-575-33BM, but wonât because these laptops are in slightly different leagues. This one is much more lightweight feature-wise though similarly specâed. Not to mention, itâs faster than the stock Acer.This is a great choice if you have a kid still in school or heading off to college (or if youâre heading off to college yourself) and you want a no fuss no muss laptop that will get the job done. That said, if you donât mind investing another hundred dollars to have a mini powerhouse, then Iâd recommend getting the Acer plus memory and SSD upgrades. (Iâll leave my link to the review in the comments.)Over time I may update this review to add or note any significant changes. If, however, you have any questions before then about the product or my experiences with it, please leave a comment and Iâll do my best to answer.
Commodity laptops have come a long way. If you don't mind big, heavy and somewhat ugly you can get a nicely performing computer for a low price. Here's one from Dell that is a decent buy.

This is a great basic "no frills" laptop, it has everything you need and want for everyday emailing, watching videos schoolwork etc..It even has a dvd drive which is becoming increasingly rare these days! BTW, if you like to watch videos the battery will give you about 5 hours of movies. For normal browsing, emailing etc... you get close to 7 hours of use which is good, imo and the screen is nice and crisp for watching videos.With the 128 gb drive being a solid state drive it is MUCH faster than the average basic laptop so that is a nice upgrade from a basic slow 5400 rpm drive. This can be upgraded with more ram and a larger drive but this is not designed for gaming so the 128gb ssd it comes with should work fine for the average person/student or light business user. I would rather it be a 256gb ssd (who wouldn't?) but that is why this is lower priced, the more you add upgrades the more it would/will cost! So you need to decide do you want an efficient basic laptop for everyday use or one that costs more with all the bells and whistles?I am rating this on what it comes with and how well it performs. If you want a higher end laptop this is not the one for you!I have large hands and the keyboard fits comfortably into daily use, now it will never compare to a full size keyboard that you use with a PC but as far as laptops go it is nice, the keys are low profile but you definitely can feel the click of your typing action. Easy to transport as it weighs in at just under 5 pounds. The case is nice and sturdy with a matte finish that resists fingerprints which is nice also.
This is an alright computer that gets the job done. It offer excellent visual fidelity for viewing videos and listening to music. It also offers a full keyboard for functionality with making documents. It even has a DVD drive for video viewing.Beyond that, it is kind of only good for stationary desktop replacement type of work. the comptuer reminds me of the type we used 10+ years ago, the big clunky ones that are laptops in that they could sit in your lap, but you honestly wouldnt want them too because they are so heavy and big. Unlike todays thinner frame lighter SSD ones that have ditched disc drives, this one opted to put it back in, went with a big screen, and no touch screen features to deliver the maximum in price reduction. I think its great as a "my first laptop for college" for some folks but I wouldnt really use it as an actual portable pc unless Im always going to be able to put it on a desk or table.Viewing angle of the screen could be better, you really only get a good view if youre sitting head on, but if youre sitting even a few degrees over center you get the washed out view.
This is a solid laptop.Pros:Instead of a password it uses my fingerprint to unlockNice, big screenSleek and thin and tucks away easily beside my deskGood sound qualityCons:Sometimes a little slow when it starts upDoesn't always recognize my fingerprintSome websites (like netflix) always seem to crash on my laptop
So, this was the worst purchase I've made in a long time. This is the 3rd refurbished PC I've bought, the 1st I've ever purchased from Amazon. When I received it I had 5 days to customize it and transfer all of my file from my older laptop to give that one to my daughter for her birthday, and use this one as my new laptop.First, when I turned the laptop on, it wouldn't boot. It said there was no boot device found. Big "UH OH!" for me. So then I did some diagnostics and found that the hard drive was there, with absolutely nothing on it. So I thought... ok, I'll access the restore partition that all Dell's have and restore it to the original factory OS. Well... no partition could be accessed. So I knew there was an even bigger problem going on.I then created a partition-restore image to use to repair the damaged partition and restore factory images. Well.... the restore partition was so corrupt that it could not be repaired.So then I called Dell and explained the issue. They couldn't believe someone would sell me a "Refurbished PC" claiming to be in good order and with Windows 10 installed on it, and have it be so horrible. They referred to it as a paperweight. I even sent them the link to the item I purchased and they laughed at what I had sent to me. A complete inoperable piece of junk.I asked if they could send me a restore disk and they said that I had to realize that all drivers would be gone and a disc would not be read. But I could program a USB to restore the PC to original images as long as the computer would allow itself to be repaired.It took me 12 hours to get Windows 7 on the laptop, and an additional 5 hours repairing and restoring drivers to get it to work even semi-well.I did not have time to send the laptop back and wait for a better one (hopefully) to show up. My daughter's birthday was coming.And now that the laptop is working well because I did what the seller should have done in the first place, I'm not sending it back. They SHOULD be paying me for the technical work I did though.I am SO irritated at this purchase.This definitely shows me though that NO ONE is checking to make sure the refurbished PC's actually work. Just that they power on.
Buyer beware! This was supposed to be "like new." While the screen was in great shape, but one of the USB ports was severely damaged and unusable and the speaker cover underneath was also damaged. It worked the first time I used it for a couple of hours then wouldn't power up the 2nd time I wanted to use it even though it was completely charged. I have returned this.
Great price! No instructions on how to activate Windows 10 Pro.. After install Windows says the software was not activated. Activation on bottom of laptop had a Microsoft stamp over the first several alpha numeric characters! Took me some time to figure out that if you were real careful, you could scratch the seal off and recognize te remainingactivation code. Even the tech people at Amazon didn't know this. Very annoying!
Disappointed in performance. Product write up says laptop has a core i5 processor and we received a core i3.
At this time I can not give an honest review of item because I have not been able to use the product yet. I purchased the product for a friend of mine for her birthday. Last night, 3 May 2018, I finally opened up the product to get tit setup for her, but every time I turn on the computer I receive the following message: No Bootable devices. Strike F1 to try reboot. F2 for setup. F3 Diagnostics.I run the diagnostics and get the message that there is no Hard Drive installed. Therefor, if there is no way for me to fix it on my own I will have no other choice but to return this item.
This is a good little computer. I have problems with the cursor bouncing around, but I haven't had time to check in to it.
Refurbished computers are an excellent deal from amazon. Good price they work like new anyone can afford a computer. This computer feels well made and is made of sturdy metal and plastic. Now it is working perfect.
the screen is smaller than 14.1, more like 13.1. Spend a little more if you can to buy a better one.
One of the first things I did when I got this computer is replace the hard drive with an SSD. This was actually pretty painless to do. From there, I just reinstalled Windows.I bought this computer mainly for the processor. Since one of the other reviewers noted that their computer came with an i3, and I was buying this purely because it came with an i5, that's the first thing I checked. To my surprise, the processor in my computer was slightly better than the one advertised. My computer came with an i5 3340 (2.7/3.4ghz) which is better than the 3320m it was supposed to come with (2.6/3.2ghz). I intend on using this computer for programming so I installed Visual Studio, SSMS, etc. With the SSD they all load within a few seconds, and I'm fairly happy with the performance.As I'm writing this review, I'm pretty happy with the keyboard. This was a business class laptop, and you can definitely tell from the construction. It feels pretty solid.There are some cons to take into consideration however:The maximum resolution on the display is 1376 x 768. My old laptop, which I'm going to be replacing with this one, was 1920 x 1080. So it's a bit disappointing that I'm going to be losing some screen real estate. I intend on having the programs open with the ebooks next to them. So the screen resolution will make it harder to have them side-by-side. In addition to the resolution, the screen is not touch screen.I was having an issue connecting to my wifi for some reason. The issue was fixed when I reinstalled Windows on the SSD. I'm not sure if it was due to using the SSD or due to reinstalling Windows. But whatever the case may be, that fixed the issue.The battery life on the computer looks like its a maximum of two hours. On my previous laptop it was 5 hours. So something like this is a bit disappointing, especially from a computer that's supposed to be a business class laptop. You may have to replace the battery with another one online if you hope to have a decent battery life.As someone from an accounting background, the lack of a ten-key is disappointing.Lastly, the computer ships with 32-bit Windows. While this probably won't be an issue for most people, it does prevent you from using all of the ram that the computer ships with. And, for someone like me, it may also limit performance.Overall, I'm fairly happy with this computer. I bought this mainly for processing power and I sure got it. However, depending on what your needs are, this may not be the computer for you. But I think it'd be hard to go wrong with this computer. A review from PCMag from around 4 years ago notes that this computer sold for around $830. So you're getting quite a good value paying significantly less than that.
So far so good - I needed help getting started and they were right there to help me.
Within a month, the charger quit working. The wifi adapter needs troubleshooting about 3 times per day. I bought this 4 months ago, had said charger replaced... And today, while trying to troubleshoot the AC Adapter, the computer decided to not let me back on without reformatting. So I am losing every little piece of garbage I've contributed to this dumpster fire in the last 4 months. My advice... Take whatever Amazon is charging for this abomination, get it in cash... Then proceed to set it on fire. It will be a better use of your money.
I received the laptop and the windows operating system needed to be activated. I didn't receive the code key to activate it. I have been trying to get in touch with the seller but have not had any luck yet. Without being able to activate the operating system, the laptop does not have a lot of value..
This computer was not refurbished at all it was factory reset which does not get rid of viruses. Within the first week it ran slow, and died within an hour which means a bad battery again not referbished. Last I went to Google and got a pop up with voice recording saying I need to call this hotline immediately or it would shut my computer down. Long story short it was a scam from malware still present on a supposedly refurbished computer. Do not buy from them!!
NO POWER PACK!!. What good is a 3hr computer worth? Astonished.
The product meet my expectations. I use it, basically, to surf the internet and itâs a very fast computer for the price !It has very few signs of having been used. The appearance is 90 - 95% newCons.Charger looks very cheap and its noisyIts an old model so it's heavy, but seems to be strong.Touch pad doesnât Work - or is not activated (I do not care and do not try to fix it)
GETTING WINDOWS 10, IN YOUR SET UP, THE UPGRADE IS NOT SIMPLE, TRYING TO ACTIVATE WINDOWS TEN, FROM MICROSOFT. IT IS NOT JUST HAVING THE KEY, BECAUSE WINDOWS DOES NOT SHOW WHERE TO KEY IN UPGRADE.
My new computer works great. I owned Office 2013 apps which loaded easily. All is great. Just what I want for my second computer. JoeM
I love this laptop. I had a Chromebook, but it lacked most of the features that I love about Dell and Microsoft.
Great little laptop, just like new so far. Works great! Good follow up by seller.
We are very pleased with the computer and the price.
The computer was fine. No problems. The operating system was unauthorized. I had to buy windows 10pro. What was a great deal? Now not so much.
one of the best I've owner and I've had several . I will never buy anything other then from them.
Computer has visible wear and tear to outer cover, very scratched up. Has crusty looking food or something on it. Not what I was expecting for refurbished like new computer. Lesson learned. Hope when I fire it up it performs better.
As advertised. Works well.
Did not work
Exactly as advertised.
The item appeared to be in good order. It just switches off within the first 5mins. of operation. Only when the charger is plugged in can I use the device. It has a faulty battery. The battery gets hit and also doesn't hold charge for very Long
I like the laptop only issue that I have is the mouse pad does not work I had to use a plug in mouse in order for me to scroll....
good computer fast the only issue I have did not come with webcam.
I'm liking the computer.The battery is garbage.It will not hold a charge and only last 30 minutes after a full charge.
I like my lap top, when I needed it most, Amazon delivered quickly. thanks.
Works super
I just got my laptop and the laptop is all covered with bubble wrap. Everything looka new and now using it without internet.
This was a great buying experience. Product arrived quickly and was new and everything as promised. It's an awesome product for the price. I would highly recommend this seller!
I just bought two laptops. One for me and one for my mom for her birthday present. I love this laptop it is easy to use and I don't have any problems.
love love love this laptop it works great very profeshinable also
Arrived on time. I activated Windows 10 successfully with the code at the back of the Laptop. Good quality for this price.
Great size, fast, no nonsense laptop that has everything you need for business.
Am excelent experience looks like new, feels like new everything work perfect
The computer functions as expected. My biggest complaint is that I ordered Windows 7 and received Windows 10.
who sales a laptop without the complete adapterunable to charge to even see if the dang thing works.
computer crashed after a few days and would not power on
Exactly what I needed. Great product.
could not connect to the internet after a week.
I love it . it handles all my needs easy set up bought a second one for my grandson
Your product is working better than expected. When need arises I will get another
Product would not boot up... Claimed to be tested and certified. BUYERS BEWARE
I bought 6 of this kind machines to teach my kid's friends AI programming. One of them is returned item for sure since the machine is half setup and the power adapter does not fit. I wonder why seller did that to me. I have to ask my assistant to find one usable somewhere else. Very disappoint.
Great job. Exceeded expectation
I like is size.I dislike no Microsoft instolled
Little slow but ok for the price
All products are very good!!
Just what i expected. Nice laptop
works great
Very disappointed!
Win 10 updated properly. Seems to be working well. Battery is basic and needs charging OFTEN.
Had one hour and got hacked. Had to take to computer shop to fix it and load windows. Tech said the windows program was illegal. Laptop is heavy!
Excellent, like-new quality for being a refurbished item. Runs great, an awesome budget laptop for a student. No problems so far, would purchase again. It also has nice sound quality, which was a bonus. Exactly as pictured.
Great! Did exactly what I needed it to do! Excellent price works very well. Was a little complicated to work but that's probably because I'm stupid when it comes to technology! I highly recommend.
Horrible - bought 3 and sent three back!From power issues to performance issues - please buy a different lp!
I bought this computer as a back up for my radio station. I use it as a remote laptop for events when I am out in the field because everytime I would unplug the other to bring it out it would mess up my audio settings etc. So I bought a 2nd one having had no problems with the first...As soon as I bought this thing I have had issues. For one, the computer WILL NOT TURN ON without being plugged in. If it is plugged in, it starts up fine. And yes the battery is fully charged etc, at least I think it is as it wont turn on without its power plug. But I have had it at 100% from the beginning.. Anyway.2nd issue. When I go to type in my password to start the computer the letters never show up. I just ghost type it now and it starts but it is annoying that the dots wont show up to acknowledge that it is registering letters. You usually know things are set to go when you see the cursor and the text input so its just annoying to not have that.3rd issue. It is slow as molasses! I was thinking maybe I installed something that messed it all up but from reading the other reviews, that is probably not the case. Ugh. And there is so much storage space left on it so I know that is not it. I literally dont keep any music, photos or anything like that on it to make sure it runs smooth for broadcasts (I do the same with the other PC) and it is still slow from the beginning.4th issue. I feel like everytime I turn the damn thing on its "installing updates, please do not turn off the computer" or something like that. Very frustrating when you need to turn on your computer and get right to work.Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because when it's working, it works well! But there are just some really annoying problems that make me want to throw it out a window.I dont know, maybe I will sell this thing and get a better computer soon.
Just turn on my new asus laptop looking good so far update fast with Cortana help pretty much doing the job no complains yet I hope so I will give 4 stars for now when I look into it more today and everyThing is as expected then Iâll rate 5 stars
I just bought this laptop and I like it. Good performance laptop. Easy to set up. Has good sound too.
Bought it Feb. 23rd. Today is May 31st; it won't even turn on. Very disappointed.
Very sleak an pretty good lightweight an easy to set up I use it mostly for work an spreadsheets with some internet search work still learning what it will so but for the most part I am pleased with the purchase
Plugged it in, charged it, set it up per the quick start, and it worked for a whole day! I was looking for a bargain and bought the price. BIG MISTAKE! I really got what i paid for.
For years I've purchased Asus computers as they were fast, well made and great high performance laptops. This laptop was trouble from the start. After days of trying to get all the updates properly installed and trying to get the wifi to work, I decided to do a full reset. This didn't work, and broke windows completely, getting it stuck in a start up loop. Very disappointed in this computer.
I have had this computer for 4 months and it has already died and will not come on.
Absolutely terrific
Within two weeks my computer begin to shut off by itself. Which put me in a bad position I had just started a master's program which is the reason why I bought the computer. I'm very disappointed.
It started turning off out of nowhere unless you have plugged in to the wall its slow looks nice but I am not happy
Poor Performance, Freezes not enough memory.
my asus does not read read cd's only Rom and i bought it in April 2018 thinking it is varranty for a year but not so. i really like to return it tbut amazon says return return deadline is closed closed.
for the price it will do. slow machine but for daily office 365 it does the job.
If I unplug it, it automatically shuts down, it makes too much noice when I turn it on and it runs slow. It was a bad choice
Complete junk! Do not buy! To keep it on it had to be plugged in, now the whole computer does not come on! Itâs only 3 months old!!!
Horrible quality. Would shut off repeatedly unless plugged in. Would never recommend.
The battery does not hold a charge. The computer must be plugged in to operate.
This laptop goes off when it's been used
Perfect for the price.
came Broke
Love it
Not a fan
Peace. Great laptop!
The battery will not hold a charge, so this isn't really a lap top. I like the ASUS brand, I just think I got a bad battery.
My computer came with a bad battery
Gave it as a gift, ran fast and did what we needed for the price
When you purchase this laptop, allow yourself a full day to set it up. First you will need about 3 hours to charge the battery, then Windows updates will take a couple of hours. Then it will take some time to get rid of the junk that all new computers come with (I'm not a gamer, so lots of games had to go). If you are a Windows 10 pro, then you should be good to go. The last Windows computer I had was XP, so Win 10 took a while to get used to. I won't trade my Mac for anything, but I was at the point where I needed a new laptop to take on appointments with clients, and since they are all PC users it only made sense to go with a Windows machine.The computer isn't really gold at all, but more of a silvery color. I was worried that it would be flashy and "in your face" gold, but it is very subtle.The caps lock button doesn't let you know it is on, and that can get annoying when you accidentally hit it. There is also no separate numerical keypad, but maybe that is normal for laptops. I am more of a desktop user.Fingerprint technology is great, although about half the time it doesn't recognize me the first time and I have to do it again. Still, much faster than typing a password. Startup is super fast, literally only a few seconds. I was initially only looking for a $400 or so laptop since this won't get much use, but I am glad I splurged and got something with a much better processor and a SSD for the operating system.This laptop weighs next to nothing, and the screen is about the thickness of a few pieces of cardstock. Really, it's very impressive. I am still on my first battery charge, and have probably gotten 5-6 hours out of it, but it is warning me now that it is low.The only downside so far is no DVD drive. But I picked up an external Asus Zen Drive (SDRW-08U7M-U) for $29 and it works great. I don't need it often, but my iMac doesn't have a drive either, so now I am all set for both computers since it is plug and play.Overall, I'm very impressed and glad that I chose this model out of the 40+ I looked at on amazon before deciding. I was worried that it wouldn't have enough RAM, and apparently your warranty is void if you put more in. But so far it is very adequate. If, after trying to run Photoshop and a bunch of other programs all at once it seems to be lagging, then I will update my review.
This is a punchy little laptop for its price that pleasantly surprised me in a lot of ways, and disappointed me in others. Part of my amazement with some of it probably has to do with the fact that my everyday workhorse laptop is a couple of years old, now. It certainly feels outdated next to this thing! I'll start with the good.* The laptop is REALLY light. When the box came, my husband didn't believe there could really be a laptop inside. He thought I was joking when I told him that's what it was. Weight doesn't honestly matter to me that much because I don't tote my laptop around, but if weight's an issue for you -- I really can't imagine laptops getting much lighter than this.* It turns on fast. Really fast. It has the OS on a solid state drive, and then a terabyte drive for storage, and the advantage to this is that solid state drives boot up super fast. This is a laptop that I'd have less of a problem with shutting down regularly, because turning it back on again takes about the same amount of time as it takes my laptop to come out of sleep mode. It's that fast.* It packs a fair amount of power without the heat. I've tested it on both Overwatch and Minecraft, and while it won't do either of those games at their best graphics settings (or even near-best), it does run them, and runs them smoothly. Moreover, it does so without producing a lot of heat, which surprised me. I have ordered a fancy chill pad to go with this laptop, since I anticipate it's going to be doing a lot of playing games with high graphics requirements, but I'm not seeing a lot of heat issues, even without it.* I thought the whole 'thin bezel' thing was silly until I saw this laptop's screen. It really does make my old laptop's screen seem outdated and clunky.* The speakers are decent, for what they are. They don't have much of a bass, but they did bring out some things in the other registers of the music I was listening to that impressed me. If you just want 'thump, thump, thump', they're not the speakers for you, But they might hold up okay, for music that has a little more than that going on.* Battery life was pretty decent. My roommate played Overwatch for hours on it and didn't realize that it wasn't plugged in.Now the bad:* This is the biggest concern I have with this laptop: The charger gets REALLY hot, and the wire itself seems flimsy. Between the hot charger and the flimsy wire, I'm expecting that my charger isn't going to last long. This isn't something I'm terribly comfortable leaving plugged in and walking away, either.* It comes with a lot of bloatware which you then have to go through and uninstall, which is kindof a pain. I don't get why companies do this. Also, it tries to push McAfee on you. I don't know why companies do this, either.* The speakers, while decent, could be better. But I've been saying that about my laptops for years, and have yet to own one where they ARE better. Still, when my iPhone has better sound, it feels like there's room for improvement.* Given how light and thin it is, I'd actually be a little afraid to tote this thing around too much without some kind of really protective case. It seems like it could get damaged too easily.
The laptop is a good value for what it provides. But, the screen and sound though fair are a little underwhelming. My older ASUS NV53V has much brighter screen and it sounds a lot better than this one.Everything else is top notch.----Update 7/19/2017I have used this laptop for a month now. To be fair, the display and sound are both as one would expect other laptops in the price bracket. In the era of rating inflation, I will up my rating to full 5 stars.
I've had this laptop for a few months and I love it a lot. It boots up in seconds and makes it so easy to get on task faster. I take it with me to school and its light enough that I don't feel like I'm carrying bricks. The battery lasts for 7 hrs and I usually dont charge it for two days bc I mostly use it for school work and only play one game on Steam. I don't really use it for heavy software, so I don't know how powerful it is for that.My main problem, though, is that sometimes the mousepad will stop working for a minute or two, or it will lag, but with my wireless mouse it's fine. It never lags or stops working. With the mousepad, I will try to right click but it will act like I intended to left click. It's frustrating, since I dont take my wireless mouse with me everywhere.Overall, I'm happy with it.
As reviewed: i5-8520U, 8GB DDR4 RAM and 1TB FireCuda Hybrid DriveI am very happy with this little laptop. Now I'm a person who can't stand the current trend towards tablets and touchscreens. I'm an engineering student and have a powerful desktop setup with two 21:9 monitors and regularly use both when I'm doing homework. I'm bothered by little details and expect higher performance than the average user. I needed a laptop to bring to my internship and carry with me to classes so I started looking for a small laptop with decent specs. For me this laptop matched everything I needed at a reasonable price.The main selling points for me were:-Small portable size-1080p ips screen-Decent cpu-Traditional layout-Subjectively a nice lookOnce I got my hands on it I had some thoughts on it. I was pleasantly surprised by how rigid the chassis feels despite being plastic. When I first started using it I wasn't sure I'd like the track pad, but in use I haven't noticed it at all, it's functioned exactly how I want it to. I consider the keyboard to be good, I'd prefer a more clicky experience but I can't fault anything about it. I feel fast and accurate typing on it. I installed Linux Mint on it and it runs perfectly without tweaking. The only feature that doesn't work on Mint is the fingerprint scanner. The hybrid drive is tolerable, not as quick as an SSD but I'm not bothered by it. The speakers have a decent sound for a laptop, albeit a higher max volume would be nice.In conclusion this laptop offered everything I wanted at a reasonable price. The functionality is on par with more premium offerings and it still maintains a solid build quality and good looks. If you're looking for a traditional laptop in this size I feel comfortable recommending it. I plan on updating this review if anything happens as time goes on to change my opinion of it.
This item was delivered on August 7th, 2017.As advertised this laptop is extremely light, and also very fast.I discounted a few stars because:- The colors are weird. Sometimes they look dull and other times they are just simply wrong. Tried using Intel HD Graphics Control Panel to match the settings with those of an older ASUS laptop but they seemed to be the same already.*After some Windows update, the colors are better but there's still a faint yellowish tint. Haven't tried BIOS reset yet.-The box it was delivered in alongside with an external CD reader was too big and with little to no protection. The order was handled by amazon, thought.Side note:- The plug is on the power brick, which might be inconvenient in some situations.- The audio is very nice, but the location of the speakers makes it so that they may get covered when typing.- NO CAPS LOCK LIGHT OR ALERT.
Replacing an 8 year old 17" Acer I ordered two different Acers only to return them both. This ASUS is GREAT. I love the configuration. Its Elegant, fast as hell and excellent choice for home computing. I use a MacBook Air at work and it has nothing on my new ASUS. Thanks to Amazon Prime and their return policy I've got the the perfect laptop for my needs.
Great laptop, the only thing that sucks is the battery life. The Wi-fi is super fast and connect's to router's far away, it boots up and shuts down in seconds. It is so fast!! Everything is so seemless on this computer. It has everything I could have ask for, with fair price tag. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who doesn't care about bringing their charger with them. I also suggest you buy a screen protector for this computer, it gets fingerprints on it so easily, it not one of those displays that has a plastic cover over it like touchscreen's.The display is very nice and has a HDR like feel to it, the color depth is great, very HD. I would recommend you buy a case or skin for this laptop, Amazon seller's sell a nice kit that comes with a skin and screen protector for 20$!! Overall good laptop so far.....
I spent a good amount of time searching for a decent laptop. I was stuck between a Mac and an ASUS, I ended up going with this laptop...obviously.I was looking for a laptop with a lot of memory, I'm becoming a coder so I needed plenty of space for my applications and programs. This laptop has it's pros and cons, just like anything else does. I'll start with pros: the look of it is very nice and sleek I must say, space, of course, is a big plus to me, I really just love ASUS as a whole honestly. Cons: the battery life isn't as spectacular as I would think it would be, the speakers are not that great, although I stream it through my tv so that doesn't really matter too much. Sometimes, it will randomly freeze, not too long but long enough.Overall I will say it's a good computer and I'm pleased with it. So depending on what you are looking for in terms of use, I would suggest this one if it would suit your needs.
I bought this laptop to decommission a Dall unit from 2012 which served me very well, also being a 15.6 inch. It was pretty difficult trying to find an all around good laptop that fit all my criteria but this one mostly does it all.Build - 80% of the body is a light sturdy plastic. The cover on the screen lid is a metal sheet that makes the lid pretty sturdy. I like the weight of it and it doesn't seem flimsy at all. It looks great and premium has a good selection of ports and a full size SD slot.Screen - I came from a 768p laptop which was the worst, so jumping to 1080p is an irreversible step I've taken. It's very vivid and colors aren't too saturated. The brightness is on the low side and would be nice if it could get about 20% brighter and it is a matte finish and gives very decent angles.Battery - My laptop is usually a desk queen, but I have tested the battery and it's decent. Light use would see about 6 hours of life and hard use would be closer to ~2 hours. The battery time estimate is erratic and sometimes seems inaccurate.Keyboard & Touchpad - So I was expecting to have to relearn a new keyboard but I guess since the main body is only slightly smaller than my last laptop so it's almost basically all the same spacing and everything. There is no function key lock which I seemed to take for granted previously but it's not a big deal. This keyboard is backlit and has 3 different levels of brightness, brightness 1 is enough for me so +1 to that. The keys aren't loose and typing on them is I think satisfying, they're somewhat quiet when pushed. People complain about how the power button is right next to the delete key, but for me personally I don't find this an issue at all.So the touch pad isn't good, your fingers don't slide over it easily, it grabs your finger basically.. really odd. It clicks great, but I won't be trying to use is at all. Would recommend a bluetooth mouse at all times. The fingerprint reader hasn't failed once.Processor & Speed - My model is the i7 7500U... It's basically an i5 7200U but with a .2Ghz quicker clock speed. Still dual core (bummer... thanks intel) and turbo boosts to 3.48Ghz. My base clock speed according to windows and also Intel's own driver software says 2.9Ghz. I wish I had gotten a model with an actual i7 instead of an i5 with an i7 badge. Fan noise is overall quiet until you run something that puts it at over 50% CPU usage but even still, it's manageable. Keep your power settings to 'Recommended' because 'High Performance' keeps it permanently turboboosted @ 3.48Ghz **The model with dedicated graphics would be worth it if you're more than a less than casual gamer.Wireless - Bluetooth is quick to reconnect a mouse when turning on the laptop. At the same spot my last laptop was, this one gets 'excellent' signal whereas my other one would get 'fair' to the sometimes 'good'.Speakers & Sound - So out of the box it doesn't sound good, neither do. You'll need to play music and then adjust the EQ to make it sound nice, but when you do it sounds as good as you can make it. My previous Dell laptop has the best speakers and the best EQ settings for headphones/speakers I've ever heard so I had to make lots of adjustments through the EQ of this laptop to make it sound as close as I can as my last computer. I got it pretty close but still not perfect, but I can live with it! The weird this is this computer comes with like 3 programs that control EQ which is very confusing, AND they all aren't mutually exclusive so they all build on each other. For this reason I recommend doing it though the 'ICEpower Audiowizard' program.
Unfortunately, I bought this out of necessity and the ASUS reputation of quality. None of which is shown in the design nor function of this computer. The battery life is atrocious. The sound quality is laughable at best, pathetic in the least. The camera is non-usable. The idea that it has two hard drives is pathetic. Everything goes to the boot drive (128 ssd) without a clear way to download apps to the bigger 1tb drive that this comes with as well. It reminds me of when phones came with the ability to attach a micro sd card but nothing could go on it that had any importance. I am very unhappy with this product but I am stuck with it because I bought it before I started classes and now I am struck with a device that makes a Chromebook look like a gaming PC. This plus the enforced addition of Microsoft Edge makes this a pathetic excuse for a computer. The best advice I can give you is do not buy this piece of crap unless you have the money to buy a functioning computer because the moment you decide to upgrade this POS you will violate the warranty.
I have had the computer for about 6 months now. So far, so good. I would give it a 4.5 stars, but as that is not an option will give it 4 stars. My main gripe so far for basic office use are: 1. while it charges super fast and perhaps that is the setting which will kill my battery, I don't think I ever would have gotten 8 hours of full work time on it, and 2. the power off button is right next to the delete key...I can not tell you how many times I have hit it by accident and switched off my computer unintentionally. However, I have not "yet" lost any valuable work as perhaps it is only putting the computer to sleep when I hit that the first time thereby saving my work. The mouse pad is not my favorite, but I did get used to it over time. Otherwise, very happy with this computer.
I'm not a computer wiz by any means so I actually had a friend of mine help me pick out a new laptop. He's very tech savvy and basically explained to me that this is probably the best bang for my buck.I don't do any gaming or social media on this. I just use it to buy more stuff I don't need on Amazon and write papers in Word. Maybe watch the occasional video. Pretty simple use so I don't know how it would handle a bigger workload.The extra hard drive is cool. Again I don't know much about computers so I just kinda have it but I'm sure if I ever wanted to download large files or anything that would be super convenient.The biometrics part is nice. You can only have one registered print so it has to be the same finger in the same spot every time which is probably my biggest complaint. I might be spoiled because my phone has I think 5 registered fingerprints so I can be in a different position or use my left hand if I want, where on this computer I can't.But I definitely like it. It's very fast and very clear. My old computer was a cheap Walmart computer so this blows it out of the water. I would definitely buy it again.
I was very nervous to buy this laptop because I wasn't sure how it would be but I love it. It's worked well for the past 2 months I've had it. It is very quick, especially when it boots up. The screen has an amazing display and there are no real issues with the product. The only downfall is that there is no CD/DVD player, and the keys aren't really backlit, but other than that it functions as it should!
I love this computer for the most part, speakers aren't that loud and the fan can be loud, but my mouse pad won't work properly sometimes and my HDMI port doesn't work. Sound through the headphone jack is low too. I found out about the HDMI port not working while I tried hooking up my computer for a class presentation. I'll probably have to send my computer in to get fixed and once the mouse pad and HDMI port gets fixed then I'll update this review to 5 stars. This is a great computer for the most part, I think I just got a lemon. I'm not rough with my computer at all and I've never dropped it either.
This laptop has a feel of very high quality. Also, the parts have good quality for the price. My wife uses it for studying, and leaves everything open. The memory in the laptop has been able to handle everything open, and the ssd drive makes the boot time quick. Another great feature is the battery life. It has a really long lasting battery. This is a good laptop for someone looking for a higher end model laptop for work.
This is a pretty solid laptop. I purchased it about a week ago and it has performed above/beyond my expectations. I switched to this laptop from a Toshiba Satellite, which had such a low processing power that it took an hour for chrome to open. This has an i7 processor which keeps its speeds crisp and quick. To make things easy, I will outline the pros:1. Fast, good processing2. Back-lit Keyboard3. Lightweight, Portable4. Excellent USB Port Access (3 of them)5. Crisp, Vibrant Screen Resolution6. Reasonable Battery Life for a laptop of this size, price rangeThere are a few cons though, but they aren't significant enough for me to lower my rating.1. No CD drive - but this is something I understand since most laptops are made without them nowadays.2. I noticed that removing/inserting anything USB-related is a bit cumbersome. The ports seem a bit too tight for accomadation3. Poor Webcam: the built-in webcam is grainy and is low quality.Thus far, everything else seems pretty good. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. We'll see how well this laptop works over the next few months to years. I will edit this review accordingly.
Great laptop for the price. It meet or exceeded all my expectations after reading many of the reviews on here and from other research online. My last laptop was an Asus that had held up very well and still performs pretty well, so I wanted to stay with a brand that I've been able to rely on. The fingerprint sensor makes logging in a breeze and it stays up from the scan nearly instantly. Occasionally there is a little lag but nothing to bad. This has everything I need for my usage and I'll probably never touch more than half the memory but it's nice to have such a large amount of storage just in case. I've been using it for about a month and a half and no issues have come up with it.
Bought this computer (about 3 months ago) because I wanted something mid range that was travel friendly and could handle basic gaming. I'm happy to say that this laptop meets all of those criteria. Super light weight and boots up fast. I can play league of legends for hours without any issue. Some points that may be helpful to some people: My computer crashed after playing games and having a video open in Chrome. From my experience the computer life is no where near what is advertised. It's more like 5-6 hours rather then 10. Also, a bit disappointed that it didn't come with a longer, more sturdy power cord with a ground. Just came with a standard two pronged power adapter. All that said though, I'm very happy with my purchase. Definitely a good buy if you're looking for something travel friendly, and something that can handle standard tasks plus a little more.
As an experienced Windows 10 user, this laptop was absolutely beyond my expectations after I purchased it. I've had it for almost 3 months and the performance is amazing. It's very fast even on slower internet speeds, and weighs very little with a very sleek design. I can store almost anything with the storage capabilities. I rated this laptop 5 stars because I couldn't imagine anything better. The only thing I would change if I could is the quality of the webcam. It's low pixel and not the best for video chatting. The speakers are okay with adequate bass. I've only had Dell laptops before but I will definitely be purchasing Asus again in the future.
A great laptop. The weight is a killer spec. Only 1.6 kilogram which is 1.5 times less then my previous 15" laptop. The screen is ok (better then my previous laptop but not as good as my desktop). SSD+HDD combo is good if you need both speed and storage. I initially thought that just SSD would be a better option so it would be a little bit lighter and spent less power (but would have less storage). Battery is disappointing a little bit (it is not a long lasting one. I initially thought it would be enough for a day, but it is actually for 3-5 hours of work).I like the keyboard and touchpad. As well as fingerprint which allows to log in quickly.Overall great product.
This is a great computer, be it a laptop or a vivo book. No matter what you call it it works. I love the metal body and the finish on it. It has all the things I wanted including ,i7, I have used Asus help/chat line several times and they have been great about walking me through any problem I was having.
This was purchase for my wife. She loves it. She is very impressed with the performance. The slim, light weight package is a plus.
This product is great, and I would highly recommend it.
Great Screen Size and not too Heavy, Thinner than most. Amazon Prime Delivery Delayed
I have had this laptop for a few days now and I love it! It is very fast. The only thing that I wish it had (and I knew this before purchasing) is a numeric keypad, so I have to use the number buttons on the top. The fingerprint scanner is also a very nice feature.
Lightweight and has solid state drive which makes it start up super fast. I also like that the keyboard design helps keep it clean, My previous laptop accumulated all sorts of stuff between the keys. However it is a bit too sensitive for me and any small touch is interpreted as a movement. Also the battery life does not 6 hours as stated.
Itâs so lightweight! Iâve had it for about two months. Donât love the mouse/trackpad at all, but thatâs easily solved by using a plug in.
Light, good size screen, fast, and reliable!
I bought this on impulse, I didn't intend to buy another laptop for at least two or three years.But after seeing my daughter with a computer that had an SSD, I will admit to jealousy.My old computer took about three minutes to start and was much slower than her's was and I guess that stuck in my thoughts.I was idly looking on here for another Asus that had an SSD and couldn't find one for my normal five hundred dollars and under price when I clicked on this and was like a schoolgirl with a crush.The processor, HD screen, SSD, plus another 1TB memory, I added it to my cart and bought it.I had regret for a few days until it came and I opened the box and saw it, I had been intending to return it but, instant puppy-love hit me again.Three people have asked to buy my older computer, but I have refused because I still feel an attachment for the old one.
Love this! I was hesitant on buying an Asus just because I've always been a Mac girl, but I'm very pleased with this so far.
Absolutely LOVE this laptop. Very lightweight.
Turns on quickly. Strong wireless connection. Very portable and light weight. Fast processing. Probably the best computer I've ever purchased.
Typing responsiveness is fast, log in time fast, overall performance fast. This company has taken laptop use to a whole new level. I use it for school and have no problem paring it via Bluetooth to any other device necessary.
I bought this for my son, a first year college student, and he is very pleased with the performance with this machine.
Awesome exactly what I expected best laptop ever....
Very happy with this computer! I bought it to replace an older ASUS which served me faithfully for eight years. Was time to replace it with another ASUS.
Love this computer! Great purchase for the money. It's quick and reliable. No complaints!
The keyboard failed within a month and a half. I tried communicating with Asus but they did not help. Amazon let me return it late but I only got a refund for 80%.
Love it. Received in good quality and with backlit keyboard. However the excel inside need to be re-installed for the account keeps showing unlicensed. The 15.6 inch screen looks great.
Great price, great features and a good looking laptop!!!
This computer DOES NOT WORK WITH ANY HEADSET/MIC. Per Tech Support, if it uses a headphone, it cannot also use a mic. RIDICULOUS! DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WILL EVER WANT TO USE A HEADSET/MIC!
Donât get me wrong: this laptop is light years ahead of any computer I have ever owned. It is slim, light, fast, great lookingâ?I really wanted one that had an SSD and hard drive so I could work quickly but store a lot of photographs and at work. But for streaming video it is terrible â?the sound is very quiet and very muffled. I donât want to have to get external speakers or wear headphones every time I want to watch a show. Havenât decided if Iâm going to return it but Iâm very disappointed.
I was the best choice! I am so happy with this purchase
CPU problem, fan overruns most of the time (even when simple websites in use) over %100, freezing and not responding to mouse pad. Returned for an another unit...
nice screen. like the touch pad.
Absolutely wonderful! works well and just what i needed.
Excelente producto, recomendable!
nice laptop...quick and responsive.
Fan was making noise.
Excelente pc
Very goodð
Amazing computer. Does everything I want it to. Speakers are crap and so is webcam
my laptop is shutting down 2-3 times in week showing errors always different i tried contact product support twice and nobody answered to me and when i contacted ASUS support service they told me what i need to do and on the end they told me that it has internal issue but seller or even product support is not reacting on my emails ...
Overall, the laptop works well while having an appealing design -- however, there are many different factors that will make you hate this computer. First, the graphics are terrible -- even with Intel integrated graphics, the computer cannot manage to perform tasks that are simple in terms of graphical demand. While the computer can run videos on YouTube, it cannot manage to run Netflix (I have 150mbps, so it is not due to my internet connection). The image usually appears extremely blurry, and there is nothing you can do to resolve this issue. Secondly, the speakers sound average at best, but the major issues are due to the speaker's location, which is directly under the computer -- you must have the computer on a straight, solid surface in order to hear the sound -- placing your laptop on your bed or carpet will make the sound very difficult to hear. Thirdly, the battery life is terrible -- if I'm doing the slightest amount of work on my computer, the battery is dead within 1-3 hours. Lastly, if you are into gaming, this computer fails in every category. Obviously, this computer is not designed to handle gaming, but playing games that are very basic, two dimensional, and primitive can barely run. On the plus side, this laptop will fulfill all of your basic needs (Word, PowerPoint, email, small projects, video chat).To reiterate, here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Lightweight- Attractive Design- Performs Small Application Very Well- Light-Up Keyboard- Easy-To-Type Keyboard- Can Handle Programming- Overall Reliable- Thin DesignCons:- Highly Overpriced- Fails To Run Many Applications- Bad Battery Life- Graphics Are Terrible And Replacing The Graphics Card Will Not Help Much (It Is The Computer Itself)- Cannot Be Used For Entertainment Purposes (Netflix, Gaming)
fastest PC out there
love it
Good build quality,light weight.Easy to carry around anywhere.Sleek design.Not the best audio quality,but is good for people who use it for office work.People using it for media purposes,its not the best option.
User observations on the ASUS VivoBook S:The Intel Core i7-7500U 2.7GHz processor lets me bring up applications far more quickly than on any computer I have had before.Even though the laptop frame size is what traditionally has house a 14â?monitor, the narrow bezel allows it to hold a 15.6â?monitor it seems larger.There is no wasted space and it uses almost the entire monitor, making for an impressively large picture.The picture is super crisp with very sharp images.The aesthetics are great. It is lighter and slimmer than previous laptops Iâve had and has an attractive brushed metal finish that really appeals to me.My only complaint is that the Delete key is right next to the Power button. This, according to Murphyâs Law means that the likelihood that you will accidentally shut the computer off will increase in direct proportion to the importance of the document you are working on. For this reason, I give this computer four stars. Aside from that, I loved it.
I bought this for my son when he started college this fall. He LOVES it. I got it 2 days after I ordered it. The screen is nice and big, it is extremely light weight, and it is just looks nice.
It's just ok. Battery is not that great and I am having extremely irritating issues with wi-fi. It continuously loses internet connection. The internet issue started about a month ago, a few months after I purchased this. It has trouble just finding a wi-fi to connect to and when it does it loses it. I have restarted in and shut it down, waited a while, and started back up and still internet issues. When you pay over $800 for a laptop you would expect it to work perfectly for at least a year especially since I don't do much on it
Love it!
It's a great device however I received it with a dent on the lid. Very disappointing.
Awesome. Only thing I donât like it that it has no numerical keyboard . You have to use upper keyboard numbers. But otherwise awesome! I have always had good result with ASUS. A+
I wish it had a number keypad on the right hand side.
Great full-featured Windows 10 laptop. it has pretty much any port you would want, including USB Type-C for future applications. I wish that it charged like my Asus Chromebook: with USB Type-C; but I would guess it's because it uses more power than the connection can supply. Right out of the box I had an application for it: I installed Kodi with my Plex Add-on, then connected it to my TV Via HDMI and I was running home movies via my Plex server in less than 20 minutes.Like with any OEM laptop, there is some bloatware to it. I uninstalled most of it. The year subscription to McAfee is a joke: go with Comodo if you want a quality security application.
Graphics are not good. Battery life? 8hrs? Lol non- existent, more like 8 minutes. Cannot even connect to Wi-Fi properly. My old hp amda8 series... with a broken screen lol is working better. I've only had the laptop a few hours and I completely regret the purchase. The only good thing is the exterior looks bomb.
This laptop has many excellent features. It is super light so you wonât get shoulder strain if you want to carry it around all day in a laptop bag. The laptop just looks nice, from the backlit keyboard to the clear bright screen. It starts up quickly. The specs are impressive and It has performed great so far with internet use, photo editing, word processing, and some Steam gaming. I donât think this would be the best system for a hardcore gaming machine, but itâs great for games that are not extremely system demanding. It has a good size hard drive which is a definite plus. Overall, an nice machine that should perform well for someone needing to do typical home computer work and light gaming.
I would try to be as neutral as I can because even after getting the defective device, I would do a full analysis. When I received the laptop, the first impression was amazing but I was only able to use it foe about 10minutes. After configuring the windows, when I put it on charging and came back after an hour, there was no power indication and when I tried to turn it on, nothing happened. It was just like a dead machine.I would say when I turned it on in first place, the display was eye-catching but the brightness is only 250 nits at maximum. A lot of people complained about the flex in keyboard, to be honest, it was not a big deal. Likewise, the backlit on keyboard was more than satisfactory.Verdict: Its a mid-level laptop from Asus. I would recommend everyone to save some more bucks and go for some high end device e.g. Xps 13 or 15, Hp Spectre, Lenovo X1 Carbon.
DOWNGRADED to 2 stars because of the supplied Operating System. Don't buy unless you're willing to format. The Win 10-Home that comes with it is USELESS. I'm losing many hours of work because the unmanageable updates are constantly breaking my programs. The audio pops all the time and the video on my HDMI began to spaz out after one of these unrequested updates.UPDATE: upgraded to Win 10 per ASUS support suggestion and it has solved NOTHING !! It's fast but all the quirks will drive you crazy. Go find a Toshiba or Lenovo.UPDATE: ASUS support completely clueless. Tells me to format. They have no real 2nd tier knowledge to solve problems. They just e-mail people telling them to format.
Se demorÃ³ en llegar la ASUS
I failed to see that this thing doesn't have an optical drive....
I paid over $1,500 for this Asus. Had it 15 months. It stopped working. I took it back to Best Buy to get it repaired. I was told it would cost more to have it repaired than to purchase a new one. To bad I paid cash.No recourse. Purchase an Asus at your own risk.
Bought this laptop to run Manjaro KDE (Linux) and act as my primary "everyday use" computer at home. Ill break the review down into 2 parts. Ill start first with the hardware which should be helpful to anyone reading this and then the second part will specifically be about using Linux on it. Model is Dell i5379-5893GRY-PUS (Dell Inspiron 13" 2-in-1 touchscreen)Hardware:The build quality is nice. Despite being a plastic shell (instead of metal like the Inspiron 7000) it feels of good quality to the point of questioning if it is plastic. The finish is nice and doesn't appear to attract finger prints as much as glossier finishes. Its a good balance of enough weight to not feel cheap but not too much that its "heavy" for its size.Specs:* Intel i5-8250U (8th gen i5 with 4c/8t @ 15watt TDP)* Intel UHD Graphics 620 (integrated graphics, no dedicated GPU)* 8GB DDR4 2400mhz RAM (I think 1x8GB, will have to verify)* 256GB SATA SSD (Samsung PM871 from what I can tell, seems to be 2.5" 7mm not m.2)* 13" 1920x1080 IPS touchscreen (glossy, but not terrible)* Webcam supports Windows HelloPorts:2x USB 3.1 type-A1x USB 2.0 type-A1x HDMI (listed as 1.4)1x SD card reader1x Headphone/mic combo jackThe monitor has, in my opinion, pretty large bezels. At first I was disappointed by this but considering its ability to take a tablet form, this likely was done to give something to hold onto in tablet mode without touching the screen by accident. Otherwise its sharp and bright with decent viewing angles.The rear of the base has a short, somewhat wide vent to exhaust hot air out and does have an active fan however at its loudest it was negligible. I would have to focus on trying to hear it to notice. The upside is it should allow longer boost times on the CPU before throttling sets in.I found it a bit strange at first that the power and volume rocker are on the right side towards the front of the machine, but have since gotten used to it and figure it is also likely purposeful due to being able to use it like a tablet.The hinge between the base and monitor is sturdy and feels like it should last if treated well. I dont notice any wobbling while typing on a hard flat surface. The keyboard is ok but not great. I like the look of it and the backlighting can be plenty bright but the feel leaves a bit to be desired. The key presses seem to allow for pressure un-evenly on a key allowing one side to press further than the others which gives the sense that its not that sturdy. I would expect for the press to evenly push the key down but on this keyboard its a bit "mushy". For what its worth it appears to be the exact same keyboard as the Inspiron 13" 7000 series. On the flip side, the touch pad is pretty nice and I typically hate touchpads. This one is pretty large and the buttons (bottom right and left of the touchpad itself) are clicky.It doesnt look like there are any bay doors on the bottom to access the SSD or RAM and the batter is a built in job, not easily replaceable (if at all). It is unclear if the laptop has the 8GB included soldered in or in 1 of 2 ram slots. Its also unclear, but I expect that there is an empty 2nd ram slot (as most documentation seems to indicate it can be upgraded to 16GB by the user, just not how). I would imagine this would require removing the 8 or so screws on the bottom and maybe even using a pry tool to unsnap some plastic fasteners are the edges.For the price I was unable to find a laptop with everything I was looking to compete with this. I wanted a 13" or smaller 1080 touchscreen with an 8th gen CPU, 250GB+ SSD, 8GB+ DDR4 RAM. This was the best deal I could find at the time including that ($709). There are tradeoffs with that. Some of what you dont get are:* USB type-c* Thunderbolt 3* NVMe PCIe SSD* Metal body* Higher resolution screenI would say this is a great machine for anyone who wants something small and portable with decent specs and that doesnt require a ton of storage or super demanding tasks (CAD, 3d rendering, advanced photoshop, extrmely large databases/spreadsheets, etc.) or gaming.Linux:I am now using Linux at work alot and learn best by giving myself a practical purpose to do something. I wanted to entrench myself in Linux at home while having something that was modern, aesthetically pleasing, functional, practical and portable.Prior to getting this laptop I tried about about 10+ distros and decided that; a) I liked KDE Plasma as a desktop environment best and b) I like Manjaro Linux as a distro the most.I didnt get this to do development type work from or anything like that. This is meant to be my "daily driver", its what I will use every day to browse the web, check email, work on documents, watch media, do some minor photo/video editing, occasionally run a VM, etc.I downloaded the 17.0.6 Manjaro KDE ISO and setup an USB3 drive to install from. Booted from the drive and ran installer which took about 5-10 mins which is on par or maybe slightly faster than I would expect for a Win 10 install using the same hardware/specs.Out of the box all of the drivers where recognized and working. Here are a couple things I was worried about and can confirm all working:* Qualcomm AC Wifi (will add model later, not handy right now).* Qualcomm Bluetooth* Touchscreen* Keyboard Backlight* Webcam (both standard and infrared lol)* GPU drivers for Intel* Screen Brightness* SoundI have not yet found any part of the hardware not working as intended.Battery life appears to land me at about 6+ hours of steady use so I am very happy with it.Software wise, most things just work. I have had to, as with any linux distro, troubleshoot and work out some kinks but nothing I can even recall as worth mentioning.At the end of the day, this is the first time I have felt like I really own the computer. KDE especially allows a level of customization I could only dream of in Windows. This is coming from someone who not only likes Windows 10, but previously worked for a company for 6 years with MS partnership in which we provided remote and on site support for many of their products including Windows and Office. I've developed professional course material and classes on Windows and taught the classes. I have defended Windows 10 fiercely at times. I have Windows Server 2016 Essentials at home and 3 other Windows 10 Pro computers on the domain with it.Why say all this about Windows? If someone like me can escape MS's strangle hold so can you. If you have considered moving to Linux this laptop is a great choice. However, dont take my word for it. Do your research, decide what distro and make sure it will work with whatever you install it on.EDIT (11/20/2017): So it appears the RAM and SSD can be upgraded. To do so requires removing the bottom of the laptop (roughly 8-10 screws and using a pry tool to unhinge the plastic tabs). Crucial shows upto 32GB (2x 16GB) RAM and guarantees compatibility. The SSD is a 2.5" SATA SSD 7mm height, so m.2 drives will NOT work and especially not PCIe/NVMe drives. I havent upgraded myself as I have no need to now.EDIT (01/02/2018): For anyone concerned with firmware/BIOS updates while using Linux I have done a Intel ME Firmware update and a BIOS update (1.3.2).For the Intel SA-00086 advisory and update Dell has a page listing all model affected with links to their updates (a link to it is posted on Intel's official page for the advisory). In this case I used a Windows to Go drive to boot to Windows 10 without altering the installed setup on my machine. I had to install drivers to Intels ME and reboot. I then ran the update from Windows to Go and then shutdown and booted back to Manjaro KDE to verify the results via the script Intel provides and it returned that the issue was patched. Be aware booting from Windows to Go wouldnt be needed if running Windows already.The BIOS is actually easier. You just put the BIOS update exe on a thumb drive and plug it in, boot and press F12 to get the boot menu, select BIOS update. Browse to the update file on the thumb drive and run the update. I havent seen any other firmware udpates related to the laptop but if there are others I will likely use a Windows to go drive to do so unless its specifically a BIOS update.**Upgraded machine!!!I have since purchase changed the wifi card and upgraded the RAM. I did this as the QCA6174 wifi card made by Qualcomm isnt exactly Linux friendly. It worked, but had 2 major issues. Slow SMB xfer and it would report wifi connecting at 6 MiB/s (incorrectly). I bought an Intel 8265 which is officially supported for use in Linux brand new for $20 and works perfectly.I figured while I had it open to add another stick of RAM so I bought an 8GB stick of crucial RAMÂ Crucial 8GB Single DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) DR x8 Unbuffered SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT8G4SFD824AÂ and it worked perfectly. To be honest the RAM upgrade wasnt even needed, but didnt want to break it open just to change the wifi card out. I considered an SSD upgrade as well, but I have like 200GB free of the 256GB so I am not exactly hurting for space.Also using this bluetooth mouseÂ Logitech MX Anywhere 2 Wireless Mobile Mouse, Long Range Wireless Mouse with Hyper Scroll and Easy-Switch up to 3 Devices - NavyÂ which plays very nicely connected via bluetooth. Latest stable Manjaro update even adds its battery status to the battery notification area! Really like this mouse.Would still highly recommend this laptop as I am sure it will serve me for years to come.
I like the laptop. Light wt, touch screen is excellent with good resolution, super quiet, SDD is amazing ( first time owning one). Fast enough with me running photoshop 2017. Overall good laptopCONS :- plastic build, could have been more sturdy- camera is ok ok. although tbh, no one really uses it these days- fan vent is located facing down, cant keep on the bed or on lap.
I'll be honest in saying I'm pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect to love this laptop as much as I did. After my tablet finally died I wanted something more versatile, and was thinking detachable keyboards would be the way to go. Saw this for the right price and decided to give it a shot. I'll never buy a 2-in-1 that can't swivel, ever. Can rotate it to any angle, adapts right away to tablet mode. It's a solid little powerhouse that can get a bit hot, but that's expected. Low storage isn't a huge issue. You can keep most things on another homegroup computer and keep the essentials local. Overall, great laptop for the price
Light, feels sturdy. great screen. Has been a wonderful laptop so far. I spent a little more to get the solid state drive instead of a traditional disk. Less storage, but as one reviewer pointed out much lighter.
I bought this to replace a Dell XPS 13 that died suddenly. While it doesn't have the fancy aluminum case, thin bezel and carbon fiber hand rest of the XPS, this Inspiron has a newer 8th generation processor, twice the SSD space, a touch screen and nice form flexibility. I got it all set up and have found that it has a good looking screen, reasonably fast performance for a laptop and I like the ability to use it as a laptop or as a tablet.The performance and strong features for a price point of just $650, make this a very attractive choice if you are looking for a laptop of this size.
I bought this laptop in December'17. My laptop started having issues a very few months after purchase (its still in warranty for quite some time). The laptop kept powering off and then not starting back-on (or no display) despite several tries and showed random behavior (i had to reset the OS too, losing all my data). Ultimately there came a time when the laptop shut off with no LEDs turning on and the laptop would not power-on no matter what. I had to FedEX ship my product to their Houston site after making a long customer delivery call. I got back my laptop in a week (with the motherboard replaced). However, ever since, it has battery issues (ie. the battery drops from 50%+ to 6% within a minute) making it impossible to work with the laptop unless connected to a power source. I have never seen a Dell laptop to have misbehaved so much, it really hinders all your work.
I absolutely love this product. It is light, and ideal for traveling with. Has a SSD with more than adequate storage for my needs, more than enough RAM, more than enough CPU speed/performance for everything I do. Battery life is ~ 7h. The network connectivity chip of this PC is a welcome change from my last PC (an HP which struggled with connecting to Wifi). This laptop immediately locks in to the nearest WiFi extender in my home - or any other WiFi I connect it to. LOVE the back-lit keyboard (my MUST-HAVE feature). Just the perfect PC for me. Very happy - No hesitation recommending this product.
Love this fast light weight computer. I use Corel draw on it and heavy duty embroidery software. Fast and easy
This is one great laptop. Amazing tech stuff, memory and all. No doubt about it. The touchscreen is pretty good and I can't see how it could be better. The resolution is perfect (especially for a 13" screen). I know some will complain about how the screen could fit more the size and stuff like that, but this is a 2in1 laptop. You're supposed to have somewhere to hold if you're in tablet mode. Keep that in mind. I think the only thing that could be better is the touchpad. After a few changes in windows options, I managed to find a pretty good balance, but it's not yet perfect.
Good tablet for a good price. With the new generation processors introducing cheap and affordable quad cores, the Tablets of 2018 are much stronger than 2017.
I like this laptop a lot. Only problem is it gets a tiny bit louder when its charging but its not crazy loud, definitely bearable. Windows 10 is a little crazy sometimes but as a whole I'm very happy with this product.
Be careful if you purchase this. I tried to upgrade the OS from Windows 10 Home to Pro. I spent the extra $135 on the upgrade but no matter what I did it wouldn't work.
I love it! I can take it anywhere & switch into tablet. Itâs light so I can carry around.
Very good laptop. There are a lot more better laptops out there, but this was the best for quality/price. I'm happy with this purchase.
so far, I love it
Received the computer very quickly and it has been as expected so far. That said, it came with absolutely zero paperwork of any kind. Literally nothing. No confirmation of any software that the software installed is legitimate. Contacted Amazon support and they confirmed it was a new machine purchased from Dell by Amazon and sold to me - but unfortunately they had no proof of licensure that could be provided. First time I have purchased a computer using Amazon and I intentionally bought from Amazon directly. Hard to believe this was the answer but it is what it is I guess. Buyer beware when purchasing from Amazon I guess is the answer.
The keys on the keyboard were mixed up
I received this device and installed all the updates and everything properly. Now it restarts randomly stating that windows did not load correctlyl. I inspected the UEFI and it states that there is an HDD installed where there should be a SSD. This greatly Upsets Me.
Product delivered with no damage on packaging. Screen display faulty upon power up. Sending it back right away.
Just what we wanted
BACKGROUNDIâm not that old but I got interested in computers early on. I was the first of my friends who owned a personal computer and one of the first owners of what could truly be called a laptop. Back then the name Dell conjured up an image of something kluged together in someoneâs dorm room and it was years before I could take them seriously.Fast forward to today when Iâve owned so many PCâs Iâve lost count and my personal laptop is a large-screen Dell gaming machine that may be the most advanced laptop Iâve ever owned. Needless to say these days I have no issues when I hear someone say dude youâre getting a Dell.This one is at the edge of modern technology and thankfully for me has what it takes to use in my business in a much smaller and lighter form factor than my big Dell gaming laptop and as a bonus adds a touch screen, which to me is more than just a trivial nicety, as a graphic artist and pro photographer when combined with a PN338M active pen they are big selling points.OBSERVATIONSItâs true that Dell laptops may not be carved from a single piece of aluminum and there is extensive use of plastics, but it all comes together to form a surprisingly well built and sturdy machine. The keys feel tight and accurate, the track pad that tends to be misunderstood if you donât read how to customize it is better than average, and the 13.3â?screen the ideal compromise between being big enough to be useful but small enough to keep the device small and portable - the entire laptop is not much larger than a sheet of paper and just over 3/4 inch thick.This laptop is the most lacking of status lights, switches or buttons Iâve ever seen. There is literally only one status light at the front edge that illuminates during charging or when the storage drive is accessing. The on/off switch is on the exterior side and is a push to activate button, which unfortunately could be pushed accidentally, especially if you store it in a soft laptop case. The only other button is an external rocker switch for the volume control. In terms of I/O ports my opinion is that what they have is adequate but not impressive but for me itâs all I need.SPECSAs far as specs, they speak for themselves, it runs my most intensive photo/video editing apps without hesitation (note that the stock 8GB RAM is easily user upgradable, which I upgraded to 16GB myself in a couple of minutes).DOWNSIDESOne thing is that at 3.5 pounds itâs not the lightest but I can forgive that because it does feel more rugged than some if the lighter models. Another is the lack of an optical drive which is simply a fact of life today and other than being a minor inconvenience for people like me who do graphics work Iâd gladly give up the extra weight and use of space an internal optical drive would add.An observation that I wouldnât exactly call a downside but definitely distorted is that they say it has a âsleek new design that emphasizes more screen and less bezelâ? No thatâs not true, what theyâve done is extend the glass that covers the screen all the way to the edge purely for cosmetics but under that glass is a totally normal 13.3â?screen surrounded by large borders and a very thick border at the bottom. They had plenty of real estate to actually reduce the size of the bezel and use a larger screen â?but they chose not to.Speaking of design, the entire design philosophy of this laptop is that it can be used in multiple configurations. That sounds really nice on paper but in real life use it turns out to be not all sunshine and rainbows. When used as a typical laptop (on your lap) the two audio speakers are on the bottom and face right into your lap, muffling the sound. Even when on a desktop the sound is muffled. And the fan, the value of which is questionable since my much larger Dell laptop doesnât have one, and the one in this unit is weak, also faces downward into your lap. When you prop it up like an easel the keyboard faces downward on the desktop, supported by only four tiny rubber feet. The feet are all toward the top of the keyboard so if you press too hard when using the touchscreen the entire laptop rocks backward. When you use the laptop in a tent mode, there are no plastic or rubber feet along the edge that sits on the desktop (the front edge that faces you when used as a normal laptop). This doesnât cause any major problems except that that painted plastic edge is subject to a lot of wear and tear and eventually looks really bad. And finally, if you want to use it as a tablet, well letâs just say it is awkward because any or all of your fingers that are holding on to the back of the unit are pressing against the keyboard, which is not a good thing for obvious reasons.I canât help but mention one particular flaw that it seems they could have done something about which is that their own preloaded update app isnât smart enough to know when Windows is in the process of doing an update (which is pretty often). This is especially true when your unit is brand new and the first thing Windows does is brings it up to date with endless updates that can last for hours. Unfortunately Dellâs update app doesnât respect that and barges in trying to do their own updates at the same time, the worst of which was just as Windows was finishing a major version update, they decided to flash the BIOS without asking me (which is a sensitive and major task during which absolutely nothing else should be running). This caused Windows to roll back and undo everything it took almost an hour to do. Iâm lucky that the BIOS update didnât fail and brick the entire computer. For them to permit such a conflict in software design is inexcusable.NITTY GRITTYI donât take sides when it comes to the PC vs Mac debate. I own both plus an iPad, and I use them daily. Both can be equally adept for people who work in the graphic arts with a lot of it boiling down to personal style and work habits. With all that in mind I have certain editing specialty apps that I want to use that are PC only and I have yet to finds a PC equivalent to my iPad Pro that lets me do pen based editing on a touch screen. This computer is that bridge for me and has enough power and resolution (not the best but good enough) that I decided to load it up with all of my photo and graphic apps and dedicate it as my personal workstation.SUMMARYIts biggest downside is how much it costs, it would be a strong contender at under 500 bucks but there are too many better options above the 700 buck mark that make you wonder what they were thinking listing it so high. One impressive plus is that this model has wonderfully easy and well documented accessibility for upgrading memory, storage, battery and just about everything else, something the pretty, trendy (and expensive) models from some other brands have as a strike against them.The unit Iâm I just got in early 2018 was made in late 2017 and is identified as a unit intended for Ireland and some of the user forums imply that it has already been discontinued. Itâs been difficult to verify that from the manuf because it is difficult to pin down exactly what the details are for any specific model from their info.If some of this sounds like I donât like it, thatâs not the case, it may not be as cutting edge as the price would suggest but the conservative design of Dell laptops has served me well previously and I have positive vibes that this one will as well. Sure this laptop rides at the upper end of the budget considering its specs but I think you get what you pay for, and dressed in that unique Theoretical Gray color it has the look of success written all over it.
I didnât like anything because it is224 gb but I ordered and paid price for 256 gb. Itâs battery doesnât run 2 hours also. I m cheated. I have starred just to submit.
This laptop didn't have many reviews, but I took a chance because I believed Dell to be of good quality based on reputation. Everything about it sounded great. Nice size, weight, resolution, battery life, number of ports, etc. All fantastic on paper.Then it arrived.I was excited to have a 2-in-1, so I immediately started using it in tablet mode, and I was greatly enjoying it. It all seemed like it was going to be fantastic. But then I decided to start testing it out in laptop mode and doing some browsing and reading, and let me tell you that this has the worst touch pad I have ever had the displeasure of using. Ever.If you are familiar with modern laptops, then you know the usual features. You use two fingers together and run them up and down to scroll. You spread two fingers away from each other to zoom out and pinch them together to zoom in. When these features work independently of each other, it all works great.However, that is not so with this piece of trash.The problem is that the touch pad is incapable of consistently differentiating between the two touches. For instance, imagine that you want to read a PDF at 100% zoom. You would imagine that that you could simply run your index and middle fingertips vertically across the touch pad, and then everything will scroll accordingly while maintaining 100% zoom. Not with this laptop. It constantly ends up thinking that the movement of your two fingers is a command to zoom, rather than a command to scroll. No matter how close I keep my two fingertips together, it inevitably ends up mixing in a zoom in/out command when all I want to do is scroll up/down. It doesn't matter how much or in what way I adjust the sensitivity -- it keeps on zooming when I am just trying to scroll.If you are in tablet mode, it's great. If you are using an external mouse, it's great. But if you want to use the touch pad, then forget about it. This is a completely useless product due to the laziness and lack of quality control that went into programming the touch pad. In 2018, this is absolutely unacceptable.How can the designers of this product have the gall to sell it with this atrocious touch pad? Are you people really so shameless?Dell has really fallen off the wagon, and I will never buy another Dell product ever again, nor will I ever recommend Dell to anyone ever again. Thanks for wasting my time, Dell.
I have been using this computer for a few weeks now and I am happy with it so far. Everything I tested has worked flawlessly.Intel i5-8250U processorIt is a mid-range processor, quite adequate for most home uses including picture and video editing. Don't just assume that i7 is more powerful than i5 because many i7 processors are much inferior compared to this i5 processor. Always compare the processor performance benchmark numbers on PassMark CPU Benchmark site before concluding one way or the other. According to PassMark numbers, this i5-8250U CPU is not bad at all.8GB memoryWhile 4GB is enough for most home uses like browsing, email, word processing, spreadsheets, etc., 8GB is preferred if you plan to do occasional photo editing and normal video editing (using, say, Microsoft MovieMaker). Any serious video editing may require more memory.256GB SSDWhile solid state drives offer you much better performance for read/write operations, they also come with a smaller capacity. It will help with quick boot up and wake from sleep or hibernation. Also, it will help with quick shutdown, sleep, and hibernation. Obviously, copying pictures and videos from your camera/camcorder/phone will be very fast too. However, a regular hard drive for a similarly priced laptop would have been 1TB or larger. Personally, I don't need a larger drive because I regularly take double backups and delete from the computer.ScreenBeautiful and sharp screen. I am very satisfied.Built-in speakersI am not impressed by the speakers. They are on the bottom surface of the keyboard and don't produce good sound. Expect to use headphones or external speakers. I would recommend external wireless blue tooth speakers.Blue toothWorks well. Sound quality depends on your headset or speakers.Touch padI didn't have any problems with the touch pad. I could easily perform all gestures supported by Windows 10 and the system performed well.WirelessWorked well as expected and didn't notice any problems.Touch screenWorked well as expected and didn't notice any problem. I tested with Windows Paint 3D app and everything worked just as you would expect.Weight and sizeVery comfortable in all respects. Thin, light, and easily portable.Power adapterI like the fact that the brick is small and easily portable in a bag.Other/miscellaneousPower button is a little too small and hard to operate.Camera works fine. Windows 10 face recognition (for logging into the system) works very well and extremely convenient.Fully articulated hinge allows this computer to be placed like a tent or make it a tabletI wish it came with a display port, but only HDMI is offered2 USB 3.0 ports and 1 USB 2.0 port are available. I wonder why not all USB 3.0 ports.
I am so excited with this laptop. It is a medium to high end Intel laptop that comes with Windows 10. I have used Dell equipment in the past and in my opinion, they are not sexy as some others, but were work horse that are solid and reliable. My main computer now is a Mac (yes I am in the Apple orbit), so often times I compared other computers to Apple standard. This is one of the rare times I am excited about a laptop that was not from Apple.To start with, the screen is gorgeous. High resolution (1920x1080) and deep color, this makes everything beautiful from reading a magazine to watch movie a wonderful experience. Intel I5 and 256GB SSD help make the computer really fast. 8GB is so so, I wish I have more but for now, it seems sufficient. The whole computer is a bit heavier and bulkier than some other in the same class, but I believe there is a good reason for that: Touch Screen!It took a little bit to get used to, and I do worry that I will get used to this and start touching other laptop's screen! Think of a giant tablet with a keyboard attached. The screen is very responsive, browser windows closes or navigate nicely, just a light touch. I worried for a minute that my finger is too big for the screen, but that was not the case. The screen navigate just like an iPad, awesome! Of course, if you don't want to use the touch screen, the keyboard and touch pad let you operate like a regular laptop. Indefinite viewing position too.The laptop comes generously with 3 USB and a HDMI port, so you can actually hook to your TV and make it a media center. One thing that is different (and it took me a minute to figure out): the power on button is on the bottom right side instead of keyboard side.Over all, I am excited about this laptop and have used it regularly. My MacBook Pro is kind of gathering dust right now.
Got this on sale for $650 at my local microcenter. Was looking for expandable ram and quad core i5, this happened to be the heapest option for what i was looking for. Its a great machine, fast and smooth, havent had any issues so far. Its light and easy to carry, Its made of plastic with a 1080 display, the screen has some good viewing angles.The ram is supposed to be easily expandable(pull off the back and you can plug in your card) comes with two slots, one for the 8gb and a free upgrade slot.One of the biggest reasons i like this is the facial detection feature built in. Just turn on your laptop and look at the screen and your in. No messing with passwords or fingerprint sensor, its really fast like the password isnt even there.Only concern is the fan kicking in and machine getting pretty warm (79c), hoefully it doesnt become too much of a problem, but ive had this machine for a few weeks now and has only heated up twice. This is my first dell machine and its actually been one of the better laptops ive used. I would recommend buying this.
In many ways I really like this computer, but the terrible battery life and other issues bump it down to a three star product.So what do I love about it? It's super light, set-up was a snap, screen resolution is great, the flip function (tablet mode) works overall very well with the hinge being easy to maneuver, but tight enough to hold the angle you want. The touch screen works well, the keyboard feels great. I am not a huge windows fan, but I can't bump down the rating due to that.Now here are the things that I don't love: The speakers are on the underside of the computer. To me, this makes the audio sound a little odd, especially when it's in tablet mode. When in tablet mode, the main volume control is on the back flip, so that can be a little awkward. I also don't love that the power switch is right next to the volume control switch. I know they tend to be placed next to each other, and I really don't understand why since you will undoubtedly accidentally hit the power when aiming for the volume. Another weird design issue is when you put it in tablet mode the "DELL" logo is upside-down. I don't care that it's upside-down, but it was just a funny design flaw that we noticed. Most importantly, the battery life is bad, especially if you are watching videos. It does charge pretty fast though, but I often find myself having to plug it in to watch a video. Another thing I noticed is that it can get very hot, which I recognized when it was in laptop mode and it was sitting on my lap. It has gotten so hot that it was quite uncomfortable and I had to move it off or lift it up for a while. When it does heat up, the fan will turn on, and it's pretty loud. The fan also turns on way more than any other computer I've ever had. It mostly seems to turn on when watching videos.To recap, I love the flip function, touch screen and how lightweight it is. I don't love the terrible battery life, some bad design issues and tendency to run hot.
I have been using this laptop for the past few weeks and have nothing but great things to say about it!! For the past several years, I have been using an iMAC desktop, but there were times I wished I had a laptop, so I wouldn't be tied to my desk.The Dell Inspiron has been great. The laptop is very thin and lightweight. Very sleek looking and easy to throw in a carry all bag or computer sleeve and run out the door. Set up was very easy and took about 20 minutes. Following the prompts made it basically effortless to get up and running. One of the features that is new, is the facial recognition to sign in. User looks into the screen and the computer picks up on features to sign them in. You can also have a backup passcode to enter if your face is not recognized. This is nice if you are the main user but have someone else in the household that would occasionally use the laptop.The battery life has been good. It has been disconnected for about 4-5 hours, laptop was connected to wireless internet and Microsoft running and still the laptop had battery to give before it was plugged back in. The bottom of the computer did get pretty warm on my lap while I was resting it there work on it. I eventually moved the la top to the coffee table because of the heat. Once connected back to the power source, the battery charges very quickly. It was back up to 100% power in no time. That is great if your run your battery low and don't have time to sit and wait for a recharge.Some of the features that took some time to get a hang of, but I ended up loving, were the touchpad and the touchscreen. The touchpad is very sensitive. While typing if you hover close enough to the touch pad it will move the mouse and change your screen. For the first few days that was very frustrating, but once I figured out how to adjust my hands to stay off the pad, it has not happened very much, if at all. The sensitive touch pad is actually something I like now that that I have learned how to control and navigate with it. I can quickly jump from screen to screen or to text within a document.The other new addition to the laptop that I have not had previously is the touchscreen option. That is great!! Having the ability to move around on the screen by touching the actual screen is outstanding. You can use the touchscreen feature while in laptop mode or flip the screen over and have in tablet mode. It takes virtually 1 second to transition the laptop to a tablet.For having a laptop that is for personal use, mostly email, online, and Microsoft office this laptop is perfect. It is fast, lightweight and easy to use. There are so many features that we haven't even touched on yet but I can't imagine that I won't also like those once I get to needing them. I am by no means a computer person or guru but I have been working on a computer for many years and this is by far one of the best laptops I have used!!Very happy with this product and recommend it highly.
This review covers the i5379 etc. etc. since Amazon seems to lump reviews for different models together. Dell's unfortunate naming schemes don't help either.In case you hadn't noticed, notebook computers have gone off the deep end lately, trying to prove they're all sorts of things they're not, like tablets, or the ridiculous "tented" device you see in the product image. We get it, nearly every laptop has hinges that are fully articulated now. It's neither novel nor particularly useful most of the time. Let's get on with it.As a laptop, this is pretty decent. It has slim, "ultrabook" dimensions, although I think a proper ultrabook is at least somewhat metal/magnesium alloy in construction rather than plain plastic. The build quality of this laptop is fair, but nothing more. It feels a lot better than a $300 device, but is well behind a $1000+ device. For what Dell is asking I believe they could have tried a little harder on this front. However, it feels solid, has a nice screen, and the keyboard is tolerable. It's a decent lower-mid-range notebook. I don't like the massive bezel along the bottom of the screen (it's the one you see the upside-down "Dell" logo on the top of the tented version), and wish the screen format was just a little taller to actually use that real estate. The screen is otherwise quite good, though, and the touch screen is very responsive.A lot of the cost comes from the inclusion of the newest 8th-gen Core i5 processor. I have found it to be a pretty capable mobile processor, which handled my photo editing software well enough (although the 13" screen is too small for proper editing, it works in a pinch) and is fast and smooth for loading lots of browser tabs, streaming video and other notebook things. It's not a gaming rig, of course. I do find the fresh and up-to-date Windows 10 OS boots exceptionally quickly and is responsive and easy to use.Overall this device is a curious mix of old and new. It's a mid-range Dell notebook, and as such is made with some sub-par materials and build quality. that's the old. The new is that, unfortunately, it tries to be hip by (literally) standing on its head. It's a fast and light notebook that will handle most of what you throw at it, but please for the love of all that's good, don't flip it upside down and stare that that upside-down Dell logo while you're streaming Netflix. It's a laptop, people.
Update (5/22/18): the keyboard stops working mid game and I have to restart the computer, the computer is overheating (it got up to 152 degrees Fahrenheit), and the speakers aren't great. I called Asus and they said to send this one back. I ordered from a 3rd party seller so I may try directly from Amazon and get a cooling pad.First, I am a World of Warcraft gamer. I did a good amount of research on laptops. I am coming from a Lenovo Y700 15-ACZ. I chose this laptop because a) it was recommended by my gamer friends to get an Asus b) the larger SSD is good for the OS and the game since they are both large files. I also wanted the speed from the SSD c) sacrificed on the 1060 graphics but the 1050 is much higher than what I have now and looks great d) the keyboard is awesome!!! No more boring red keys. I checked this out at a best buy store before I purchased.Update after 2 weeks of use: Graphics are beautiful on the 1050 (I do not regret not spending the extra $$ for 1060 graphics). Loading screens are so fast and the game refreshes so much faster!! Trackpad is better (although I use a mouse). Took getting used to the font on the keyboard but that took just a couple of days. Big upgrade from my Lenovo. I did experience my keyboard/mouse locking up for a few seconds in WoW during a mythic+ but I think this had to do with the overlay from Discord or having to update the driver (went to geforce's website-- here you can download their program and optimize based on your game). The battery isn't the greatest but I don't mind since I play near an outlet and I'm not sure how much battery someone could expect out of a gaming laptop anyway. Yes the laptop gets loud at times but that is because it is using the fan so it does not give out! I am happy with my multi purple backlit keys :)
I bought this notebook while my daughter was in USA. Since I live in Brazil, she brought it to me 2 weeks ago. I'm not a gamer, I'm a software developer, so I need a fast machine to do my daily work, and gamers notebooks usually fits this requirement. I was an ASUS fan back in the 90's, when I used to assembly desktop machines with parts from different brands. ASUS was my preferred brand for the motherboards in that time, so I supposed that ASUS notebooks would provide the same quality that I was used to, back in those days. Well, it seems that my expectations was too high. The machine is fast, of course, but I faced two problems that I would like to share: When you "click" in the touchpad, it is like there is something loose inside that hits the plastic chassis mostly where you stand your wrist, causing an weird sensation. The other problem is a "high frequency" noise coming from the notebook when the CPU is under some load. I searched the online forums, and this sound seems to be pretty common in ASUS notebooks, and they call it "coil whine" sound. It seems to be harmless, but very annoying. The loose touchpad also seems to be common for those notebooks. Unfortunately, ASUS warranty does not cover Brazil, so seems that I'll have to live with those problems. They are not showstoppers, but they should not exist at all in a quality product. Another problem was regarding the (mostly useless) ASUS support. I replaced the original SSD with a (higher capacity) Samsung EVO 970, meaning that I had to do a fresh install of Windows 10. I downloaded all the drivers from ASUS site, but I wasn't able to install the touchpad driver. In the end of the install, it always raised an error. I contacted ASUS support by chat, and they gave me all kind of useless answers, like installing ASUS live, send it to RMA (in my case, this would not be possible), etc. I was sure that there was no hardware problem, since the touchpad worked fine in the bios setup screen, and also worked fine in the pre-installed Windows on the original SSD. It took me more than a day digging into forums, etc until I finally found that I had to install the Intel I/O driver before installing the Precision touchpad driver. This wasn't mentioned anywhere. This solved the problem, but I wonder how ASUS support missed this information! So, I wonder if buying an ASUS notebook was the best choice...
Great laptop, very competent for gaming and casual use. Love the 256GB SSD + 1TB combo - startup is super fast. Passmark score of 4123 puts this in the 83rd percentile. The 16GB appears to be in a single slot, leaving room to expand (though not sure you would need more than 16GB). Outside - the laptop is not overly gamey. The lid has the ROG decal in silver - no screaming red logos on this one. the overall slim profile keeps it discrete. There are 5 USB ports, one USB-C, and a video port along with a LAN port.Keyboard is nice, with keys to directly control volume and quick launch the ROG Gaming Center app. The ROG Gaming Center is interesting. It allows you to setup upto 3 game profiles.Profiles allow you to configure the fan and display settings, as well as kill any extra running processes (antivirus etc.), so that you free up more memory for the game. You can apparently control the Game Center via an android app on a phone, but did not try that. Keyboard has RGB backlights, that you can control with ROG Aura. Some basic options are available. I have seen some laptops that can change keyboard color based on CPU temps etc., that did not seem possible with this, but did not fully explore.Battery life is okay. Its a HQ processor, not known for power efficiency. You get about 2.5 hours without gaming. Running games and putting the fan in overboost mode will bring this down.The only area that is a little irritating with this laptop is the installed bloatware. Things keep popping up trying to make you buy stuff, create accounts, upsell, etc. If you find those apps useful, you might not mind it. I found them irritating. I am especially not crazy about how intrusive McAfee can be.
Have had this laptop for 1 day, I really like it. A 1-day review is usually frowned upon but Im going from a high end pc (1080 ti, 7th gen i7, etc) to this for work related reason and this thing is really impressive for a laptop. Its geared toward moba's but offers more than just that with the 1050 ti built in, and the 6 core i7 8th gen is a really great aspect. I can have a lot going on with a very slight lag that doesnt bother me (unclocked).I havnt played any games yet that are graphic intensive but my geforce program auto set a lot of my really nice games that are mostly about the scenario to mostly high settings with some being really high/ultra. Everything about the laptop feels nice. Im glad I bought it.
This order was a Christmas present for my daughter. This item was the only thing on her Christmas list, literally. I was very impressed that I ordered it on Thursday morning and it was here the very next morning! She is thrilled with this machine! She loves to game with her friends and she has been raving about this computer since she opened it on Christmas morning! I don't know if it is allowed, but perhaps she can write an in depth review of the product itself, rather than the transaction?
Had for a few months now and it's been a great gaming laptop! Get a cooling pad though, this sucker can get pretty hot.
This laptop is great so far.The lid seems less sturdy than the bottom half of the chassis.I have been very gentle with it but I worry that I will accidentally pull on the lid too hardwhile trying to open it one of these days.I've only had this product for a month but I will update the review if anything notable should happen.
<UPDATE>Changing the rating from 3 STARS to 2 STARS due to bad hardware compatibility.I found the cause of the hiccups and inconsistent frame rates as originally stated below. The combination of this Intel Chipset and Nvidia Chipset has reported issues almost like its a bug they can't fix. The 1050 isn't powerful enough to do most of the processing, so the i7 will enter (turbo mode) while your gaming to accommodate the lack of processing power. When this happens, your FPS will drop to a constant 30FPS. Once the switch to turbo is done, your frames will go back to normal. "Usually took about 30 seconds. and would happen about every minute or so."HOWEVER: If your game is new enough to where it enters turbo boost and stays in turbo boost - you wont have a problem. So this will only effect older/dated games. or if you have your laptop in performance mode and put the graphics all the way down for highest possible frames"</UPDATE>WARNING: If you are purchasing this laptop for gaming, be prepared to play all your games on the absolute lowest settings. Also, I received a laptop with bad speakers (uploaded video)I purchased this laptop thinking it was going to be an upgrade from my previous computer. Sadly that was not the case.My previous computer:i5-3750k8GB GSkill RAMGeforce 960 GTX4TB WD HDD240fps CSGO (with tweaked config)200fps Rocket League180fps Quake Champions85fps GTA V96fps PUBGRan flawlessly with no hiccupsThis laptop:180fps CSGO (with same config)150fps Rocket League75fps Quake Champions60fps GTA V50fps PUBGLots of hiccups and was very inconsistent and choppy.The i7 is not ideal for gaming, but performs well for multitasking programs.There was a lot of bloatware I had to remove in order to gain any type of performance boost.If you dont know how to turn off windows 10 xbox stream, on battery CPU power management, and nvidia laptop battery saver settings, your games are going to run at a solid 30fps or 60fps no matter what.This laptop is not a good gaming laptop for the price. I've had better gaming performance with a $700 Dell i5 Inspiron Laptop.
Well I decided to upgrade from my 650$ Dell Inspiron and am starting to regret it. Other than the 120hz screen, there is not a noticeable difference in performance. On top of that, There is a very annoying buzzing sound like one you'd hear during an AOL connection or something . I couldn't tell you where its coming from but I know its not the fans. All in all, If you're going to spend this much money on a laptop, don't spend it on this one.
I was looking for a computer with the juice to handle my data science demands and I found it in this gaming beast. The only gaming I'm doing in is tearing up data. It's beautiful too and the programmable lit keyboard is an awesome touch. So far it has exceeded my expectations.
The machine runs games great! Only thing is it came with a malfunctioning keyboard which really made me disappointed.
I just got the laptop today and have finally customized and installed everything I need on it (aside from all the games I want). I am a Computer Science major and avid PC game player so this laptop will be perfect for me. The laptop I had before this one was another ASUS ROG, I believe it was the GL551JM. It had Intel i7, GeForce GTX 960m, 1TB HDD, and 256GB SSD. So really the only upgrade I went for with a new laptop was the new processor, graphics card, and overall design. So far I love this design of the laptop, it feels very sturdy and comfortable and honestly it is quite sexy and slim. I was so happy when I took it out of the box. Another reason I upgraded laptops was because I had my previous one for about 3 years and the motherboard was giving out, the display wouldn't always turn on so I had to power on and off the laptop until it did. Occasionally the screen would have a glitch of pink lines coming up from the bottom of the screen. So it was in due time of getting a new laptop. I do hope this one will last longer than my last one, I will be sure to take extra care of this one too. It doesn't help that I commute back and forth from school with the laptop but this new one is slimmer and lighter than the last.
In 2018, GTX 1050 is little not buy-worthy but for this budget, this is the best. Thin and awesome design. Fans are little loud when the gpu at max.Played far cry 5 High quality (not ultra) without a single problem except the fans are louder than expected. That is not a big problem if you use a headphone
I had bad experience with rog; the audio speakers were breaking when i raise the volume above 15%, I tried installing all the audio drivers but no luck. key board is not workings some times in the middle of the game, i had to restart every time it got stuck and over heating for just playing one game... its bad. I read lot of good reviews about asus rog but I had bad experience
It's handles many popular games such as Overwatch, Pubg, and Rainbow Six Siege really well( However on High/Ultra, it runs loud and hot.) and boots up almost everything really quickly. And the display is really nice, i can put it in a vast amount of different angles without any glares. Overall, very happy with my purchase
This is a great MOBA laptop. It has just the right specs. The 1050TI is a perfect fit for MOBA Gaming. I like how the QWER keys are highlighted on the "Hero" edition unlinke the usual WASD. The 120hz is nicely done. This is a keeper. DOTA2 and Heroes Of The Storm HotS.
Perfect except than sometimes the keyboard stop function and I have to close the lid a few second to this function again
Been using it for 1 month now. Pretty much for gaming and work (container-managed software dev, etc).From a gamer's perspective:Pro:- sharp display- 120hz refresh rate- smooth keyboard- fast CPU & GPUCons:- as expected - gets hot - a little too hot sometimes (depending on the game, I guess)- touchpad could be a little betterSuggestions - it would be great if the screen opened out to: 180 deg
I just got mine yesterday, so far its been working great. I played a few games and they were smooth no stutters or anything. (Gta5) The screen is very very good very clear and colour accurate.
I am using this for college it has been great so far.
The laptop had good specs, but my laptop arrived damaged (Amazon sent me a bad item), I have had many troubles with this product, it does not work very well and others, I am not satisfied with this purchase. The item is very good.
Update May 2018: The laptop is pretty solid minus the failing drive mine shipped with. There was a mix up when the early review model was shipped to me so I received the wrong storage option. Asus support never responded to me despite multiple attempts to contact.TL;DR.. if you avoid the Single 1TB Hybrid Drive option, and utilize Amazon's return policy instead of ASUS support, it is a pretty solid gaming laptop. I swapped out the 1 TB Hybrid drive and problems went away. It is a very quick laptop with great graphic and CPU performance for the price.-----Things are not starting out well with this laptop. This is a new laptop so I do want to give ASUS a chance to address this. I will update this review as things develop.First of all, I was shipped the single 1TB spinning disk option (with the 8GB SSD cache built in, a.k.a the Seagate FireCuda 1TB), not the 256 SSD + 1TB HDD option I was supposed to review.I went to install some familiar games to run some benchmarks. I go away for a couple hours while the downloads run and come back to the machine crawling very slowly. I'm wondering why the download is going so slow and windows seems very sluggish, so I open up the task manager and find the hard drive is working really hard to keep up with a 2.5MB/second download. This is not at all normal behavior. I've attached a screen shot.I download Seagate's SeaTools utility and read the hard drive's diagnostic counters (SMART stats). SMART comes back clean (surprisingly), but the thing fails to complete even the short self-test, which clearly shows a failing drive. Another screenshot of that. A reboot changed nothing.Updated: Three contacts with ASUS support so far without any resolution.
I bought this computer and it did not come with a charger.Does this purchase come with a charger or not?
Touchpad is very bad. It have a sound when i touch and press on it.I hate the fan. It is very lound.
Best laptop I have ever had.
One of the best
Noise, Noise, Noise, Noise! I wasted my money for Buzz Noise and Fan Noise!
So far so good.
A workhorse laptop with a large, HD screen, 16GB memory, quad cores, backlit keyboard, and large hard drive makes for a solid gaming or development platform â?even better, this ASUS ROG STRIX Thin and Light Gaming Laptop is also (relatively) lightweight! Letâs take a closer look.Here are the basic specs, and be sure to also see the included pics:* 16GB RAM* 15.6â?full HD screen (1920 x 1080 pixels)* Storage: 256GB SATA SSD and 1TB HDD drives* Dimensions:15.1 x 10.3 x 0.9 inches, and weighing in around 5.6 pounds* CPU: 7th-generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core 2.8GHz (Turbo to 3.8GHz) with discrete GeForce GTX 1050 4GB graphics* I/O: Bluetooth 4.1, 3x USB 3.0, 1x USB 3.1 (Type C), 1x USB 2.0, 1x HDMI, 1x Mini DisplayPort, 1x headphone/Mic jack, and 1x RJ45 LAN port, and 802.11ac 2Ã2 WiFi* Keyboard: Aura RGB lighting keyboard with 4 isolated hotkeys, 1.6mm key travel, and anti-ghosting technology. 4 zones of lighting control. 20-million keystroke durability.* DVD: As the current trend, there is no DVD drive. Iâm now accustomed to that, so donât miss it. You can connect USB to an external DVD (eg Apple DVD drive worked) if you must.The laptop comes with Windows 10 Home as the OS. Both MS Office and MS OneDrive came pre-installed but unactivated. I used Control Panel | Programs and Features to uninstall both products, as this is targeted to be a development machine. I installed Oracleâs VirtualBox to run virtual machines. With quad cores, this is a good host for VMs.There is a numeric keypad, which would be good for accounting and tax chores. I loved the backlit keyboard and the ability to change the backlit colors with the pre-installed ASUS app. The touch pad did not have individual buttons, but was more of a universal pad where when you click on the left it is a one-click and if you click on the right it is a double-click. It took me about thirty minutes to get used to it, but now I like it.Since there are two WIFI adapters, you can connect to WIFI, and also share that WIFI with other devices, creating a hotspot. No cellular though â?wouldnât that have been a dream?Regarding the 1.25TB of space: The space is 256GB of SSD on which the OS is installed, and 1TB of HDD space that is available for end-user storage. The 1TB drive is end-user replaceable.The display is a very crisp 15.6â?full HD screen (1920 x 1080 pixels). This is *not* a touch screen, although I keep trying.The logo that appears on the back of the metal (aluminum?) lid lights up. Although the lid is nice, the base of the unit is plastic.The lithium ion battery life is OK â?generally I got less than five hours of varied use including installing software. This workstations does have quad cores after all, and youâll definitely hear the fan when it kicks on. The power brick is huge (not great for travel), but it does tend to charge the laptop quickly (within two hours).All in all this is a fast Windows laptop that could serve as a solid gaming or development platform, and Iâm happy with it.I hope you found this review helpful!
Great design in a little package. everything feels solid, with good materials all around. The 1 year of accidental damage warranty included is the icing on the cake!It is finally good to see ASUS adding an RGB keyboard to the gaming series, although I havent had time to play with the settings yet, the default lighting is pretty cool alreadyI bought this laptop for video editing and some various graphics design workI appreciate the fact that SSD is large enough for me to install my programs on it and there is also an HDD so I can store my video and processing files on that.so far the installation and opening of the adobe software are fastnext up is installing PUBGI havent ran any benchmarks yet, ill update this post when I do so. So far so good thoughNot experiencing what the previous 2 (Vine) reviewers have experienced, I got the 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD in my laptop and everything runs fine, no hiccups, no stuttering
This is a pretty good laptop and does have all the specs described in the product listing. However, the problem is that the listing is intentionally vague when it comes to giving out the laptop's model number.The listing says, "Item Model Number: HP PAVILION 15.6 TOUCH I5", however as anyone knows who bothered to Google the term, this is not a real model number.This laptop's model number is actually 15-bs095ms and I encourage everyone to search Amazon and Google before buying. That way you can be sure you're getting the best prices. Right now (1/25/2018) there are other Amazon listings for this same laptop which are cheaper.
I just un-boxed this laptop. This laptop is incorrectly advertised on here. It has all of the correct specs however the model is not what they have listed in the description. The real model is 15-bs095ms, This same model is for sale in a few other places on amazon for a bit cheaper. Make sure you do some research on this model before you buy. I am liking it so far, but it is not the model that they list. I will update my rating as time progresses.
Ordered this as a replacement for a laptop that died after less than 2 months. So far I am loving it! Set up was super easy, and it is running beautifully.
Happy with my purchase! Came in brand new packaging and all is working well (including touch screen). Was able to look up HP limited warranty. Looks like a great machine. Will update my review if anything changes.
Iâm having problems with the battery the laptop will not work unless plugged in Iâve asked for a customer support to contact me and Iâve never been contacted still waiting to be contacted can you provide me help
Product description did not match the computer. I put in a question about why the computer did nothave 1 of the 3 top features I bought it for.....NO RETURN MESSAGE WAS EVER RECEIVED FROM VENDOR.
It is slower my previous HP i-core 5 business laptop. It is a great device, smooth keyboard, nice look. Love it!
I checked the setting and it does not have touch screen!! It might be a nice laptop, but they have the wrong info from it. Also mine came from Stamples on the box but some other seller was on the invoice.Should have bought one right from HP. $200+ for the HP ENVY Laptop -15t touch
Started up right away instead of making me wait for it to update. No bloatware. None of the minor irritants I have had with other new PCs. Boots fast, so far no issues. I wanted the 2Tmemory for photos, and love that I have room to grow. It is fast enough for the few games I play. No issues.
I've only had this for 20 days, and now it wont turn on all the time. When it does, it is supper slow. When I went to return it, it wont let me because it states the return period has expired. HELP can't buy another laptop in just 20 days.
Not too impressed with the computer itself. From the time I started it up, it took between 5 to 10 minutes to go from a black screen to the home screen. Then after that I got a blue screen and the computer just seems to have a lot of issues that aren't worked out yet and I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it or not. Seems like just too many issues for brand new computer and then it just kept doing updates which a new computer shouldn't have to do that.
The laptop was extremely slow. did not give a feel of a new laptop. I am an IT professional and had to run heavy softwares and virtual machines. this laptop didnt work and i had to return it.
The HDD on this laptop is soooooo slow. It's a real bottleneck that will allow you down. Windows updates take hours. Programs that use lots of disk writes will slow you to a crawl. Other than that, it's a good laptop.
After about 25 minutes of updates, works great, nice touch screen. Sound from Speakers is Good but not Great. Nice clear screen. I dont do gaming so I can speak to speed but for standard usage this is good deal for the money.
This really is a little work horse. Very light. Touch screen is awesome. Quiet, easy to use. Very worth the money
Great laptop computer! Fast and has lots of memory and huge hard drive! 2TBs! So fast! Love it! Great price!
After fully updating this laptop. My girlfriend loves her new play-toy. This laptop worths like a charm for her. It isnt no gaming laptop or have the power and speed of a beast desktop. But for someone who uses it for work and home, it works great.
Really it was not what I expected, it is very slow to have a fast processor, the capacity of 2 TB occupy 1 TB and became slower, you could hear a noise like a loose piece inside the equipment, and it turned out to be a loose screw , that left me a lot to be desired, because I understand that in my country Guatemala, I do not have warranty coverage, it is likely that Windows 8 is faster, but Windows 10 is a turtle. I have an Acer I3 two generations earlier and it is much faster
Runs great and fast. Windows 10 had its usual issues with updates but that's not a fault of the laptop. The touchscreen is responsive but I don't think I will use that much.
I have had this laptop from etech for three months. It is totally locked up. will not function at all. I did not realize it was not sold by amazon.. I want to return but of course it is past the return period.
Don't buy this computer the battery doesn't last 4 hours. This is messed up!!!!!!
100% disc usage with no programs running. Re-installation, driver and bios updates, nothing helps. The computer has a massive lag even when it merely runs text processing programs. Complete waste of money and neither seller nor customer support are helpful. No HP product, ever again.
What can I say except it's a $500 laptop. Constantly freezes up and the touchscreen becomes unresponsive. They don't even tell you how to set the computer up. Needless to say, I spent about a half hour trying to get help with the problem from the oh-so-competent support staff. *sarcasm*, It's worth it to spend an additional 500-700 bucks on a brand new computer that doesn't act like it's about to die.
The battery died in 60 days. Tried to contact seller who has not responded.Hope they change their mind.
Bought this computer for my dad who doesn't do anything to really extensive. He loves it and has zero complaints that is why I'm giving it 5 stars also VERY speedy delivery during the holidays.
Very very very slow processor , I hate my laptop, very bad performance of lapy,
Bought this computer late January 2018, it's been running slower and slower and I've now found out the disc is 100% full when I'm not running any programs and have not been using this computer to store files. Complete waste of money and will not purchase from this seller ever again. This is the first time I've been let down buying through Amazon.
Very economical Laptop PC with adequate speed and features
Definitely enjoy. However the transfer of data from my other computer has been time consuming
Solid laptop for the price. For 8 gigs of ram and a dual core processor, it ran pretty slow in the beginning. I closed out some of the bloatware and itâs been solid. Still runs a bit slower than I expected, but overall itâs been decent. Speakers are good for a laptop. Video quality is pretty good as well.
I like the computer, however battery life might be an issue. I've never had a laptop before so have nothing to compare it to.
works great so far
Came brand new. Arrived on time. Laptop works great. Excellent purchase.
I bought laptop Dec 2017. Been out of town and didnât open til a few days ago and getting info input. On the 3rd day It wonât even turn on. This is junk!
This computer was nothing but problems from the time I first started it until it was returned.
Windows 10 is too clever for this old man. Can I get it changed to a simpler and less fancy system? Windows 10 is driving me crazy, wasting time and generating anger and frustration
Will take too long to start and then slow like a turtle!! What a disaster HP is selling to loyal customers to loose market share!
My husband bought this for me and I absolutely love it. I'm still getting use to having a touchscreen. It's lightweight and perfect size.
This is a great laptop for the price. Love the touchscreen, it makes it easier to move between devices like smartphones and tablets by using the screen to navigate. Sound is decent and the screen looks good with pictures or videos.
I liked!
It is grwat very fast love it
It did everything that I wanted and performance was great
Must buy. Received on time. Excellent machine. Liked it a lot.
Great performance and reliability
Perfect for college bound.
Bought from another seller. LOVE it!
it had all that I expected though it is a bit slow.
It exceeds expectations and simple to use. Great buy!!!
Enjoy every minute of it. Good buy, don't regret it!
Great laptop
I like it is so big . The voice was so good
Great Laptop no complaints
I like the most!!!
Didn't come with a charger
Plenty cool.love it
could have a better graphics card, but frankly its not a bad pc.about two weeks in and nothing to complain aboutthe memory is NOT 2 tb. it's sata memory so it's only 1.8tb. regardless for the price its a great deal.I hope to make this computer last at least 7 years, i think it can do it if you take care of it and organize properly.I bought this computer for 477, about two days later i see it listed for 450, then the next day I see it listed at 495 with a bundle that comes with a mouse and bag for only 450. a bit confusing but I feel like i was looking at a different computer even though everything was listed the same.
Still learning Windows 10. Love having a full keyboard AND touch screen.Had no instructions on Win 10, so getting up to speed was slow.
I've had this lap top for over a month. It is so slow that I can't even check my email or move a file from my desktop to another folder in 30 minutes. I was going to factory reset it, but now it won't even turn on. Definitely $500 down the drain. 100% do not recommend this lap top at all.
I researched and researched and read reviews and more reviews until my head was spinning. I love my laptop. Good decision to buy this one. Its fast and easy to use. Set up was straightforward and simple. Love my laptop.
Wife still making transition. Working well.
sale very good staffs
I purchased this computer and the hard drive did not work properly. I returned it.
Technically Laptop meets description. Operates fast, boots fast and so on. But laptop made of plastic (feel like cheap plastic) and looks like it is very thin and fragile. Next moment i dislike is that screen can't lean backwards more then 45-50 degrees, which means when you work with laptop on your knees you can not see clear picture until u lean whole laptop backwards.
Love it is great!
I've had it for almost two weeks, I couldn't find a better one with 15 inches touch!
Working out very good so far, fast, easy set up, works great. Delivery was better then expected plus it was a day early then we thought, thank you!
I just got it a few days ago and already got the Hard disk (3FO). Ran all hard drive checks and still said it couldnât find it. What a horrible purchase, Iâll be returning it
It's a great laptop. It would have been better with keyboard lighting. But I love it.
The actual computer specifications are different from the specifications in the advertisement .... The seller is not honest in the specifications
The battery lasted for only 2 hours and it glitched even when i tried to reset the laptop and it wont reset
Great computer but gets one star do to the fact it is suppose to be brand new and when I got it finger prints all over it and multiple keys on the key board do not work I donât buy on amazon to get stuff that doesnât work this was I very big let down as it was a gift , now wonât get it in time for Christmas.
don't waste your time... and don't buy it... I brought it and had to return it because I couldn't use this.
I received my Brand New HP i5 7200U from Amazon last March 4. I tried to open but it was not open, so I just assumed it was battery drained. So I charged it maybe more than a hour but still can't charge. The led light indicator also not working or have no light. What I did is immediately inform Amazon and seller that the unit I received is dead on arrival. And until now ( April 3, 2018) still they not working. All of their suggestions are useless and impossible:1. They advise me to return the item from Qatar to US. Unfortunately all of the carrier like DHL etc here in Qatar are not accepting laptop specially if it is defective.2. They advise me to repair at Authorized HP Service Center, and I did also, but they need the Valid Invoice in order to repair under warranty otherwise if without invoice they will repair under post warranty and I will pay for the cost. But seller (TECH & TOYS )and Amazon cannot provide me a VALID INVOICE. VALID INVOICE is the only way in order to repair without any cost at my side amounting $340. Just a piece of paper ( VALID INVOICE ) they wont provide.So just want to share my experience and reminders specially for those ordering outside US to think many times before you place your order to them. Possible it will happen.
Its an OK laptop. I've been using it for about 3 months. Had an issue at start up, getting a 90B error which is a fan failure. Contacted HP support and they wanted to charge me $52 for a home visit to address the issue. I asked why I have to pay for this and they said its absolutely free.I just have to pay for the home visit. I replied $52 isn't free. I asked for other options and HP support said "you can ship it back to us but you have to pay the shipping". I asked if they could just ship me a new fan and I would install myself. They said sure it costs $45 plus shipping. I since took a look at the fan and the plug wasn't on correctly, reinstalled plug and haven't had had an issue since. I would look at other brands!
I was nervous about ordering a computer online. It shipped quickly, was well-packed, and arrived in great condition. As a student, I was worried about being without a computer, but this one arrived in time to get some essential work completed!!! Thank you. The computer itself seems great. I have never set one up before and it gives prompts to guide you. I had fortunately backed-up my previous computer files on a thumb drive. They installed without issue.Thanks again for the amazingly fast service and what appears to be a nice computer.
Very disappointed, the keyboard randomly freeze by itself.
Warning, this computer does NOT come with a BACKLIT KEYBOARD! The description was misleading. Did not match the MODEL SENT!
Let me start off by saying that I did a lot of research into this model before deciding to buy, so I have no idea why other reviews are complaining about features not included. I strongly considered the Dell XPS 13 and similar ultrabooks in this price/feature range. I decided to go with the gram for a number of reasons, which include the ability to add RAM and storage.I have had it for a few days and I am extremely impressed with what LG has done with the latest version of the gram. After seeing previous models and having one or two things that really turned me off (the camera located by the hinge), I am thrilled to see that LG listened to customer feedback and made changes.The 8th generation i5 has proven quite fast and I have not had any issues with any of what I have thrown at it. Battery life is excellent, but I have not put the 22 hours to the test yet. I am currently on battery saver and at 75% remaining it says I have 17 hours and 25 minutes left. The fan isnât silent on load but it isnât crazy loud either â?I would classify it as normal. I do like that the fan vent openings face to the rear of the computer (see video) instead of facing down. This allows it to stay cooler when it is being used on your lap, the air can escape.The fit and form of the laptop is top notch. It does not feel flimsy or cheap and does not flex or bend. I do not think that there will be any issues, it feels sturdy and well-made. The screen is sharp, clear, and plenty bright. I really like the keyboard and the touchpad. I think LG did a great job with the keys, they have just the right amount of travel. I would call the touchpad good, I have not had any issues with it so far. I also like the Fn buttons, particularly the keyboard backlight, touchpad on/off, and reader mode (reduces blue light).Unfortunately, the Windows 10 it came with had all kinds of bloatware. I attached the screenshot of the used space on the hard drive when I received it (35.6 GB) and when I formatted and put a fresh install of Windows 10 Home back on and added the LG drivers/software from the website (16.8 GB). The difference is crazy, I would recommend that everyone wipe their systems, reinstall Windows, and download the LG software. It saves a ton of space and give you a lot more control of what is on your system. This isnât just advice for this particular laptop, but really any computer you buy these days.I did not want a fingerprint reader, I did not want an i7, I did not want a touchscreen. I wanted a fast, 8th generation, extremely portable computer for grad school and everything that comes with that (video chat, internet use, writing, etc.). I also wanted the longest possible battery life â?which is why this model is perfect for me. So far it has delivered and I am extremely pleased with the new gram.I will update this review if anything changes.Pros:It is extremely lightUpgradeableIt is a great looking computerThe keyboard and touchpad are fantasticCons:No Fn key on the right side of the keyboard (personal preference)No Thunderbolt 3Bloatware (which all companies do these days)
Can't quite attest to the battery life yet, but the bugger took forever to charge, and it was nearly empty out of the box, so that says something. I've got brightness on the screen almost to max, Word, Excel, Firefox, and Chrome open, as well as the usual background mess of integrations, bluetooth and wifi on etc, and it's estimating 9 hours. I'm inclined to believe it. If I can get through my entire workday (I literally do not leave the computer, I work a solid 10-12 hours a go), that will be a commendable record.It's extremely snappy. Loading tabs on browsing, loading complicated spreadsheets with scripts and scrolling pages, it all works fine. Connected to my gaming PC and streamed some Doom 2016 and Half Life 2 just to see how that would work out, and it does very well with some noticeable but acceptable lag (though I needed to switch to 5G band). Don't expect e sports over wifi, kids. Haven't tested any gaming running on the actual hardware, but I would think it's pretty garbage for any graphically intense games. Not going to be a great one for that, but that's not the purpose here. 1080p youtube and netflix runs and looks great with no tearing or other visual noise, so hard to complain there, the IGPU is doing well enough for that.There aren't a ton of ports, but what's there is good enough. Running my SteelSeries Rival 100 because I refuse to sacrifice on mouse quality. The trackpad is fine and will do well enough on something like an airplane ride, and I appreciate the ability to right click. Tried charging through the USB C port and can report that it prevented the PC from dying, though it recommended I plug in something with 10W or higher rating in order to actually charge the machine, so I may try that out. With the computer almost dead, I went to bed and the USB-C had charged it by the morning, so it certainly works when it's not drawing power. Good to know I probably won't have to depend on the proprietary charger if it goes bad or gets damaged.The inclusion of Bluetooth and Wireless makes it pretty easy to hook up plenty of externals, and my 60% mechanical bluetooth keyboard worked swimmingly. I really thought I would need it for this machine, but to be honest, if you're trying to incognito type a bunch of notes while you're on calls with clients, this keyboard is a hell of a lot quieter, and is honestly kind of incredible. There's a satisfying punch on the keys, and they seem spaced and sized well. The throw on the keys is obviously very short, but you do get the feeling you're typing and not just touching a flat surface. Feels just as good as the Macbook Pro. I'm a very large person and it's working out for me. I'm a solid 90wpm on a variety of mechanical keyboards, and my first ten runs with this thing were frankly ridiculous: I keyed in at just shy of 101. It's a great keyboard, and I think I might just have to leave the 60% for longer trips when I know I'll want to use the laptop more as a desktop than anything else. I will be adding a numerical mechanical bluetooth keypad because of my data entry needs, but this little guy will do amazingly well for the glut of emails and notes I have to take throughout a day.The screen is great. Not as good as the MacBook, but close enough for work that it doesn't mater. Off axis viewing is is true to color and you'll be able to collaborate on a screen if need be. The size takes almost full advantage, beveling is super small and looks great. I got mine in the white finish because the silver wasn't available, and I'll deal with that because it was cheaper. I don't do any sort of content creation or color work, but everything looks pretty great, almost up to snuff with my desktop monitor. No, you don't get the density of other laptop screens, but brightness is acceptable and color and contrast are great, and the 1080p panel scales well and keeps the battery life going.To be honest, it feels like a lightweight version of the MacBook Pro. The build quality isn't quite up to that snuff, but it is very solid, I'm sure it will hold up nearly as well, and I'll take the weight tradeoff since the warranty is so cheap. You don't get the same peripherals, but to be honest almost nobody actually uses all those freaking Thunderbolt ports, can we all stop pretending? The company wanted to get me into one of those, but I really don't like their ecosystem or their interface. Apple has just never been as intuitive for me as it seems to be for everyone else. Anyway, since every dollar I spend eventually comes out of my paycheck, I wanted to find something reasonable that would last through a long flight with snappy performance and wouldn't make me look like a teenager with a gaming laptop. Grabbing a Macbook of any sort was going to be another 1-2000 dollars, and the performance would have been identical.I guess that's kind of the thing here. If you need something that actually gets real work done, looks professional, is incredibly lightweight and compact, and won't need to be plugged into the wall all day, this is as good as it gets in this price point. You can spend twice as much for the exact same hardware specs and a prettier screen with that sweet Apple logo, but you'll be laughing with the extra thousand dollars you have in your pocket when some Jobs acolyte is looking for a wall charger and you've still got 30%.
Where do I even start with this thing? It's so nice, literally, have your friend pick it up and watch their face. They will be amazed at how light it is. Then show them the benchmarks...and mention the battery life. This laptop has made my mind blow.Display:The display is very vibrant, even though it's nowhere close to being OLED, the blacks are very deep, and everything is very vibrant. Not sure how color accurate it is, but man it looks awesome. It's 1080p, which is totally fine, it's only 13.3" and you only see pixels if you put your face up to the screen. The bezels are very small, which makes it seem super futuristic. It doesn't get super bright, but for me, that isn't too big of a deal. I came from a 2014 13" MacBook Pro w/ Retina Display, and it's not quite 'Retina' quality, but that's why this gets 12 hours of battery and the Mac gets 5.Design:Personally, if I had to make the purchase again, I'd opt for the gray one. The white is very pretty, but it's less than a week old at this point and it is a little dirty already. Not a huge deal as I wipe it down when I see a smudge, but just make sure to always have handy wipes available if you want your laptop to look good. The overall look isn't gaudy, and nobody will recognize it from a distance, but man the 'gram' insignia on the lid looks classy. Like really good. The plastic bezel is okay, not my favorite, but what are you gonna do?Build Quality:The display flexes A LOT! Like you're not ready for it. However, other than that, it feels premium, yet cheap at the same time. When you take the laptop out of your bag for the first time of the day, you'll feel the cold metal, but then you start to feel that it's plastic. The Nano-Carbon Magnesium Alloy is nice, however, it can be felt as plastic, which is the carbon layer on top of the magnesium. Not a huge deal, but something you might want to watch out for.Battery:It's crazy long, crazy crazy. I unplug it at 6:45 AM and use it all day until about 4 PM and it's only at 40%. I'm so not even sure how they made it so good. It's 72 Wh, which is huge, especially for a laptop that's so small and that only has a 1080p display. Most other laptops at this price point and especially ones that are this thin and light don't even come close to the battery life of this thing.Performance:The new 8th-gen Core processors are just awesome. They have very little power draw, yet they're super powerful. My old Mac had a 4th-generation dual-core i7. This thing more than doubled the performance of that, it's incredible. The 8GB of ram gets used up quickly, so I'd recommend upgrading to 16GB by yourself, just buy another 8GB SODIMM on Amazon, and pop it in yourself.Keyboard & Trackpad:The keyboard is pretty good, a bit mushy, but personally, I prefer this. The trackpad is using Windows Precision drivers, which makes it very usable. It feels natural, not quite as good as the Mac trackpad, but honestly way better than I would have thought. LG really hit it out of the park on this keyboard/trackpad combo.Verdict:Absolutely pick up this laptop if you're a performance enthusiast and someone who wants a 2lb laptop that has enough power for the day and enough battery to let you work for more than 12 hours straight. Buy one, now. You won't regret it. I promise.
This was an upgrade for my wife. I initially had settled on a reconditioned XPS 13 but the more I read about the re-sellers the more it sound like a crap shot. Also, portability was the biggest factor for her so the LG Gram seemed the best fit. I added an USB fingerprint scanner for $30. I was impressed the light weight, compactness and general speed of the machine. Also, IPS screen is just brilliant. Makes me hate my work laptop (Dell E7270). LG did not pack that much bloat software on it and I only had to uninstall some unnecessary software. With machines like this around it really makes you wonder how Apple sells it's Airbooks anymore. Fashion victims?No, this is not a gaming laptop but let's be real, for gaming, you should be using a desktop.
This laptop is exactly what I need. I have a powerful gaming desktop and I do all the heavy stuff on it. But I need a laptop to use in the meeting and do some lightweight coding on the go. This LG gram is as light as a real notebook. I install Ubuntu on it and every thing works fine except the type-C charging port, since I didn't have a 45W power brick, this is not a big deal for me. Speaking of the battery, I use it on the work and I can even leave the charge in my house and it can still last from 9am to 6am without any problem.However, I have two small complaints:1) The palmrest is kinda loose and create some noise when press it. I fastened the two screws on the bottom and fixed it.2) The speaker is bad. Use headphone.
Excellent product - Lightweight, great battery. the only reason for a 4 star is I wish they had a model with more memory and larger hard drive. I'd buy that also! Otherwise, no complaints!
Absolutely perfect for our mobile business laptop. Quick, light, thin and error free. Quality is similar to Apple products.
Awesome computer. Light and fast.
my favorite laptop
Light and powerful battery. But why the 8G memory made up by 4G on board and 4G on the slot? This means you can only remove the 4G memory and add a 8G memory, only 12G for you. Why this stupid design used for this PC??
Having been searching for a light, powerful, beautiful, all-day-battery laptop with not just a single usb c port; it totally fits all my needs. Highly recommended.
All things considered it is a very nice laptop. The build quality is good, the screen is good and the keyboard also. In general everything "just works" which is exactly what I wanted. I'm not sure if the claimed 22hours of battery life is possible under linux but it certainly does well over 14 because at one point I had it running for about that long thinking it was powered up and then discovering that the wall socket wasn't switched on.I bought this expecting to be forced to run Windows 10 on it - which wouldn't be terrible but was not what I wanted. To my pleased surprise when I tried to install Xubuntu 17.10 it installed flawlessly and the upgrade shortly afterwards to 18.04 was equally painless.I have kept w10 on it too to dual boot and w10 works fine too. The upgrade to the latest w10 version was also problem free.
This is a sweet little machine. As a long-time Mac user, I immediately categorize this as an "Air class machine", and if you were considering this or a 13-inch Air, this stacks up well. (I am comparing to a 13-inch Air with 256GB SSD storage, which on the Apple site right now is $1199.)Some comparisons:1. Both have 8GB of memory and a 256 GB SSD hard drive2. This (the LG) weighs about 2 pounds, and the Air weighs about 3 pounds. So that makes the LG better for schlepping around3. The LG has a touch screen and fingerprint sensor (the power button)4. Hmmm. My LG says that it has an intel i7-8550ou cpu, which is 1.8GHz and an max turbo of 4.0 GHz. But the listing for this machine says that it's intel i5-8550ou. Huh. I was shipped a 13Z980-A.AAS7U1, which is a nicer machine, with a SRP of $1399, according to the LG website. Well, that explains why it's silver and not white.Well, okay, it's time for me to stop, since I can't tell you about the machine you're considering.But look at the actual chips being used, the capacity of the hard drive, the available screen resolutions, the ports, and touchscreen/fingerprint type features.
this is a good laptop for most use cases except for heavy gaming. But I will recommend the 14 inch version over this, as both have the same footprint, only 14 inch version has thinner bezels
Like another reviewer, I ended up with an upgraded version of the base-model you see here. So, while I ordered this one, I actually received the 13Z980-A.AAS7U1.Pros:-This is super compact, super thin, and super light.-This is great for work (especially if you commute via public transportation when every ounce counts).-Likewise, great for students with backpacks full of chemistry and calculus books (this adds very little extra weight).-The battery life is impressive (about sixteen hours).-The back-lit keyboard has three settings. It is a nice touch. (It is especially great for the student in your life who is sharing a dorm room and trying to knock-out that overnight paper!)-The matte finish makes this fairly fingerprint resistant.Neutral:-Emulates MacBook layout and ports. (Great if that is a layout you enjoy/prefer).Cons:-There are warnings that state that this computer is known to cause cancer and that the user should wash one's hands after use. Hence, this may not be the best choice for children and adolescents (who may forget to wash their hands).-Although the hinges on the screen are excellent, the screen does slightly wobble as one types.-While not rated for gaming, do know that this laptop will not perform well with games like Dragon Age II or Witcher 3. So, if you were hoping that this could be your gaming computer on the side, you might need a more a powerful laptop.All told, I was truly impressed with the overall capabilities of this laptop. It is fantastic for travel, great for spreadsheets, perfect for watching videos, and has almost ZERO bloatware (I was really pleased with that!).Highly recommended!
Everything is good, except I did not know this item does not have fingerprint.. (I thought all 2018 gram models have fingerprint option like Korea version)
I purchased this product on March 24, 2018, all is working well so far. Except that after I purchased this product, Amazon decided to reduce the price point from $1,096 to $999... That's why I give it a 3 star ratings... Other than that, this device is functioning perfectly well as of my first day of using it, today.
I returned it and am waiting for refund. Everything seemed to be good at first. However, the battery description was not correct. More decisively, the laptop has "the device may now cause harmful interferences" on the back of the laptop with a tiny font. That was literally true. I felt them strongly and suffered from a headache and mal-digestion. This is the first time experience from a laptop, which I never worried about before. I think that LG must recall the products. I am now more sensitive to EMF(Electronic Magnetic Field) due to the experience.
PC laptop was shipped early, came in good shape. Everything was included as purchased. I am using it now and it performs very fast. I have only HP computers so I expected to get a good product. It came with HP Elite Premium Support; I had a question so I called the help number - as they advertised there are no phone trees and a real English speaking person answered the phone. I had no hassle with him, no need to identify myself - he just started helping me. The reason I called was because Windows 10 sometimes messes up with the initial password - which defaults to a Microsoft e-mail. I had that problem and had to restart and recover the system from the backup D: drive on the system. It restored perfectly and I was very careful in setting up the initial password to be sure that I had the correct password for the Microsoft e-mail account. Everything is fine now. The HP agent stayed with me until I knew everything was working perfectly. BTW, the price for the laptop was very good - I did a lot of checking of other sites before I purchased from Amazon.
Been messing with this for a few weeks now, and so far it's pretty decent for the price. I got this for my girlfriend as a cheap alternative gaming laptop since we're on a tight budget. This is no where near something like an alienware laptop for instance, but for the games we've installed its definitely serviceable. We were running Mortal Combat X on it at medium settings the game was playable but would chug at times. It feels a little cheap in terms of its construction quality and is not a rugged machine but if that doesn't bother you its very functional for the price. As well the screen is a little de-saturated and not the highest resolution, but again this is a trade off for the price. On the one we received one of the USB ports its pretty tight but otherwise works fine. Probably one of my biggest concerns for this computer is the battery. The battery life isn't very good, at all probably because the battery is tiny. If you're just using this for typing, viewing documents or maybe some web browsing with the brightness all the way down you can get 4 - 5 hours tops on this. If you're for instance playing even an easily run game on the machine with 15 - 25% brightness you may get 1 - 2 hours tops.So for the price its a decent choice for what you're getting out of it. Quality isn't the word I would use to describe it, but functional with a good potential for the price.
After looking at pricey laptops with the same or similar specs, I bought this one. It is for my daughter, great video, super fast she loves it, and $900 less than apple.
Not the best laptop I have ever used. This was bought for use at the office, when working at home and when traveling for work. As a small nonprofit I was looking for something that was not to expensive but would handle daily use for Microsoft Offiice, Quickbooks, and our online data entry service. There are two issues I continually have with this laptop and that is the screen/mouse will start jumping to different screens in the middle of working on something else and the internet will drop making me reboot the computer to get it back.For the screen issue - the mouse will move around on it's own and then the screen will show all the different programs I have open, i.e. word, excel, internet, etc. It does not matter if it is 2 or 5 programs. It is really irritating when you are in the middle of typing and it switches screens. There is no rhyme or reason to when it happens.The second issue is the internet/wifi will drop or not start up. The only way to get it to start again is to restart the computer. Sometimes when traveling for work, it will not connect to the wifi at a hotel.However, for the price it is a reasonable laptop which I have been using for a year now. Next time though I will invest in something a little more reliable so that I do not waste my time dealing with these issues.
Even after a lot of troubleshooting and updates to programs and drivers, many issues. Slow performance (opening programs, startup, etc.), keyboard lag when typing, extremely fast battery drain, slow wireless internet connection (running 300mbps through router and can only get about 50mbps max on computer...even my cell phone was pulling 260+mbps), and Ethernet port was defective and does not work. Extremely disappointed especially for the price paid. Computer now at Lenova repair for possible repair/fix. We will see. All I know is I will never buy a Lenova again!!!! I have never written a review previously, but felt I had no option other than leave one for this product.
I bought this laptop for school. I am currently a Computer Science major, and this computer has been able to handle the code that I have thrown at it so far. (JS, node.JS, Python, php, and SQL). It's substantially lighter than my last computer, and smaller which is awesome. Enough storage for my needs. I've not tested any games on here, as I don't want to tempt myself to play games when I should be studying or working, but I would guess that it would hold up to a decent standard. All in all, its awesome, and I'd get it again.
Do not buy this laptop. I am surprised Amazon is still selling this brick. It does not start-up. I called Lenovo and they just said return it to sender. It has hardware issues. It may be missing the windows 10 program.
Wow this thing is quick. It runs my heavy programs with ease. No more bogging down in my 3D design or video editing.
This laptop worked great at first but slowly degraded over time. If you close the screen, there is no clearance between the screen and the keyboard; this creates marks on the screen that cannot be removed. The computer is also prone to randomly shutting down which makes it heavily inconvenient for nearly any prolonged use; at first I thought it was related to overheating when I gamed on it, but even using Chrome has caused the computer to shutdown after a few minutes of use. The computer also has issues with running multiple programs at once and will freeze, which is unexpected since it's a quad-core. Of course, this all started happening after I installed new drivers for all the components though the device manager, so perhaps it's an unfair judgement that might just be an issue with a bad driver installation.Update: Installed latest drivers, installed latest bios, installed Windows 10 again. Keep getting "thread stuck in driver". Various people have issues with this laptop and Lenovo blamed the operating system and refused to service it in warranty unless I proved it was the hardware, but I am not a computer technician. Hardware is failing, warranty is already nearly out of date when computer arrives leaving no time to return Lenovo for repairs. Do not buy.
GREAT laptop--SERIOUS battery hog...so be aware of that when purchasing.
I cannot stream Netflix or videos on this computer without it dropping the wi-fi signal. There must be something wrong with the wi-fi card. I know the problem isnât with my internet service-I bought a Roku and that streams just fine. I bought this laptop when it when it first got listed on Amazon. I wish I had waited to see any reviews listed before buying it. Based on what customers are saying about it, I would not purchase it now.
Just got it. Having a Windows start-up issue trying to start-up. The laptop is having a major issue. I'll get to a point to the initial configuration, and pointer locks up. I must then hard reboot by taking the battery out. May have to return.
Lenovo Quad-Core AMD FX-7500 APU up to 3.30 GHz, 16GB DDR3, 1TB HDD, AMD Radeon R7, DVDRW, WLAN, Bluetooth, Windows 10Ever since I bought the laptop, it was very slow. I hardly had anything installed in it. Bought it for my grade school kids. They uses google drive to save everything. Kids have kept complaining about how slow the laptop was, but I ignored them. A week ago, I used the laptop to go online and noticed it was slow. I tried using different sites, installed chrome, Firefox and IE. They were all showed performance. I took the laptop to a reputable service center. They diagnosed it and found out that the hard drive came with the laptop was terrible and not functioning property I had to replace the hard drive and get much smaller HD with 250GB. It cost me $230 in total. If I had known this when I bought it, I would have never bought this form this Seller: Sold by: U-DIGi.
So far no issues. Runs quick with no sales ware pre loaded on it.
Awesome laptop for the price!! Fast, long battery life, everything loaded up fast, & it came with no preloaded junk! A+++ Great buy!!
Love it!!!! It has the same features as some of the others I was looking at. Some additional features for less money. I like Lenovo products. Image is great and shipping was fast. Definitely would buy again.
BUYER BEWARE. Thought this was a smoking hot deal in August 2017, less than 8 months ago. Then the Laptop stopped working under battery power. Battery fine, not a memory issue as this was as simple a unplugging the charger, all functions stop working, reboot, plug it in it works fine. When I started down this rabbit hole, I discovered that Lenovo does not warranty items manufactured over 8 years ago. I look for the manufacture date, it is DECEMBER 2005, my "NEW" laptop was built 12 years ago. The Seller is no longer on Amazon, Amazon says not my problem, same for LENOVO. Listing clearly stated new, but I guess I'm stupid. When I buy another laptop that works, it will be at BEST BUY.
Really fast machine, the only problem I had is the continuos "oh-no" message from chrome
This computer is better than I thought it was going to be. It's lighting quick easy to maneuver around on it. Tons of extras. Definitely a great buy.
Not very significant for gaming. Can handle skyrim: special edition on medium graphics while being slightly choppy at the beginning. The rest is fine, like 25 fps and higher while outside. It looks slick at least, very casual. A "chrome" trimming around the mouse pad (I think it's just foil). A definite upgrade from my G50 - 45 amd A8 with 8 gigs of ram (came with 4)
The laptop was completely dead on arrival. As soon as I started it up, it immediately blue screened. When I took it in to be looked at, no matter what component parts were switched in, it would not work, suggesting a motherboard malfunction. Do not buy this laptop. It is far wiser to spend a couple hundred extra dollars and get something that works.
Do not buy this junky laptop. Slowest laptop I have ever used no after a month of using it the battery will not last longer then a half hour so it must stay plugged in. Constantly freezes up while in use and unreliable. Now I have to pay for the good one should have just bought the good one up front live and learn the seller will not honor my request for return. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this computer
I got this for my dad and he has been using it for a few months now without issues. Runs good and was very easy to set up for him.
great laptop and does we need it to do - some spreadsheets, word and cruise the net - perfect
It meets my needs but it is slow and I had some trouble with excel crashing on it. However it is able to run an android emulator
This is a great Laptop. The AMD FX is an awesome processor. I ordered 5 of these for our office and they all work great. They fire up fast. They run any application that I've used so far with ease. The only downside to this laptop is the slow WiFi card. It is definitely under powered for this machine. We have 150 Mbps WiFi capabilities in our offices. These laptops can't seem to clear 54 Mbps speeds over WiFi.
Laptop does not boot up. Fresh out the box. It will power on, but locks up at the Lenovo screen prompt. Such a shame because Lenovo's are usually extremely reliable. But I suspect that this third party seller is either tampering with the units or they purchased a big batch of possibly defective units and are selling them. Avoid
Great for surfing the net, but wish it would connect to the faster 5.0 WiFi band.
The computer I owned before this one was a Lenovo and I really liked it because it lasted about 7-8 years but this computer must be a stripped down version of what I had because it is about as fast as my 8 year old computer. If I had known it would be this slow, I would have spent some extra money on a better computer. Just thought I would warn the next person.
AWESOME laptop, best laptop I have ever bought, especially for the price
$420.00 - bought on August 21st 2017, on Jan 3rd 2018 it died. Bought the old Lenovo Thinkpad in 2010, still going. VERY unhappy.
Works well, but doesn't come with word, so get ready to drop $150
So far so good! The mouse pad location is kind of annoying, but other than that it's all good!
I guess I got the lemon. After initial start up it stopped working (AC & battery). Would not restart and had to be returned (on my dime). Also I noted the product was made in early 2016 I thought it was a 2017 version.
The performance of this laptop was very good. However, within 4 months the hard drive shut down. We are in the process of returning it to be fixed since it is still under a one year warranties.
OUTSTANDING,this computer is beast...the processer in this laptop is shocking powerful...the Wi-Fi range is over 100ft inside to outside the house...I am seriously thinking about buying another one for work.....I have had 5 other computers and none are even close to this laptops power....
so far so good after 1 month!
This laptop is pretty good. I can play my games with high graphics. The only thing that I found wrong was the audio system. It's a bit distorted and the mic makes me sound demonic. The sound system was a 2014 version. Other than the bad sound this laptop is pretty good. It has everything just as described. I'm just hoping no one else has this audio issue like I am having.
I put off buying a new laptop for years and instead used an HP Notebook, which is primarily for checking email and watching Netflix. I had to upgrade though, because I needed to do more than just the basics of email and watching shows online. Several people I know use Lenovo for their businesses and after researching the specs I wanted, I decided to go with it. I've had it for a month and it works great. The only personal adjustment I had to make was the sound as this one is Dolby and the HP was DTS Studio (which was better), but other than that, I have no complaints. The AMD works just as well as Intel and I am actually able to save files on the Desktop without the HP Notebook telling me storage is less than 500mb. I do however, recommend iCloud or Google Drive as it is a good backup in the event anything happens to the laptop. This Lenovo is fast, quiet (even after hours of working online), sleek, light (compared to other laptops), and durable. Just watch out for the right Shift button as it's smaller than the one on the left. I've repeatedly hit Enter when I didn't mean to.
I really love this computer. The only reason it didn't get five stars is because the screen is smaller than I was used to. A great laptop, however!
Great for gaming
Works beautifully! I love it! Does everything I wanted and needed it for. Great machine, great price, great transaction.
mouse doesn't function well
This computer came with all the bells and whistles it specified including the 16 gb of ram. CAN'T beat the price for everything under the hood on this one.
This is a very short, initial impression review. If my opinion changes, I'll update or write a separate review. I am on the fence about this laptop...I HATE the keyboard. I have missed strokes in every single sentence. You have to put an incredible amount of pressure on the keys to register a stroke, and the keys that are struck with the pinkies are especially difficult to get a good hit. It actually feels like I am typing on one of the old manual typewriters, if anyone remembers those. I have to go back and retype sentences constantly because of the missing letters. Occasionally, I will have double strikes with the same letter being typed twice.Another thing that irritated me about this laptop was the length of time it took to load up. It is expected for a brand new laptop to have updates available - it probably sat in a box in a warehouse for months, so updates have been released since it was manufactured. But, it literally took 90 minutes for this thing to download and install all of the updates. It was quite annoying.The battery is lackluster at best. It will last around 3 hours, which I suppose is not bad, but I was hoping for more. I suppose I could get a larger cell battery.Check your warranty online. Go to the Lenovo website and register your machine. I did, and it said that the warranty had been initiated in January of 2017, which is puzzling, because I just received it on 03 September 2017. I did an online chat with a customer service specialist and was told that "this happens all the time."Perhaps the most irritating thing about this laptop, even more irritating than the keyboard that I HATE, is the connectivity to WiFi. I do not have cable, so I watch movies and videos on my smart TV. I also have my cell phone connected to my WiFi while I'm home. Neither of those devices ever drop the WiFi signal, but this laptop does. Constantly. If I put the laptop in sleep mode...or even if I just don't touch it for a while, it will disconnect. When I try to get back on the computer, I have to manually connect to WiFi. Half the time, literally, it will not connect. It will show that there is no internet access. So, I will have to go into the settings and "forget" my router, then re-register it, entering the password again. I've done this MULTIPLE times since I received the laptop on Sunday. Today, no matter what I did, it simply would not connect. So, I had to unplug my router and allow it to fully reset. The computer finally connected at that point, but it shouldn't have taken that because both my phone and TV were connected and functioning the entire time.One last note......this review began with a 3-star rating, but the more I cataloged the problems I am having, and the more I had to type on this DREADFUL keyboard, the more irritated I got. So, it's now a 2-star rating.Find a better laptop.
I am a gamer and this is NO gaming machine. I increased the turbo to the max 3.3 and FRPS maxed at 16, stutter, freezing, skipped scenes. This is not a gaming system at all. If you are looking for an inexpensive gaming laptop, this is not it. I purchased this as a more portable laptop than my ASUS w/ 64G Ram that weights 12 lbs and what a regrettable decision. My MacBook gets better FRPS than this machine does and it's 4 years old. The graphics card is junk and the screen is pixelated with outlined and bright around avatars and terrains. Do yourself a favor and save a little more cash and purchase a computer worth your hard earned money. The plastic casing and small fan also makes the fan run non-stop at running barely any low level game such as MineCraft, for example. I give this a - - - star actually as it took almost a whole minute to even open up a word document. Returning after trying to increase capabilities with no avail. Those leaving high end reviews, must never have had a decent laptop if they think this is actually a gaming machine.
I love, love, LOVE this laptop! Been using nearly every day for a couple months now. It's honestly been the best laptop I've ever owned and I've had several "high end" laptops in the past that had all kinds of bugs and wonky problems that couldn't be fixed or worked around. This, laptop, though, has out-performed even my best CPU's in functionality, power, and speed! I love that the laptop is VERY quick to start up.. No waiting 10 minutes for it to boot up - more like a minute and a half. Likewise, Windows homescreen is loaded within two minutes or less of signing in... my past laptops took at least five minutes - usually more - to get everything loaded so that I could actually use it. With this laptop, I can shut it and when I open it again, it pulls out of sleep mode instantly! My past laptops would just stay frozen in a sleep state if I ever closed the laptop while it was active/in use... which really sucked considering I have three kids under five that LOVE to shut my laptop when they walk by. Everything about the laptop is fast, really. It doesn't really get hot or overheated, which was another big problem I've had with past laptops... In fact, it's never even gotten warm enough on my lap for me to want to set it on a table or elsewhere from discomfort. It is extremely quiet and I really don't hear it running unless there is a CD/DVD in and the optical drive is in motion.The ONLY thing I have noticed that may potentially be a drawback is something that might not even be the laptop's fault. On multiple occasions, I've found that after 9 or 10PM the internet would suddenly stop working. I could see all kinds of wifi networks but it would always just say "unable to connect" to any of them regardless of right password and other devices working just fine on the same wifi network... However, I recently went into my settings and chose to more or less 'reset to default' my network settings and since then, haven't had a single problem. So, I wouldn't even consider that a notch against, considering that resetting that one thing has worked just fine... it was probably just a very random error that, clearly, was easily able to be fixed without any sort of outside help or costly service/repair fees. =)I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone who is a student, does office-type work from home, or just the occasional light user. I have not tried playing video games or anything of that sort (apart from old DOS/NES games you can find to play online), so I can't really say how well it would do for a gamer.
Bought this in July 2017. Motherboard broke in about 9 months, laptop is completely dead. Manufacture's warranty already expired because its an older product. Watch out for duds.
Great for budget gaming. Runs Gta 5 on medium settings and Skyrim on high settings. It was listed as used but id be surprised if it was even "used" for an unboxing video.
Froze up constantly after the 1st day, sending back.
It's not as fast as it's expected to be, but it's ok. Thank you!
Runs WOW nice 50 to 60 fps drops some in raids. Very nice for the money
Not as fast processir as I expected but still good overall.
Great for the price. Fairly fast and supports 2 external monitors allowing 3 independent screen views. Definitely will recommend for a home office or a student setup.
my kid needed a laptop that plays minecraft and some other games and it has exceeded our expectations. Very nice laptop for the money
It really has 16gb of ram. Can run Star Wars: The Old Republic on high settings without any problem. Highly recommended and worth its price.
Great met all my needs.
Is a nice powerful computer just what I need and super easy to set up
Great laptop. Not a single issue. Upgraded wifi card cost $30ish otherwise havent changed a thing.
For a computer that is supposed to have 16 gb of ram this thing lags and all my programs freeze up one at a time randomly and I have to task manage them to shut it down and reopen it. Very poor product. Technical support not much better. there was a problem with the numbers pad it kept acting like the mouse. and tech help could do nothing to solve the problem. I finally figured it out my self while waiting ten minutes for the girl in the Philippines to ask how to solve the mystery when all it was is a easy access setting found in the control panel. so frustrated my mom bought one and no issues I decide to take the leap to Lenovo and now I regret it. Also my warranty was out dated the same day I bought it I had to send proof of purchase and Lenovo still has not replied to let me know if the warranty has been updated yet.
Very good upgrade for my older HP laptops.
Love the computer, but the mic is horrible and every mic I plug in sounds terrible
Great starter computer
I would not recommend this product. The computer works fine, however, the track pad goes wild often.
So far so good. It came as expected. Don't like that it shows fingerprints as much as it does, and the keyboard is a bit low profile for my taste, but really, that's the worst I have to say about it. The specs are awesome for a laptop for this price. I will update as I have more information. We are ordering another one though.
I did my research and took expert recommendations and I loathe this machine. It's glitchy and slow. The keyboard isn't responsive (or my typing is somehow different on this machine than all others). It's too late for a return, but I want to be sure to warn others. I've tried looking online for help and cleared out the start menu. There was a small improvement, but not enough. Buyer beware.I'm following up with Lenovo support and they are going to perform a system reset, but cannot refund my money since it was an Amazon purchase (which is fair). The Amazon windows for returns and/or product support has closed. I may end up with the world's most expensive photo album.
Great comp som loves it
I have had mine for a little over 4 months and love it. I play World of Warcraft on it no problem. No problems with sound. The only time I see lag is on 40 man raids. I use for evrry day work and it works like a charm. And great price.
warped new out of box....
Not impressed with this product. I bought this laptop to replace my old HP desk top with Windows Vista operating system. I was sure my old PC was ready to crash. It was moving very slow, and would "freeze up" frequently. I expected the new laptop to move quickly and smoothly through tasks. However, it has been as slow as my 15 year old PC. It locks up/freezes up frequently, requiring a hard reboot to get going again. This is very frustrating and happens whether working on or offline, so it's not my internet connection. I also do not like the keyboard.
This is a great product,with great specs at a great price point!
I love this computer. The keyboard action is excellent. The speed is top notch. It came with a DVDRW which was not in the ad and is a great added bonus. Don't need and HP or Mac when you can get this nice of a computer for 2/3 the cost.
I bought this laptop to use while my HP desktop is in the shop,-- it doesn't work with Verizon FIOS. This laptop works great with it! No dropping the signal, no unnecessary third-party software. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would buy it again.
Great laptop! Plenty of memory, loads pages quickly and was easy to set up and add my printer. Planned to buy a tower with monitor and keyboard, but this fits my needs much better. Light weight and has a DVD player too.
I like the computer, but the battery life on it is not as described. It doesn't last long at all and I constantly recharge it. For example, I charged to 100% and less than an hour later it was already at 56%. I'm thinking the battery is defective and was instructed from the seller to contact Lenovo directly. Other than that the laptop works well. I probably don't use it to its full potential as I am just using it for school. I gave it three stars because of the battery.
Easy set up right out of the box. No problems with connecting to internet. I had a few programs, that I use for my business, that were easy to install from each website once logged in. I spent more time customizing my settings the way I'm used to than anything but now all great. As to specs, I can't necessarily comment because as long as it works, I'm good.:) I use this for business so was looking for the best value with most capacity, etc. I'm not a gamer. Thus far, seems to run efficiently and smoothly. Will update if any problems.
Listed as a 3.3 GHz processor but only 2.1GHz when I pull up system info. The ram is 16 but DDR3 and not DDR4 but still good performance. Its very sleek and a good size for a laptop.
The Pros: It comes well-packaged. Setup is easy, though it takes time It seems to be made of good materialsThe Cons: It ran abysmally slow until I went into settings and manually had Windows 10 index all the files The keyboard layout could be better, with better placement of the arrow keys The keyboard is of poor quality. I'm a touch typist, and sometimes I have to hit a key twice to get it to register The function keys are poorly labeled Even after indexing, it seems to run slower than I would expect of a gaming laptop The screen resolution should be higher for the price
The photo happens to me every time, I think it is the processor but I really do not know. In the photo it leaves as the screen remains
Beautiful laptop with amazing specs. Two of the small details that really help set this laptop apart from others are that the keyboard is very quiet while typing and that it's Signature Edition. Knowing that this laptop came out of the box with no junkware or 3rd party trialware, already bogging it down, was such a relief. Ended up being very quick, and painless getting the laptop set up with all of my preferences.
keeps crashing saying thread stuck in driver did this at the beginning when I received it then it's been doing it much more often the longer I have it other than that for the price not to bad eats the battery fast like within 10 minutes of just checking email. Wouldn't recommend buying
Sent it back. The computer was not what it was advertised to be.
Everything we needed for our buisness
Touchpad is defective. Cursor jumps around, clicks on icons. Don't recommend using.
It doesn't start up ... don't buy this
So far it is good
I purchased this computer end of February. Very happy with the appearance and size. I admit I haven't used it much because I have another Lenovo laptop I use for work that I use the most. I purchased this one because I needed a personal computer, BUT it is so incredibly slow it's almost impossible to use. It takes forever to load start screen then once that's open im lucky if i can get the browser up. I'm very disappointed since he has more features than my other Lenovo that is 2 years old and has alot of docs and programs stored on it. I have nothing stored on the new one and im ready to throw it out the window. I cant even imagine trying to play a game on it as advertised! I only wish I would have tried using it when I first bought it because I would have returned it the first week of dealing with this!
Please, do not order this computer. I ordered one and within a few days it started freezing up sporadically. I returned it and got a new one. About 5 months later, this laptop now has a failed charging circuit on the motherboard rendering it totally useless. I now have to replace the motherboard in order to use this. This is within 5 months of ordering a new laptop! I cannot return it any longer and I did not get a warranty, I suppose it's too much to ask to have a new computer work for longer than 5 months.DO NOT ORDER THIS!
Good laptop for the price.I dont like the mouse pad, but its ok for me.
The product is very good and the service was excellent.
0 (ZERO) stars. Nothing but the Blue Screen of Death from I powered it on. Serious harddrive problems. Seeking a refund. DO NOT PURCHASE
Had faulty drives upon the initial boot. Blue screen of death. Basically got a bugged system. Not cool.
What a flop! I bought this for my daughter for Christmas since she decided to go back to college. I bought this in November, gave it to her on Christmas, and the monitor was dead by January. Reached out to Lenovo to get warranty work done as this laptop comes with a 1 year warranty only to have the service tickets cancelled without notice.The computer and the customer service both STINK!
This laptop is just terrible i've literally had it for only 3 days and i have so much to say about first off the laptop randomly freezes a lot second the sound quality is TERRIBLE i tired updating the drivers but it still sucks the headphone jacks quality is even worse it makes my 300$ headphones sound like i bought them at dollar tree and now just a few minutes ago im getting this really small but noticeable glitch line across the top of my screen. I wouldn't recommend this laptop to anyone the price is too high for the crap that i got ill definitely be returning this trash
Love it.
Received the laptop checked everything on it so far it is great just a reminder you must have knowledge about computers it has a few things you have to go thru and update and sign on if your DVD player is not working and it keeps telling you to go to app store down load Kodi from app store then your dvd will play or find a tech geek to help you. Because it only comes with standard apps but it's a great laptop.
This laptop is an excellent machine for gaming, I just have bought more when it was at the lower price.
When I first power on the computer, it's ALREADY LOCKED with ANOTHER USER, PLUS IT ASKS FOR YOUR LOCATION. Have to return the laptop asap.Beware of this product ! ! !
I ordered mine refurbished (Like-New) and might I say im quite impressed. Fast, no bloatware and beautiful sleek design. Only thing I didn't like was the ups gal leaves my package on the porch. Thank god I was pulling in as she were pulling out... That totally came out wrong. Ill update
Very disappointed with this product. This is supposed to be a new, signature addition laptop, but I have had nothing but trouble with it. I have the highest McAfee protection on it, I run multiple scans, and I don't download anything funky. There is no excuse for this why this shouldn't be top notch! It is so slow and it constantly lags...not happy. I have the highest internet that Cox Communications provides and I'm STILL getting a "not responding" message at the top of my search engine.
Lenovo is a reliable product but the laptop I received would not boot up. Called technical support walked me through a set up but computer crashed. Returning product
Couldn't even use this for more than 10 minutes. It started crashing and was always showing BSOD. The novo button was't working at all. Spent over 40 minutes on the phone with Lenovo Support yet nothing could get this crap laptop working fine. I have to return it. This is a second bitter experience with Lenovo after their Y700 turned out to also be a useless laptop for me in 1 week. I am done please.
No complaints at all, sure wish I would have bought one earlier. Easy to use, great quality.
Its Pretty good laptop but the battery suck..5hrs my ass more like 2 and less if you have your screen brightness youll see maybe an hour ...out side of that i would recommend it i can run protools /Vdj other studio programs with no lag.adobe Premier Pro Runs pretty good as well.
was exactly what i expected.
I love this laptop. It is really nice and everything I expected it to be. I haven't had any problems with it thus far and I am thinking about getting another one for my son.
I am trying to get rid of mine already. This thing is slower than a snail in molasses going uphill against the wind.I REGRET BUYING THIS PILE OF JUNK!!!Been using Lenovo now for a while - this one is NOT a winner by any means...even at this price-point.
Bought two of these for my teenage daughters for Christmas. They LOVE them! I did purchase an extra 1TB hard drive (also from Amazon of course) for each since they only come with 128GB SSD. They boot up in 10 seconds with the solid state drive which is why I purchased them. I see no reason to pay more for a larger SSD when I can easily add a 1TB drive for $50.I do wish Dell would follow other manufacturers and add a simple compartment on the bottom for upgrading the hard drive and RAM. Instead they cover one screw with the service tag requiring you to pierce it to take the bottom off. I find that to be a horrible business practice. Hey Dell, the 90's are over and people want to upgrade their laptops themselves without paying some overpriced "service tech". I guess the threat is that it will void the warranty. Well not in my state.And they wonder why they're losing market share.But even with that terrible corporate Big Brother mentality, it's not worth knocking off a whole star for it.
Really fast little laptop! Thanks to the SSD!
This computer has had issues since the day I bought it. The technical support is with techs whom I can barely understand. They want me to send it to them and it could take 5-12 business days. I will never buy another Dell computer.
Excelente producto. Recomendado.
In my opinion this is a great laptop. Did a lot of research and a lot of people complained that it ran very slow.There was A LOT of bloatware on this laptop. Delete all dell applications, and anything else you might not use it for. Took about 30 minutes and now this things is firing on all cylinders! Great for what I needed it for
Seems like a great unit have always liked Dell. The power plug is smaller than my older units, but I expect great durability. Bought this to replace my work laptop which died after 5 years of abuse! This is my third Dell I expect it last just as long. Has touch screen which doesn't seem to sensitive, the whole thing is very lite and has mosterous storage capacity. 2 freaking Terabytes! I've already had it grinding away for a few hours transfer a couple hundred gigs of data! The other reviews say its slow I have not noticed that, but DELL did install alot of crap that I don't use mostly antivirus and support programs. Great laptop at a great price !
Straight out of the box looks nice great features. Runs slower than expected. Before I connected to the internet for the first time it was running slow. After I hooked it up and did all the suggested updates still muchslower than my old laptop that only had 1gb of RAM. The wireless card doesn't support 5g and is constabtly having connection issues with various routers. It would've been great to know that it had outdated hardware before purchasing.
It is built very flimsy.The evident build quality is obviously poor.Like other reviewers noted, it comes loaded with all kinds of bloatware, and with an old version of Windows 10.It took about a day of downloading Windows 10 updates before I was even allowed to see the system and hard drive, in order to verify it was the computer I ordered. Then there was another day of cleaning out the Dellware. BTW, forget it if you do not connect to the internet by cable. The WiFi Windows 10 update did not work at all.I suppose if the cost of the computer is cheaper due to the bloatware, you could make arguments that it is OK. But if you want to just buy a computer and use it right away, don't get this thing.For instance, it comes with McAfee antivirus. It only took two days before I was getting pop ups for an expensive monthly subscription to McAfee, or "be unprotected". It took me quite a while to figure out how to remove McAfee and start up the free Windows Defender.Even after a lot of effort on my part, the computer is still infected with Dell software, and I expect I will never quite delete all of it. Little windows keep popping up asking me how I feel about Dell service, for instance. It is very difficult to know which program from Dell is needed for something essential like mouse support, and which one is basically Dell spyware.The hardware side of things is no picnic.The thing re-boots itself once or twice a day for no apparent reason, and then starts up YouTube and plays the last YouTube video I have watched. So in the middle of the night YouTube starts playing, and I have to unlock the screen in order to turn it off.After it self re-boots the touch screen feature often will not function. A re-boot will not bring back the touch screen, but so far a complete shut down and re-start will fix it.The touch screen, when it does function, feels crude.The speed of the computer is adequate for the price. And the screen viewing angle is also adequate.But the case and keyboard feel like a cheap disposable toy.Obviously, I cannot recommend this, but I am lost as to what else I might choose. From what I can see, the other manufacturers are all just as cheesy.Good luck!Update - after 3 or so weeks. The computer has been stable and works as it should. The initial setup was a grind. But it has not re-booted itself for the last 3 weeks, and the touchscreen is functioning.
I do not work for Dell but computers are my business. This is a very good laptop for the price. At this price do not expect a gaming machine but expect a stable computer to surf the web, email and play some videos. Other reviewers tend to think that you should be able to play the newest games on ultra high settings for about $400.00 There is a reason there are still $2000.00+ laptops out there.
Within three weeks of receiving the laptop, it started to go through the dell testing upon booting it up. This is over a seven hour process. When it was almost done it would freeze within the process. I would have to restart it and start all over again. If I had it longer I would send it in for repairs, but I've only had it three weeks so I'm just going to return it. Will be purchasing an Asus or Lenovo in the future.
Unfortunately received an older model Dell Inspiron (NOT 2018), non-touchscreen (ordered touchscreen), and only 256G SSD (ordered 2T). Hopefully this was and oversight and not intentionality sent to bait and switch a novice computer purchaser. Disappointed.
SLOW! I just upgraded my internet connection to gigabit service and this Dell only downloads about 40 Mbs while the Windows 10 Lenovo I have 3which is supposedly not as strong because it is two years old downloads through my Wifi at over 500 Mbs, Wired at about 700Mbs. The screen touch lags and the computer itself is over-all slow. It's a shame because Amazon Trusted logo was present when I purchased it but no longer appears on the page.
Complete and total waste of resources. Processing and hard drive speed are abysmally slow. Dell has refused to accept it as a Return so we have been burning time shipping it back and forth to Dell. They have sent out a tech to repair, no better. Stop offering to send Techs to fix this product. After three attempts to fix it, admit you shipped a DUD of a product and REPLACE it. For the amount of time they have invested, they would have been better off financially replacing or refunding.I had never purchased a Dell before and now know that DELL has a terrible product and terrible service.
this thing quit working on my son exactly 36hrs after the return/support timetable. It was delivered 12/7 but of course wasn't opened until Christmas day. So, my son has used it for all of 47 days. Of course, the pin key and owners manual are no where to be found. Would love to exchange this for a new one given the circumstances.
Bought this for my brother who just started college (2017), this is a good alternative to an expensive gaming or two in one laptop. It does run slow at first with updates and bloatware but once removed this is a very good deal for the amount of storage, ram etc. if youâre looking for something for gaming or anything to do with media I would suggest something else, but if you need something for writing, excel and simple computing tasks this is a great option
Little slower than I would have expected, but once you take the bloatware off the speed picks up considerably. The set up took 2 hours which is obnoxiously long and tell you the truth quite annoying. I usually buy ASUS products and will probably go back there for my next purchase. It is also feels cheaply made.It is ok, nothing special..
I was skeptical at first but this computer is amazing! I had a prior Dell Inspirion and this is replacing it. I got many good years out of that computer. This computer was slow at first but I automatically went and removed all the bloatware of it, now it is blazing fast! I love the touchscreen and size of the screen. Overall, this computer has been great! I hope it lasts as long as my last Inspirion.. Great job Dell!Update after 3 months: Canât complain with it at all, it has run fantastic after disabling all the bloatware and windows 10 services!
laptop performs well. I've even used it as portable game capture machine, which from specs it should really suck at. The problem is the case and keyboard. Horrible. The pictures do not do it justice. This is the cheapest feeling laptop I've ever dealt with. Keyboard is mushy. I was excited when I ordered but immediately regretted it when the wife opened the box. Again though, it's been a solid machine otherwise. Good for anywhere you need cheap function over form. Just set your other expectations really low.
I had given up on PC after the Windows 8 nightmare. Iâm about the fourth work day that was wasted trying to deal with that ridiculousness I left the office, went straight to a computer store, and bought a MacBook Air out of sheer rage. Never had a moment of trouble with it and swore I would never buy another PC. Recently I hired an assistant who has never used a Mac, and I didnât want to spend Mac money, so I bought this for her. Itâs been perfect so far. Iâm no tech expert but I know a crappy computer when I see one, and this is not one of them. I was using iCloud but needed to switch to OneDrive because I donât want my assistant in my personal photos, etc. Now Iâm planning to buy a second one for myself since the MacBook Air makes it hard for me to use OneDrive. Itâs cool that it has a touch screen too. I didnât think I would care about that but itâs handy every once in a while.
After the nightmare of going thru the many updates which bogs the machine down upon unboxing I have found this laptop to be fast, efficient and solidly built. Just be patient in the first 24hrs. and you will be rewarded with a great little laptop.
Less than 6 months and the Hard Drive is going bad. Dell is sending me a box to send it to them to fix. I'm a little leery about sending it but they're doing for no cost.. I scanned the QR code and it said HD failure. I checked the description from Amazon-it's not matching what Tech is saying.. I hope Dell will bring this machine to the specifications that I bought. It only failed long after Amazon could intervene.
I can say that I become a little bit disappointed when started using the notebook. I really thought that an I5 with 8Gb would be much faster. Maybe Windows 10 demand a lot of memory. Was necessary google for some tutorial that could help me to how to optimize the configuration. Add some more memory would be the second alternative but it would cost some money that is not available at this moment.
Sometimes I have to press the number key twice.... not sure if it's the laptop just being slow..... or the key pad needs to be more sensitive....Or is this computer really new or "not with pre installed malware" recording what I type........ When it decides to act right, it's ok for light use.
Excellent. Coordinated well with iPhones.
Itâs a dell and so far itâs been good but the track pad acts a bit weird at times and gets a bit un responsive. It will probably get fixed with a update.
Everything works on this Windows-10 laptop- I just wish that Dell had included a 'disk-busy' LED to see when the PC is 'working'.. Other than that I'm very pleased with the touchscreen laptop's operation.
Seems a little slow, I read a review that said it's processor was fast, but right outa the box it seemed sluggish.
I am not sure how many star rating to give... My take on the product is, it has a good configuration and the pics look very good. The actual product is not as good looking, the plastic used is very cheap and looks very fragile. Keypad is not handy and in my case few keys are functioning reversely like @ is actually printing " .Overall, I am giving 3 star since Dell is reputed to give a sturdy laptop but this looks very fragile and seems like needs to be handled delicately.
Computer is ok. Feels cheap plastic but nice having a huge touchscreen and a large keyboard. Took over 9 hours to download initial Windows update but for basic usage it's going to be ok I hope.
Setup was easy. Performs well right out of the box. Would like to have known if the RAM was expandable. Nothing in the Dell or Microsoft software would tell me.
I liked it when it worked. It is now dead. What do I do?? This has never happened with over 25 years of owning several Dell desktops.
This computer was for my boyfriend and he is super happy about the size of the screen and the touchscreen capability. He works very well. I'd buy again.
received it on time, it runs good and after removing some bloatware it ran much faster, color and sound could be much better as the color looks washed out and sound could be louder.
Works pretty well, took 5 hours to update ugh!I also uninstalled a lot of things that made it slow from the beginning now it's very fast.The fan is medium noise sometimes and than very quiet.The only thing is Skype. I think this laptop dont take in light well.I may have to play with the camera settings. Because in the morning with plenty light it shows very clear to the person I'm skyping with, more detailed he says.But at night with all the lights turned off ,you can only see my face if you turn on the brightness at full power. May have to call Dell about that. Because my old laptop I could use the light from the person I'm talking to would highlight my face very well without turning up my brightnessManages to hold a charge for about 4-5 hours. Also when turned off I still save battery.Very light which is good and awesome that is has a touchscreen which I most likely won't use much because I don't want handprints on my screen. The sound is very good because the speakers is actually at the bottom, but can still hear clearly.I'll update in about two weeks to make sure this laptop works perfectly.Also I do not use this laptop for gaming. It's primarily for Skype and watching kdrama, anime,and other tv show purposes.Update: 2/9/18For a brand new laptop I had to send it to dell for repair because the Fan needed replacing. There was a cinstantvticking noise. I'm returning because I should not be sending a brand new Laptop for repairs.
It's ok for the storage + price and features, but living in this generation, it should be a bit better, power button should have a led light at least, but this laptop looks to numb.5 years ago I had an dell and was better than this one except this on has a touch screen and storage.
I've already had tons of issues with this computer, in only six months. I won't buy another Dell.
My husband is not a "tech" type of guy but he really wanted to learn how to use a computer. We got his this laptop and he has not left it alone! He is surfing the web, sending emails and using MS Office. Thank you for making such an intuitive laptop.
I am happy with my Laptop! I am not having any problems getting to where I want to go!
Nice laptop, does everything I need it to do while away from my office.
Love my new computer! Works perfectly and does everything I needed it to do.
works great
Keyboard feels cheap, also there are no power lights so you don't know if it's on or off. Good speed for the average user.
Arrived safely. Been using it everyday with no issues. Using for audio editing as well without issue.
The delivery was good, but when i openned the box i realized that the power plug was not in the box, so I can't use the computer because i can't connect it to a power supply.
Son says it's great
My rating is low because the power button works intermittently. Sometimes the PC turns on and sometimes it doesn't. I tried tapping the button lightly once, twice, three times and also holding the button, nothing works all the time. I do not want a PC that turns on some of the time so I'm returning it.
Not as much bloatware as I assumed would be on it, it actually is a good deal and works well. Easy to set up [Cotana starts yammering upon plugging it in] and just as easy to remove all the unnecessary junk and run faster. Happy with it overall and would recommend to others.
Best laptop yet!!!
My son just go this model as a gift and after about 3 days it gave the blue screen of death it wont boot into windows so we are going to return it for another one.
Great value!
I purchased this computer in January and so far it has been great. My other laptop was 0 years old and way too slow. This one is great for what I need it for. I am very glad I found this one and purchased it.
mid range model with high capacity hard disk it serves my purposes in an excellent wayhighly recommended for the reasonable price
just what I needed
Finiky. Does not always connect to wifi. Other than that it is a great machine.
It is easy to use, light, tin and handy.
nice product and useful for my kids for their activities
I had to disabled the touch screen because neither my finger (6 ring size) and the stylus kept hitting the wrong things. If you get this computer, I recommend buying a mouse for it.
Very Good product. It would be amazing if it has USB 3.0 and Dual Band WIFI. It doesn't have AC band.
It took a day or so to get used to it, but I love it now. It's working well. I love the touch screen feature.
I bought the laptop 3 months ago and does not work anymore.
very good, very trustworthy and comfortable. love it
Great deal!
I love the price with great features.
Pretty Nice computer. It's fast and confortable.
Enjoying it
I like very much how it work.
Excellent laptop and hard disk capacity for the price.
system is going on and off.. not sure why it is.. Also it is very slow
Battery lasts 3 h. Announcement says average 5 h. It doesnât work so fine for the configuration it says it has.
Pretty sweet
Extremely extremely slowHangs a lot. I've had 4 gb ram systems that are much faster.
Very nice!
It's ok, it's working well. But the only thing is the soft grinding noise from maybe HDD or the fan
Everything is good except I am having a problem with the audio which I have contacted Dell about.
excellent product!
I really liked how light it is
But it everything else is perfect. The touchscreen and the Bluetooth work excellent.
It's nice and light
Equipment received in excellent conditions
A 2TB laptop and perfect for streaming and gaming
Really good but just kind of slow
It was awesome and everything is working great till now.
Great but the battery run out fast
PLEASE PLEASE STAY AWAY.... this was hell! After a 4 days the computer stop working and I lost all of my files I finally spoke to Dell and they advised that the computer was 165 days old. Not what I would call new.
Great laptop!
Gets the job done.
This was a Christmas gift. And she was excited to get it.
Trying to get used to the touch screen and keyboard. The one thing I am just not comfortable with is the touchpad. I am going to try to cover the left/right button so my accidental finger on them does not confuse the computer. What I like most is that it supports miracast, so I can utilize the TV to help me see the information I need for trading stocks.
Crashed within hours of setup. Won't load past the dell screen.Update: So, a lot of googling got my computer to load. It worked for 3 whole months, but then when I turned it on, I got a no bootable devices found error. Again to google for help; apparently this is a pretty common problem (as was the last problem - so many common problems....). So I watched the videos and red the dell help support essays (which always start with "turn it off and on again"), and attempted the recommended fixes and became familiar with all the terms and menus and, gosh, did none of that fix the problem. So. Here we are again, but of course it's too late to return in now.... So a new hard drive is in order. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to buy this pos.
I run a small family business from home, and without a laptop, I'm dead in the water. My Toshiba has been slowly dying for the last few weeks, and is now on it's last leg. Great computer, but I needed another one, and fast. Boss just purchased a new laptop herself and suggested the Dell Inspiron. She said she "loves it".Dell Inspiron purchased, with expedited shipping. I was thrilled to receive it before 10am just two days after ordering. During setup, I noticed something I've never seen: extremely loud beeps (enough to get the entire household to ask what was going on), accompanied by error codes. All codes stated there is no hard drive. WTH???? It then popped up with a QR Code to scan, which took me to Dell's website. Yep. Dell themselves backed it up. "No hard drive". They were nice enough to offer to ship an external hard drive to me, free of any charges. That doesn't work on my end. Ever spend a lot of time on the road? Traveling with extra gear really bogs you down, and if they were sending me one to install myself that wouldn't be external? Yeah no.End result: Have spoken to Staples. Taking my old, kind of still working, laptop in this afternoon, buying another one, and calling the seller of the hunk of plastic that arrived today to come pick it up and give me a full refund. Also note, this is the first Dell I've ever purchased, and it will be the last.
Took two 8 hour windows 10 update and still says something went wrong with update.
I love it. It has plenty of memory and works well for what I need. However, it was left on the doorstep, they didn't even knock. I was disappointed with that, but otherwise, it's great!
HDD ran @ 100% right out of the box and the laptop runs really slow.
So far so good. I bought this model after my Acer's hard drive kept dying and eventually wouldn't boot. Had all the features I wanted from a DVD drive to ethernet port, 3 USB ports (2 3.0 ports), 1 HDMI port, 1 SD card slot and touch screen (no backlit keyboard). Has 8GB memory and 2T drive with more enough storage. Speed seems okay...not super, but it will do for what I use it for. Has some Dell apps on it I haven't used and probably won't. Overall it seems pretty versatile with ample connectivity and storage for the price. Can't judge reliability yet because I've only had it a couple of weeks or so, but Dell ranked reasonably on reliability by the various tech reviewers out there. So far it's working for me!
This was a Christmas present for my daughter. Her first laptop was a Dell she used in college. She was thrilled to get the new upgraded computer for her power point presentations and demonstrations. Itâs fast enough to handle her needs
THIS HAS THE SLOWEST PROCESSOR EVER!! my friend for your convenience do not buy this!!! you can get grow in old till this open up every time after freezing because its freeze every time im i return to it i need to do a restartTO DEAR SELLER.. please do not fool people because you want to get rich stop selling this stupid laptops with cheap processor!!!
Constantly freezing up! Extremely slow! Can't upload photos! Forever telling me "this website cannot be found". Bought it brand new a month ago and I am ready to toss it off my second story deck! HATE IT!!!!!
Window crashed twice at first week, over heating the CPU also freezes the running, return after 7 days
Horrible computer. Very slow!!!! Refunded and bought a better one at Best Buy
So far so good!!i have it for a almost a week and i like the keypad
Very sleek and light weight
It is great but can not fold.
in love
I received the wrong laptop!!!
The laptop is way too heavy too travel with.
It's a good laptop at this price
INSANE! This is the 21st Century, isn't it? Dell and Amazon.com should be ashamed (yes you Amazon.com) for promoting such terrible products. The laptop is fine, I mean its a computer but what annoyed me is that I had to keep checking on the thing for almost 5 hours as it updated . . .?! If the computer is new, shouldn't the operating system and necessary programmes be up to date? Consumers only experience this inconvenience after the fact and are forced to tolerate it. SHAME on Dell and SHAME on Amazon.com!!!
This is not an original Dell! I should have known better! VERY slow, no codes for Excel and Microsoft Word! If I didnât already have personal information on it I would most definitely return it!!! ORDER from Dell direct do not make the same mistake I did!!!
A great laptop, especially it has 2TB HD, love it!
One thing you should be aware of which is a general problem with Dell laptops: it is possible that after you've had it for a while, the laptop will stop registering that the power supply is connected. It will show a "plugged in, not charging" sign instead of "plugged in, charging." The main issue with this (other than the fact that the battery will not charge) is that it causes the laptop to respond by slowing everything down to the point where it's nearly unusable and definitely frustrating. (Think an in interval of several minutes between when you click something and when the action happens). When this happened to me I read all about it online in hopes of finding a solution, but apparently the solution is with the mechanical prongs that sit within the structure of the jack. What I took home from everything I read is that if this problem happens, then it pretty much means that it's time to stop using the laptop and to get a new one. Granted, for me it happened after a few years, so if you think you'll be okay with buying a new laptop after 3-4 years then this may not be an issue for you-- but I do think that this is something you should take into consideration ahead of time. I should note that the Dell laptop I had was not a $600 one, it was much pricier than that, so it wasn't a consequence of it being cheap; you might be lucky and never run into this problem, but I think you ought to be aware that this is a general problem for Dell laptops (you can look this up online and read more about it).
I have been an ASUS user for many years and there are still two in the house - my wife's 15.6" and my old 13". In my search I found that Dell offered more features for dollars spent. No issues right out of the box :) The setup took just a few minutes. However, the Windows 10 Home updates along with a few hardware and BIOS update took HOURS. OK ... just have some patience. Once that was done, I ran the Dell SupportAssist which took only a few minutes. The keyboard has a nice feel and is responsive. The touchpad isn't quite as sensitive as my ASUS, but more than acceptable. There were professional reviews that the touchscreen was not up to par. I find no lack of response. The fan is very quiet and unit seems to be running very cool, an issue I had with my ASUS.The case feels a bit "plastic" which it is of course, and has a rough texture, which if you want to skin it, you may have an issue. A nice feature is that you don't have to remove the back if you need to replace the battery. An issue with my ASUS which is one reason for a new system, - batteries lasted less than a year. Not sure what life expectancy will be here - hopefully much better. It has a fair use time of 5 hours, which with the ability to replace the battery without removing the back is a big plus if you have need to be hours without AC.It has a more than adequate HD at 2tb, and RAM at 8gb (upgradeable). The i5 7200u processor is not the fastest on the market, but at this price point is a great value. This is not a gamers system, but I understand that it can do a fair job with many games. Keep in mind that this is a NEW unit, not a refurbished. There were a lot of refurb with less features for the same dollars and more.The seller, Trivalley, has the best rating of any Dell and HP laptop sellers on Amazon. They were a few dollars more than other sellers, but their customer service before the sale was excellent. I contacted them 6-8 times via email with various questions which were all answered promptly and completely.All in all ... Super pleased with the Seller, the laptop, and Amazon.EDIT: There is an issue with warranty. The Dell SupportAssist app installed shows that the warranty expires on 12/23/1018 even though it wasn't purchased until 2/14/2018. Called Dell and they said it was an Amazon issue and to contact them to make the correction. Guess what? Amazon said it was Dell's problem. Called and Chatted (both) with Dell and they said that they would not honor the one year warranty. Reason: the warranty starts when the unit leaves the warehouse since it was on a bulk purchase. REALLY? Contacted the Amazon Seller, Trivalley and they said that they would provide the 1 year warranty. Doesn't sound like a fair deal to me, but grateful for the coverage. Dell has probably lost a future customer even though this is a very nice laptop (see review above). If there were a rating here just for Dell, I would give them a one or two.Additionally, I contacted Dell today regarding the HD being encrypted and unable to partition. Took two chats to resolve this. No help from the first other than a phone number. Called and this tech wanted my life history before helping even though he had my system information.He was a bit irritating and I told him I was going to hang-up and try later. I did a chat again. This chat tech was even willing to do a remote to help out. I didn't have the time for that - so the email route. I got all the information I needed and all is well.
This laptop is slow! My laptop from 6 years ago still runs fast that this Laptop. I was told that the processor on the Inspiron 15 was fast and stable It's not!!!!. I pray that I can exchange this laptop.
Disappearing customer support, hung up on, got "we're closed" message when I called back on my phone but they were open for business minute later when my sister called from her phone. When gave my info again they hung up again.
My last laptop was a Dell that ran solidly for over eight years. I have had this one for a bit over a year and it's been problem after problem. I am looking at having to replace the screen entirely shortly-- the touchscreen started malfunctioning and making the computer unusable after about six months until I disabled it. Now the screen has started flickering and if my computer falls asleep, I have to reboot it because it wakes up with a blank white screen. On top of everything, it's run very slow from day one, fresh out of the box. It's got a great price, but keep looking. This is not a quality machine.
The seller lied, It was not the 2018 model, did not have the 2TB hard drive, and did not have touchscreen capabilities. As such i am returning this product.
I didn't buy this from Amazon but from Best Buy. First, don't buy from Dell. After tech support fails 3 times to fix problems, they slow walk replacement. This fact alone should be disqualifying.As to the machine, eliminating bloatware is not enough. Either touchpad and/or touchscreen fail, necessitating a reboot. Windows loads slowly if you're lucky. Sometimes you get the BSOD. I have owned 3 Dells, but this is the last. I see no commitment to quality and inefficient unhelpful third world tech support.Good picture and sound quality is rendered irrelevantPre Black Friday? More likely, the Nightmare Before Xmas.
os crashed in less than 1 week. Startup takes forever even when useless programs have been removed. I am so sorry that I bought a Dell. New Buyers beware!
I bought the computer for school, and seems like it will do the job. However, I did find it weird that the computer was not factory reset when I received it. I had to do that myself when it arrived.
The laptop arrives fast and in good shape. The size and weight meet my expectation. The laptop functions smooth. Good product!
I haven't cared for HP but I figured I'd give them another try since the price was right. I bought this to use a laboratory computer abroad. A day before I leave, it comes, turns on for 5 minutes and then black screen. Charging doesn't work, dead unit.
This is SOOO not the computer pictured on Amazon. I specifically purchased this one because it had all the features that i needed, plus a number keypad on the right hand side. This one, as you can see pictured does not. I'm not satisfied with my purchase.
Specs were as described but images were not close. I was no excited about the color anyway and then I received a robin's egg blue computer. Not as pictured. No keypad as shown in the pictures. No trial to Office as described in specs. Processor, RAM, etc was all correct so I'm going to keep it, but I'm not happy about it.
very good laptop. fast delivery
I love the color, it's quick, and small enough to carry everywhere. It does not automatically come with chrome so I had to download that. The only thing that is bothering me is that it only came with a 28.6 GB drive, and that it doesn't have that much space left on it. The only thing I have downloaded was Chrome, and that did not take much. Other than that it is great.
Within a week I began having issues with this laptop, namely its "blackout flashes" I will be playing my pogo game and with every mouse click it blacks out. I restart the computer and it will work properly again. A few days ago it started the blackouts and when I restarted it the blackouts continued. I then shut it down and it took several attempts to turn it back on before it actually happened. I dread the thought of taking it in to get it looked at for fear of the repair costing more than what I initially paid for it
This laptop has been really great except that I cannot update it since I can not set up administration rights on it. The CD-ROM that came with it can not be run since the laptop does not have a CD-ROM drive. Until the notice to update, this laptop worked just fine. So, I am pretty disappointed.
I bought this computer for my son for College, it was delivered to him on August 30th. It is now December 24th and the screen decided to go out on half of the computer. What a piece of junk! I would say that this thing was basically a disposable throw away. Never again will I buy anything like this. Very disappointed and not something I needed to happen at Christmas time. Don't have the money to keep replacing computers.
Iâve only had the pc for two week, so if there are any defects I hadnât ran across them yet. The package arrived maybe 4 days before the eta and it was in perfect condition. I wouldâve never known the computer was refurbished had I not picked it myself. Iâm satisfied with my purchase and would buy from this seller again if I needed to.
This laptop was like new and packaged well. Everything works great and as advertised.
Bought this for our son for school, so far it works well.
Awesome - perfect for my son
Just a regular computer which will get your regular day to day work done. Donât expect it to be too fast or too slow either.Graphics quality is good.One of the best computers in this price range.
Order blue computer got a purple and also thought I was a new computer . Got refurbished computer don't mind that. Page didn't say that.
Exactly how itâs described and itâs a nice size with clear screen and runs pretty good
I brought it for my grandson and he loves it!
Good purchase for being a refurb but I had to get it fixed within the first week of use because it wouldn't properly update which resulted the computer in restarting constantly, slowing it down and freezing. Once I got it fixed and updated, I haven't had any issues since. I'm OK with having to get it fixed being that it was a refurb and cheap enough but was more of an inconvenience.
Perfecti recommend it
I just opened it to look at before wrapping it for Christmas gift. It is nothing like the picture. There's this huge opening towards the back. It almost looks as if it were broken. The color is not the same either. It's a lighter blue. I feel like returning it. Not worth it.
This computer reacts very slow
I cannot get my screen to work on my laptop I was told that this was a brand new laptop and found out that it was refurbished when it was sent to my house and now I need to find out how to return it because it is honestly not working at all
Not what is pictured. Knew it was too good to be true. No number keypad area, just across the top. Will be returning for a full refund.
Had to send it back due to some programming problems but bought another one exactly the same. Thanks Guys
Love the color of my new computer
No problems
granddaughter in culinary school, needed, was prettier in person than on line, wish could have been yellow her favorite, but it does the job
Excellent product
It's a good all around machine for the money. Passmark rates my machine in the 69th percentile in performance for all computers they've tested. The 12 GB memory and SSD disk speeds rate especially high, around the 75th percentile. So booting and loading apps is blazing fast. I just wish I knew more about CPUs before I purchased. This uses a 7th generation I7 processor (I-7 7500U), which rates around the 50th percentile in terms of all CPUs. Quite fast for everyday use, although it rates in the bottom third of the many flavors of Core I-7 processors. But I have some spreadsheets that use computation-intensive simulations that can really benefit from a speedy CPU. I didn't know that an 8th gen Core I-5 processor like the 8250U is actually much faster for heavy computing (I figured any I-7 CPU has to be faster than any I-5 CPU...silly me). And you can get an I-5 8250U processor for only $599 in the Acer Aspire E15 model on this site. It has only 8GB RAM, but it would've been a better fit for me...120% faster spreadsheet processing versus my old laptop instead of the 50% gain this Lenovo gives me. The Passmark website (and its free downloadable software for testing your machine) is very good for learning about different processor speeds, graphics cards and disk drives. Live and learn.
smooth like silk, cant even hear a thing from it.
Excellent laptop, powerful I7 core and loads of ram make this a serious laptop. I use mine daily and have nothing but good experiences with it.
Absolutely Perfect for Business. I am a Lawyer and I Love It. Totally Happy.
Super fast booting up but not please with battery life and screen resolution. Screen not clear to view.
As advertised. Been using for two months and have no complaints. We use Lenovo computers and work stations at my job and they seemed pretty reliable which prompted this purchase for my personal use. It's fast, light, huge screen, and it looks good.
1 month since I bought it and it doesnât start, doesnât charge and itâs completly dead. Go home Lenovo! -.-
Muy cÃ³moda
Just over a month after purchasing it, it crashed and had to do a hard reset. I produce music and lost 4 files which took over 80 hours worth of time to create. I didnât have a chance to back up within the 30- something days Iâve owned it...didnât think I needed to worry about that this soon. Lenovo wonât do anything to build my trust to continue using this and itâs too late to return via amazon.
Excellent computer!
Very happy with this laptop. It's SO pretty. It was very easy to set up ad get up and running. Had MS Office and internet in minutes.I don't mind the keyboard at all. No problems there.Video and sound are great.Only reason I knock off one star is that I don't like the touch pad. It's either over sensitive or not sensitive enough. Mouse will randomly slide across screen, have to hit the left and right tabs too hard. I ordered a mouse, and I'm sure after that it will be perfect!It is simple and streamlined. Probably wouldn't recommend for anything complex at all. But if you just want a low priced machine for word processing and basic internet, it's wonderful.
This will get the job done but don't expect anything fancy. It can be slow to boot and is beyond slow to update.
I love my new laptop! I like the size the color, the way it operates. The only thing I am a little unhappy about this laptop only has a 3 hour battery life before needing charged.
Comes with what may be the world's largest collection of bloatware. The excessive bloatware makes navigating and simple uses of productive software a chore. We feel like a time warp happened, this Ideapad yearns to be competitive with 2010-2012 laptops. A true electronic disappointment. A great example of unreasonable return limitations for devices which take time to unearth their lack of utility.
I bought this for my mom since her old computer was so slow. I thought that with the larger memory and larger storage and the fact that it is NEW - that it would be fast. It is PAINFULLY SLOW. I canât seem to find a place to ask if there is something wrong with it... I am terribly disappointed in the quality, the customer service and how slow this computer is. It also said it came with âwordâ?but turns out itâs just the 30 day trial and now I have to buy word to add to a painfully slow computer.
Terrible experience. Machine froze a few times. Had to do a complete reset. Finally froze with the start button lit up. No response from any keys. Tried to return it but Amazon wanted me to prepay the shipment internationally from Chile. It would cost 10 times of what DHL charge Amazon.Will have to settle for a local repair at my cost. And how I hate windows 10. This has a very small processor, 1 ghz about third of the size of my desktopwhich is 3ghz. For windows 10 not a good idea.Too bad! It is a handsome looking machine..
Ordered this for my mom, whose 76, as a Mother's day present. She wanted a laptop for months, but was was to nervous to buy one herself, she broke down in tears when she opened it. It was easy to set up and get going for her. There was one little issue with Windows 10 not booting up one day, so I told/showed her to hit the F5 button to get the home screen run the anti-virus and restart it again. She hasn't had any problems with it since. Can't wait to order one for myself!!
I ordered this for my mom a few months ago and she recently told me she doesn't have any sound. I looked and there isn't any software on the laptop. I contacted Amazon and they had me call the manufacture and they haven't responded to me yet.
Problems right out of the box... We had to return to the manufacturer for repairs. Never in my life, have I had to return new, anyone of the 20 computers I've purchased, for repairs. Worst experience I've every had with a computer.
I bought this computer in the middle of March did an update now I have no Arrow key I can't get to anything this computer sucks if there is someone that can contact me I don't know this is just it just malfunction computer and I could get a replacement but I'm thinking since I bought it in March and its May and I paid good money for it it should work
It's a Wonderful machine I bought it as a birthday gift and it's working perfectly.
Purchased this for. My daughter and she. Truly likes it and it's different from. Everyone elses.
It is slow but works well once it gets going.
So far I love it. Lots of memory. Itâs fast. Runs smooth.
My daughter loves her gift!
Cute but incredibly slow. Iâm kinda sad actually.
Can barely get anything done.. have to sell it.
After updating the computer it failed to restart. It is just clicking at the moment and not loading up anything. Very disappointing. I would not recommend this.
Awesome machine. Lots of space. Fast. Was worth the money.
loved the color. runs great no problems as of yet at least.but all together a great price for an everyday use laptop
it is slow and it freezes but hopefully i'll work the kinks out
VERY SLOW!
Works great....got it for business and hasn't let me down.
easy setup, great performance and value.
Consistently needs Windows updates that fail to load. Saw same computer on major website for about 80 dollars cheaper about a week later. It works... But if I could turn back time...
Doesn't do good with too many games but all in all a good laptop
I like the laptop. I'm still learning how to work with the Windows 10 but it's, all in all, a great laptop. Would recommend it to everybody.
Was as expected.
I am in the process of returning my purchase due to constant irritating running noise, not sure if it's the hard drive or the cooling fan, but it's extremely annoying, especially if you like to work in a very quiet environment. Also runs very slow. Not at all happy with it! Can't figure out why the manufacturer would even let this off the production line without solving or correcting this issue.
This is an impressive laptop thatâs worth your consideration and represents a good value for a few reasons.This is the nicest âfeelingâ?Acer product Iâve reviewed, though Iâve reviewed two other Acer computers and an Acer monitor. This seems like a premium product. The external branding is a more muted than on a lot of âgamingâ?laptops and this model will not look gaudy in a classroom or office environment. Thatâs not the case for many competitors, which look obnoxious. The red screen bezel is a muted red, more like an accent, and the only really distinction will be that sweet backlit keyboard. While you can tell this is a gaming laptop at first sight, it still looks professional.Cortana runs windows setup now right out of the box, and itâs a quick and painless process if you know your Microsoft password. Itâs a fun experience to unwrap and turn this laptop on and I can see someone really being engrossed over this by a Christmas tree with unwrapped gifts nearby. Not thirty minutes after I got this, and Iâve got Office installed to type this review, and Steam is downloading GTA V for testing its real performance.The laptop has a high performance SSD hard drive, with no moving parts, leading to a perception of a very fast system because Windows and your programs will load very quickly, however, thereâs only 211 gb free on the hard drive. Thatâs not a problem if you just delete games you arenât using, and adding another hard drive is possible. Bear in mind that thereâs no Blu-ray or DVD drive on this laptop, which is a good thingâ?Iâd rather have the extra space (where you can install an additional hard drive). This laptop has no moving parts aside from the keys on the keyboard, making the thing feel rock solid yet light for its size. The angular body is the most comfortable laptop Iâve typed on because my wrists and the angles just seem to match comfortably as I type. The keyboard isnât the mechanical joy of an old Thinkpad, but itâs easy to type on with the clearly lit keys, and itâs quiet to type on. As I write this review, Iâm typing quickly and easily. The touchpad is quite large and I really its subtle red frame, marking its place even in a dark room. I really like the way this thing feels and looks.I found wifi performance is excellent, particularly with a modern beam forming router. I used this laptop in a building where most wifi devices run into a lot of interference with the old steel construction, but this laptop kept working quite well. I recognize this is hardware overkill for office tasks, however even though Iâve got a few other laptops, this is the one I would take to a meeting or to type a paper. The screen is gorgeous! The audio is great for a laptop and I enjoy games and movies, but at home Iâll still pair with my Bluetooth soundbar for better bass.So letâs sum up things so far: the laptop is very nice to look at, with good sound, a great screen, good keyboard, great mouse, and itâs comfortable. Itâs easy to set up and will be the gift of the year on Christmas for a lot of people.The remaining matter is the raw performance. Is this thing really going to play those games well?Well, my first impression was that this laptop was a poser. Half the vents on the laptop are fake, etched in plastic, like a fake air intake on a cheap sporty car. There are two fundamental ways to cool a gaming laptop. Either you run two heat paths, metal and fans and vents, one for the GPU and one for the CPU, or you run a single one. This laptop looks like itâs the superior dual path version, and I believe Acer designed this case with the possibility of using that solution at a higher price point, but looking at the internals and the vents, itâs clear there is a single path sharing the CPU and GPUâs heat. That means heat will spike and it will accumulate faster. Iâll get back to this in a moment.The specs on this laptop are very similar to my desktop machine I built a couple of years ago. My desktop has a quad core i5 processor, slightly faster, and it has a GTX950, the equivalent last generation version of this GTX1050. (GPU numbers can be confusing, but the 9 or 10 in these numbers is the edition, think âyear of a carâs makeâ?and the 50 is the model, think âHonda Civicâ?. This laptop has 4 gb of video memory to my desktopâs two, and 4 gb is great, but otherwise the two systems are very evenly matched for performance.On paper, the specs of this laptop are great for playing games. My desktop with very similar specs plays GTA V, Skyrim SE, Echo, and many other modern games with graphics settings set very high, and it does so reliably. This laptop has a slightly more modern GPU, but that generous 4gb should mean excellent performance, actually in the realm of VR games.My expectation was that the cooling system would be overwhelmed quickly, and the laptop would either need to be set to âmediumâ?settings on games, or I would see a lot of framerate problems, and my desktop, with its equivalent specs but drastically better cooling, would outshine the laptop. So to test this I ran the Unreal âHeaven 4.0â?benchmark on its most extreme settings on both this laptop and my desktop, in the same room.Again I was really impressed with the screen on the laptop as I ran the benchmark. It just looks great. The laptop noticed the tough test quickly and the fans kicked in, making the laptop sound like a PS4 running hot. It topped off at about 67 degrees C (Which is about as hot as youâd want a chip to get to preserve its reliability), and my desktop topped off at about the same point. The systems had both reached their thermal limit and would not push harder, instead dropping performance, which is exactly how they are designed.My expectations of the laptop being crushed by my desktopâs performance were quickly proven wrong. The laptop was doing slightly better than the desktop, and continued to do so for most of the 26 benchmark tests. At one point, the toughest test, its framerate dropped to 9 frames per second, but on average it did a little better than the desktop. Iâve attached a screenshot of the benchmark comparison.So, the bottom line is that the cooling solution isnât the best design, but it is adequate for the GTX1050ti, which is a smaller, more efficient GPU design. Based on how fast those fans kicked in, I think if you use this laptop for gaming you should keep it clean and use a cooling pad, but its performance was rock solid, and that was a complete surprise to me after tearing down gaming laptops for reflows, to repair heat damage, and assembling dozens of gaming computers, which has been a hobby of mine for over 20 years. The single heat path in a gaming laptop really isnât the best but itâs working in this laptop, and that decision absolutely made it possible to sell this laptop at such a competitive price.I played two of my favorites, Typing of the Dead, and Grand Theft Auto V (on medium to high settings) and after several hours have concluded this is a wonderful experience. Iâm very tempted to get a VR headset to use with this laptop, which means I have a much stronger impression of its ability to take abuse than I did before I tested it. But if you research the 1050ti for VR you will learn it's really the bare minimum for VR. Just keep that in mind.I conclusion, I love using this for non-gaming tasks, like typing, it looks and feels great, and the performance is impressive. There are compromises, and I think they are well justified by the price. This is a great buy if you donât need the absolute top of the line.Quick Update: After reading the other reviews I decided to grab a spare laptop hard drive and try to install it. I saw that there was a bag of extra screws in the box labelled âHDD Upgrade Screws.â?I removed one long screw from the base revealing a pouch style suspension for an extra hard drive, and a typical SATA cable. I unscrewed that, plugged in the hard drive, and put all the screws back. The hard drive worked just fine in Windows. So it appears these laptops do ship with everything you need to add a second hard drive.
So many mixed feelings about this thing from people who say "buy the better one" well I DID NOT. I bought this because it fit my budget and man am I glad I did. The haters all said it wont do X or it struggles with Y, well F those haters. This thing is smooth, looks cool, and runs like a dream. I've been playing League of Legends mostly but I confirmed it would run PubG and CSgo with no issues. If you don't have the funds for a Predator and just want a laptop that CAN game this is the one. Not to mention, its a laptop that can game for under 1k.
I purchased this laptop for $750 which at this point in time is a great deal. It came with Nvidia 1050ti graphics card which is good for 1080p gaming. 1050 would be a little too low in graphics power. Nvidia 1060 graphics card would be better but most laptops that carry one cost closer to $1000. Once you start reaching that high in price Iâd start looking into gaming PCâs because youâll get more bang for your buck.The hard drive I received was a IntelÂ® SSD 600p. Which is a pcie nvme type ssd hard drive. These are faster then sata based ssd hard drives which are faster then older hdd drives. Laptop starts really fast thanks to hard drive and does virus scans faster too.Battery life is good. It can supposedly go up to 8.5 hours but seems to be more like 6 hours for regular non-gaming tasks with brightness at half and WiFi on. Keep in mind if you try gaming on battery itâll only last about an hour or so.Overall I feel like this laptop is very well balanced at this price range that doesnât cut corners on any of the things I value in a laptop. Hard to find a better deal for a gaming laptop that can also double as something to get work done on.
I am very impressed with this so far. I managed to run GTA V Online smoothly on this pc at "normal" graphics settings. That's pretty impressive for the price as it is a very system demanding game. Plus, it looks pretty sleek. The battery doesn't last long if it's not plugged in but it's not intended to. This pc is intended for performance which takes power. If you need something that is going to have a long battery life for hanging out online or doing homework, you'll want to choose something different. We have only had it a week so I will update with any issues that arise.Dropping this rating to 3 stars. After just under 2 months of use - the keyboard stopped working. I tried to update the driver, was up to date. Tried to reinstall the driver, that did not repair it. Then I made the mistake of just shutting it down. Well...the power button is ON THE KEYBOARD. That means, once shut down, I was unable to turn it back on. It's now being sent in for repairs.Bumping this back to 4 stars because acer repair was very fast. However, they asked that I send the pc in the original packaging, but did not send it back to me in the original packaging, so now I no longer have it should anything else go wrong.
This is an excellent laptop for gaming, basic productivity, or even some coding for a Comp Sci/Technology student. It has a bright, somewhat color-accurate IPS display, a nicely spaced, back-lit keyboard with very quiet keys for typing, and of course the beasty combination of a 7th gen Core i5 processor, a GTX 1050 Ti GPU, and 8 GB of RAM to keep it all humming nicely. This is of course considered and "entry level" platform for a serious PC gamer, but this isn't really for a serious PC gamer is it? Just for reference I am coming from a Lenovo IdeaPad y410p with an intel i7-4700MQ processor, a GT 755M GPU and also 8 GB of RAM, and that is a really nice mid-tier gaming laptop from about 5 years back and a great machine. Though the cheaper i5 included with this machine is still outstripped, power-wise, by my 5 year old i7 (with hyper-threading) the overall build of this budget acer gaming PC absolutely destroys everything else on the Lenovo performance-wise. The newer i5 is neck and neck with the i7, but the "budget" GTX 1050 Ti with 4 GB of VRAM (vs. the GT755M 2 GB VRAM) and 256 GB SSD make a gigantic difference in how games load and play.Why do I call this "Gamer Lite"? Well because this laptop really only comes with the bare minimum required for a PC gamer. You only get a 256 GB SSD, and 8 GB of RAM. The real excellent upgrade is the GTX 1050 Ti GPU, which is freakin stellar for a PC priced under $1000 USD. Basically, you get everything you need to run most AAA titles at High settings, ON A LAPTOP THAT COSTS $750 USD! 256 GB isn't gonna give you a lot of space for a huge library (obviously) but the fact that it is solid state makes it so quick. Win 10 boots in seconds. Steam opens literally instantly. Instantly! Not exaggerating. Kiss those long load times goodbye.I did a lot of research before I decided on this laptop, and there are a few reviewers (YouTube and website reviews) out there talking a lot about heat. It is true, this particular laptop doesn't have the best design for cooling, but it is totally fine for normal use. I mean if you want to run a AAA title on Ultra settings for several hours then yeah, your CPU and GPU are gonna get hot and start to degrade. But this thing isn't for that. That's what a maxed out gaming tower with 10 fans and liquid cooling is for. Go buy that if that's what you want to do. I've seen external heat tests on this thing that look totally in line with what you would want from a performance laptop. If it gets hot then that means its time to go outside and talk to people LOL.Honestly, great value for an excellent setup. Not the best. Not even by far the worst. At this price point your options are quite limited but this is really the best bang for your buck. And also, pretty nice to use just as a PC.
For the money, I'm satisfied w/ my purchase. I bought it to be used as a remote work PC for software development (.NET apps) and for occasional gaming.Screen: Colors and black levels are great. Its max brightness is probably too dim for the laptop to be used outdoors, if that's important to you.Keyboard: Nice to type on. I still prefer "full keyboard" laptops like Alienware and old Dell laptops, but I can type quickly on this and it's comfortable enough.Heat: It's pretty much always warm, regardless of what you're doing. The upside is that's true when gaming; it doesn't get extremely hot.Weight: It doesn't feel heavy in my lap and it's well balanced. It's very easy to open and close the screen one-handed. Good build quality.Battery: OK. So long as the 1050ti GPU is off, it seems to have a ~4hour battery (of actual use). Since this is a gaming PC, I feel that's decent.Performance: Witcher 3 runs at 55-60fps consistently w/ 1600x900 and high graphics (hair works off) and looks GREAT! Titanfall 2 "feels" like it runs @ 60fps with 1080p and high graphics, but I haven't ran it with FRAPS to be sure. Overwatch is an unwavering 60fps at high settings.Regarding upgrades: There is an extra hard-drive access panel and an access panel for (I assume) RAM. I opened the hard-drive panel, saw there was a cable and mounting hardware for an extra drive, so I connected a 256gb SSD I had from a prior laptop. I restarted the laptop, windows 10 detected the drive, and I was able to format it in seconds. I'll probably add a second 8gb stick of ram as a future upgrade.
I bought this model on Thanksgiving. It is NOT a 1050 Ti, it is just a 1050. I verified this with multiple pieces of software. It only has 640 CUDA cores and a base clock of 1354 MHz, which happens to be the specs for the GTX 1050 and NOT the GTX 1050 Ti.Acer Nitro 5 Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i5-7300HQ, GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 15.6" Full HD, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, AN515-51-55WL
My model is the i5-8550u + GTX 1050 model. After a week of playing around and testing various aspects of this laptop, I've come to the conclusion that while this does seem to be the best bang for the buck of convertible laptops out right now, it's really just that. Bang for buck, as opposed to best performance. I'll be evaluating this from 3 perspectives, the average laptop user [which this was not made for], the artist, and the gamer.-The Average User - 9/10 -The laptop is something else to look at. I'm not a fan of the black and red color scheme personally, but the shinny red hinges and bezel along the bottom of the laptop provide an uncommon aesthetic that while may not be the most business friendly, doesn't impose much on others either, and definitely is nice to look at from a personal setting. The aluminum chassis is very sleek looking, but is a finger print magnet. The whole device is, and I say this with caution towards the industry, "thin and light" enough to fit comfortably in my backpack without any real added heft. Bootup on the SSD is fast, and the whole OS maneuvering is snappy, and there's plenty of space for everything not in program files on the HDD. 8 GBs of RAM is more than enough for any everyday use scenario. The screen is more than adequate, in my opinion. It's not super bright, but bright enough to be used in a fully lit room [though outside, the sun is a bit too much for this to handle, due to gloss glare]. It has very wide viewing angles, and due to that and what seemed like more color distinction over my last device [Lenovo Flex 3], I confused it for an IPS display [apparently it's not]. Touch input is good for everyday maneuvering, being fairly accurate and fast [more on this in the Art section]. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on, with the travel distance being almost one to one with a full size keyboard [I don't remember the distance measurement], only getting squished on the right side of the keyboard, where the numpad [which I do appreciate the inclusion of] is. It has a red backlight, which is nice and bright enough, however, Acer has a 30 second timeout on the backlight, which cannot be disabled, and is very offputting and uncomfortable when using the laptop in a dark room, as I've now developed the habit of quickly hitting Ctrl before typing in order to turn on the backlight to find the homerow keys [which is doable, but more time consuming without the light staying on]. I would appreciate an Acer update to fix this, but apparently so would the rest of Acer's community. Trackpad is good, nothing to complain about, but an interesting thing worth mentioning is that it seems to have variable click sensitivity on the left and right click buttons. You can press them softly for a mushy click, or hard for a tactile one. Web browsing, typing, etc are all doable and enjoyable on this device, for the most part. Sound is not great. The speakers are advertised with Dolby Atmos, but are very underwhelming, with very little bass, and not the most enjoyable sounding treble. It's serviceable, but nothing to write home about. They also had a problem with popping slightly, but that was remedied by dropping the Realtek quality settings from 24 bit to 16 bit [no noticeable quality loss, just more consistently clear]. As a tablet (mode), the laptop is rather big and heavy at about 5 lbs, so it's not something you'd want to be standing with for a long time, but if sitting in a chair or in bed, works fine for extended use. The weight is the tradeoff you make for a dGPU. Battery life easily lasts 7 or more hours on light usage. Also worth mentioning that the laptop makes an audible beep whenever you unplug or plug it in.-The Artist - 7/10 -I have to say, I was really excited for the digital art potential of this device after my old Flex died on me, because it seemed to be the same idea, but with better internals, a bigger screen, and a numpad. However, I have to say I'm disappointed with the touchscreen performance of this laptop. I've heard that Windows Ink works great on this device, but as I did not have Ink support on my Flex, I have personal gripes with Wacom as a company so do not own a Windows Ink pen, and I use active or "nipple" styli to draw digitally, I am disappointed with the touch screen calibration of the device, which Windows does not allow adequate recallibration of [all you can do is adjust your pinpoint offset, not your input timing settings]. When trying to write or draw in any application that supports it [Paint, Paint.net, Medibang, Autodesk Sketchbook, etc {+my version of Photoshop does not support touch input at all}], quickly making nonlinear shapes with a stylus or your finger in a small area will often be confused for holding down your touch input and be read as an attempted right click instead of inputting the actual shape, such as how attempting to create a small set of spike or curve shapes will result in no registered input, or as a line between where you began the input and ended it. This problem cannot be fixed by Windows touch settings, but can be mitigated by touch-drawing as if you were sketching [many small lines to make a larger image, rather than continuous lines], and then smoothing the jaggedness out in a later layer. In addition, slowly trying to draw simple shapes like lines or curves will result in a shape that resembles a zig zag along the path you traced. This is a result of what seems to be lower refresh rates of touch input that seem to be present on the display, causing a smooth motion to be broken up into inaccuracies. This was not a problem in my past touch-art experiences, and is dismaying to see here. I also heard that the non-Nitro Spin 5 comes with an included Acer Ink-supported stylus, which is again, disappointing to not see here, for a higher retail price. However, since these issues can be worked around with technique adaptations, the device still gets a passing grade. You can still create art on it, and the more I do on the device, the more I adapt to it, but it's not as intuitive of an experience as I think it should be.- The Gamer - 8/10 -This is honestly not a great price to performance gaming machine, but to be fair, it's meant to be an jack of all trades, not a gaming specialty. 8 GB of RAM, while not always suitable for gaming and multitasking, was fine for anything I tested this device with, so long as I didn't leave my 30 chrome tabs open haha... Ahem. The GTX 1050, with 2 extra Gigs of VRAM dedicated to it works wonders on most things at 1080p; Medium to Max settings are enjoyable to playable on seemingly anything. The i5-8550u on the other hand... both does and doesn't work that same magic. I should say it works like a dream for the first 30-90 seconds of gaming... and then becomes a potato. The CPU is very capable, but is hindered by temperatures and Power Draw limits. It will begin a game running at the max 3.4 Ghz on all 4 cores, destroying the framerates [60+ fps] of any game I'd tried [which is admittedly not that many in one week, but they were two more demanding ones of Dark Souls 3 [many settings tested] and Final Fantasy XV [1080p average]]. However, after the aforementioned 30-90 second turbo limit, on stock settings, the CPU throttles down to about 1.1 Ghz, sometimes less, causing framerates to plummet into the unplayable territory, as if you had gone from a pseudo i7, which is what this is, to an Atom or Celeron. On these stock settings, temperatures were around 40-50 C idle, and averaged around 68-70 C under load. After using Intel XTU to undervolt -100 mV, interestingly, temperatures went up a few degrees, at 70-75 C under load, but performance increased by almost 500 Mhz, to averages of 1.4-1.5 Ghz under load. Which still isn't great, but is better, keeping games in the 30+ fps territory. However, Acer has placed a Power Draw limit on the CPU for when the GPU is active simultaneously. While on short turbo boosts, or when only putting the CPU under load, the CPU will draw about 25 W of power to reach 3.4 Ghz across all cores, stably, and at around or just below the same temps. But while the GPU is running alongside it, it will only draw a max of 10 W, which is less than the power draw it's even rated for [15 W]. This is ridiculous, because I've observed more temporary performance with no increased heat, and I haven't found a solution to it, but perhaps it's still more to do with thermals and means that the PU's could do with some thermal paste reapplication. However, I don't know Acer's warranty policy on this, so I'm avoiding it for the time being. One interesting thing to note, however, is during my FFXV test, which was ~6 hours long, performance at 1080p average settings started off in the more "just over playable" area of 35-45 fps, but after the laptop had been running for hours, getting uncomfortably hot to the touch all over [I was using a controller, thankfully], performance increased to about 40-55 fps on average. Still, needing to run something for hours to let the system heat up in order to get good performance isn't a valid [or really sensical] solution to an easily remediable problem. Dark Souls 3 had pretty jumpy numbers, still displaying great performance on high 1080p during turbo, but the most consistent long term playability [40-60 fps] I found was medium-high settings on 1600x900p.-Overall - 8/10 -This is far from a perfect device. It has its fair share of issues in every area, the most notable of which are cooling, keyboard lighting, and touch input, but it's made for a niche of people who need a device that can do a bit of everything. It's a good deal for the money compared to the (mostly Lenovo) competition, getting you a gaming and art capable machine with a powerful dGPU and an SSD+HDD combo, and [not offered by the non-Nitro Spin 5 models, or by many other 2-in-1s]. It gets a more-than-passing grade, but still has a lot of room for improvement in future models.
General Overall Review Before In Depth ReviewPros:*Powerful graphics card at a cheap price*Decent processor will get everything you need done fast*Comes with a SSD over a standard HDd*1080p resolution to watch Full HD content*Backlit keyboard to operate in the darkness*Not too heavy*Has a nice exterior design*Computer distributes heat well and fans keep it cool*Can expand hard drive storage with HDD or SSDCons:*Plastic material can make it feel cheap*Fans get loud when playing graphic intense games*Battery life is mediocre but if you use it as a gaming desktop alternative you'll keep the power plugged in*250GB storage (I won't say it's a con because of the price and the fact its a SSD which is better for gaming, if it was a 250GB HDD then I would list it as a con)I paid $699 for this laptop. And for the price I paid I'm thoroughly impressed. This computer performs like that of a $800-$1000 computer. Has enough RAM to execute all your programs, 1080p screen, a decent i5 processor and a pretty powerful graphics card for the price. Everyone always worries about needing an i7 processor for gaming but in reality if your graphics card is insufficient in this it's not then your processor won't give you any added benefit. What people don't realize is a i5 is more than sufficient in almost all cases to game if you have a good graphics card. In comparison to my i7 Lenovo there's really not much difference in performance rather the difference lies in the graphics card. About 4 years ago I paid $1100 for my Lenovo Y50 which had a NVIDIA GTX 860M and a i7 processor and I was looking for a cheap replacement for my laptop since it broke. But I was not really expecting much from the graphics card area especially at this low of a price. But surprisingly not only does it perform just as well it performs much better (new graphic card architecture and technology) for almost half the cost. At the time the 860m was a mid range graphics card for laptops. But back then the laptop version of graphics card (m) was not on par with it's desktop counterpart and in most cases only performed about 40-70% of what it's counterpart could do. But now with the new architecture and technology the laptop counterpart performs at 75-90% of it's desktop counterpart and actually is almost identical in performance since it's pretty much the same except for a few other tweaks but I digress. So the NVIDIA GTX 1050TI although a mid range chip performs so much better than mid range chips back in the day and especially for a laptop it packs a punch. Make sure when you get your laptop that it's the 1050 TI version and not just the plain 1050. The TI version packs a bit more of a punch which does make a difference. Because some people have complained and rated the computer poorly because they received a 1050 version and not the 1050TI.My only complaint is the plastic material in which it's made of vs the metal finish of my previous laptop. The plastic makes it feel cheap (well it is) but obviously it's more of an aesthetics thing than performance. And some complain about the hard drive space being insufficient. To be honest if you're using this computer for standard work the space will be more than sufficient enough for you, but if you game then it will run out fast but for the price you're paying it's quite a steal. Sure it's not a 1TB hard drive but it's a SSD which will increase the overall speed and performance of your computers load and boot times but also your games and overall SSDs are better for gaming. And there's an extra hard drive slot so you can always expand the hard drive manually either with a standard hdd if you're on a budget and need extra space or a 2.5 m sata II SSD if you want extra space with the continued faster performance. But you have to call Acer once you receive the product to get the HDD kit to add the extra storage. Aside from that the only other con is it can be loud when playing graphic heavy games but if you're alone and you have headphones on it won't bother you much. The fans although loud does keep the laptop cool despite the plastic.Overall the computer is a great purchase. Powerhouse performance for under $1000. Only difference between this laptop and others in the $1000 range is the hard drive space and sometimes the processor. As I said before the i5 processor is more than enough and you can manually add an extra HDD or SSD (just remember to call Acer to get the kit to expand storage it's free of charge) so technically there's not much difference maybe only in the material its made of.
Pros, Good keyboard & trackpad, decent screen, good for almost all games playing on high to meduim settings with 60 fps. Cons, thermals are good for older games but without a cooling pad it runs at 70 degrees c & could overheat when playing for a long time though I haven't had any issues. Overall this laptop is very good. I haven't played a ton of games but what I have & seen is running things like overwatch & Minecraft & some other games it runs good at high settings but starts to dull down when running at ultra but still runs well, Minecraft though runs at fully maxed settings with max draw distance with 100 fps.
Excellent gaming laptop for the money but sacrifices had to be made to keep the cost down.Things I like:Sleek designRespectable Hardware and Performance (Quad-Core i5, GTX 1050Ti, SSD, matte IPS monitor)Relatively lightweightThe M.2 SSD in my laptop is actually NVME (by Intel). Surely not comparable to a Samsung 960/961 but still faster than SATA protocol.Easy to upgrade RAM and add additional 2.5" sata HDD/SSD (fortunately my laptop came with the HDD kit included)Backlit keyboardUSB3.0 Type-CPrice (got it for $699+ 6% tax )Things I don't like:The monitor may be IPS but don't expect a high RGB coverage and it is quite dim.Only 2 USB3.0 ports (the other 2 are USB2.0)The Type-C port is not Thunderbolt compatible, which kind of defeats the purpose of a Type-C port...Even though the design is sleek and attractive, it is made of plastic which, honestly, feels kind of flimsy. The finish is indeed nice but coming from a DELL i7559 (still plastic but far more solid), this ACER doesn't make me feel very confident...The M.2 SSD is not accessible unless you remove the whole back plate of the laptop, making the replacement/upgrade unnecessarily difficult and will void the Warranty. I consider this to be a major design flaw.Battery life nowhere near the advertised one. It seems to me that a 48Wh battery just cannot provide 7-8 hours as ACER claims. My old DELL had a 74Wh battery and I was happy with its 5-6 hours of battery life.CONCLUSION:Overall I am happy with my purchase.The performance/price ratio is probably the best out there.Just don't have irrational requirements. This is a gaming-on-a-budget laptop, it's not a Premium or a niche product.It is focused where it counts for the purpose it was made (processing power for decent 1080p gaming).It was not made for ultra portability, photo editing or showing off.But it does deserve every penny...
Amazing computer for the given price; thereâs a coolboost system that you can turn on. If anyone plays overwatch; it runs on 70FPS with the power plugged in and roughly 50C-55C when running with coolboost on. If youâre the type to run multiple things in the background while playing games, then I would recommend a 16GB RAM. I found 8GB to be barely enough with only one application open at a time. It is heavier than I had expected to carry it around. If anyone wants to use it for classes and play games in-between, this is more than enough, as long as you donât mind the weight of it.
Bought two of these, both had a few hours of updates out of the box, which is to be expected. Downloaded and installed Guild Wars 2 immediately (the reason I bought two of these, for me and my wife) it runs it perfectly on max settings at 70+ FPS. Fans only kicked in when I joined a heavily demanding pvp match and they were very quiet. As to be expected for a laptop it runs a little warm, but letâs be honest thereâs a lot of demand on such a small package. Overall though it is a superbly fast computer that has thus far met and exceeded my expectations for a $700 laptop. Will update review after a week or so, hoping for more good reviews of it!
So far no complaints. About 2 weeks in so far and this laptop has peformed beyond what I expected. Not sure why everone is getting the wrong graphics card as mine definitely has the Ti. I mostly use this laptop for steam games and streaming online and so far it runs SpinTires and Rocket League at highest graphics settings while also running the webcam and recoeding software. Great laptop for the price!
So far I've been totally enjoying the experience on this laptop. It came with the parts needed to install an additional SSD or HDD which I bought separately and was more cost efficient might I add than buying the laptop with the 1TB HDD preinstalled. This laptop has not overheated and I have ran benchmark tests on this laptop as well as played for 6+ hours straight with games such as Lol, Dota 2, Overwatch, and Battlefront on full settings.Will give updates upon any change that takes place.
Great gaming laptop. Plays most AAA games with fault. Suggestion: when ordering this, order a 2tb hdd (7mm) to have a little more space. Very little bloatware, and since the startup system is on the ssd, it boots quite fast.
The wrong model was sent to me by a reseller, but the issue was resolved by Amazon. The computer itself is worth 5 stars.Superior to the more expensive MSI I got around the same time. Much better screen, even if it is a bit dim.PROS:Great hardware for the price, seems easy to upgrade the ram and HDD.Great screen for price. Great color and contrast. does not look washed out like other gaming laptop screens.Very fast SSD built in.Very easy to add an extra HDD.Great battery life. Over twice what I've seen for gaming laptops in the same price range. 8 hours if all settings are reduced. About 2 hours playing a mid-range game.CONS:Not enough to take a star off for, since it is still better than models that cost $200 more.Keyboard a bit cramped and will take some getting used to.Screen a little dim in sunlight.
Was the Ti version gpu, had the HDD mount kit and cable pre installed. The screen bezzel on the bottom is SCARY flexible though if i press on it LIGHTLY from the back the front pops out about a .25" which freaks the hell out of me. But otherwise seems ok. The built isn't the highest quality but its decent for a budget laptop. This thing literally boots in about 5 seconds to log on screen.Update:After doing a little gaming (BF3) performed very well fans are a little loud, doesnt get warm though. Suprised it only had 60ms latency when used with wifi with poor singal strength. Router is on thr other side of the house..
We ordered this laptop for my gf. She loves this laptop so much we almost bought a laptop from Wal-Mart but I went with Amazon and this is far better than anything I could have got for this price. Works great and fast. I use it to play world of warcraft. And it plays on high settings perfect. I would definitely recommend this for a first time gaming laptop unless you have another 500 dollar to add this is best for the price.
Since there are options for purchasing this laptop, this review is for the:"Acer Nitro 5 Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i5-7300HQ, GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 15.6" Full HD, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD"Pros:- GPU is awesome (Currently playing Ni No Kuni 2 and Overwatch with no problems)- Heat, while there, is pretty minimal- Easy to access extra internal SSD/HDD slotCons:- Extra internal SSD/HDD slot technically works, but it will often disconnect the drive (think USB thumb drive being removed).When I first got the laptop and installed the extra internal hard drive, everything was working really well! This lasted until about February and the hard drive started having intermittent connection issues. At first I had an HDD in there and though that the moving parts were malfunctioning so I put an SSD in there instead. Didn't fix the issue. Then I thought that perhaps the laptop wasn't providing power to the drive after a while due to power saving options and I disabled that. Didn't fix the issue. Maybe I didn't secure the drive well enough and it was moving around too much, so I placed it in a stationary place and got lucky enough to have the drive be recognized again. The issue was solved for about a day but ultimately didn't fix the issue. I still have not been able to access my SSD for longer than a few hours once every few weeks (so far it's been 6 days since it last showed up on my laptop).To be fair, I haven't talked with customer support, so they could possibly save the situation. I think the bottom line is that I would expect that paying any amount of money over $500 would mean that hardware problems would be minimized.Overall:The weight, GPU, CPU, feel of the material, and look of this laptop are great. I want to like the laptop, but the inability to consistently use the extra internal hard drive lowers the score. As such, I'd say this laptop is OK and would probably be worth buying between $600 and $700. For transparency, I was able to purchase this at $699.99.
Very well designed low budget gaming laptop. I have been using it frequently for the last month or so, and it has worked great! My previous laptop had an issue with overheating on the games I liked to play, but this one handles them well. The GPU is powerful and stays cool, and the laptop is well designed, especially for the price.Cons:- Screen doesn't get very bright (Bright enough, but I'm used to just slightly more)- Cooling fans are pretty loud (Not too big a deal for me, I'd rather it be cool than quiet for gaming)- Battery life is not great but I expected thatPros:- SSD is so nice!- Model I purchased comes with an additional 2.5" bay as well as a cord to plug in another HDD- GPU runs amazing and stays cool- CPU runs great for games and other programs- Windows touchpad drivers are really good- Installation was so simpleAll in all, I was very happy with this. It works great for what I want, and it came at a killer price for the SSD and GPU inside. There were no major corners cut creating this machine, and I am a very satisfied buyer.Update: Recently I added an HDD in the extra 2.5â?bay and it connected without a problem. There was no additional work I had to do other than plugging it in. They even provided the screws!
I want to say that Acer has done extremely well in marketing what is essentially a mid-range gaming computer for a very good price point indeed. Including shipping, I was able to get this machine for about $725 all told, which is an excellent for a computer with a quad core i5 and a 1050Ti; other machines with identical specifications retail for upwards of 900 dollars.I have yet to be disappointed; I've thrown almost all of the best games I have, including Gaijn's War-Thunder (2013) and Idea Factory's Cyberdimension Neptunia (2017) at this computer, and it handles them almost flawlessly at 1080p on maximum settings; in Cyberdimension Neptunia, which uses the Unreal 4 engine, there are a few hiccups down to 57fps when new effects come into play, but otherwise the system holds stead with barely any noticeable noise or heat; Warthunder never drops below about 77FPS. This is the machine you want if you want a budget gaming laptop that truly lives up to the advertising hype; the Nvidia GTX 1050Ti will be able to handle most items coming out within the next few years on medium-high settings at 1080p for at least the next 3-5 years.With that said, the computer gets four rather than five stars for a couple of reasons. First, because while the chassis is solid and well made, the IPS screen itself is a bit dim, and the plastic frame for it feels a bit fragile; it's certainly not made of as durable a material as the actual chassis. Second, because the audio seems a bit off; while this is a function of the extra subwoofer/ bass settings they seem to have added to the audio card, it makes the audio a bit less clear than on my older computer, an HP Envy 17 S143CL model, which was purchased for $800 in December 2016.
The Acer Nitro 5 feels very fragile. I was in constant fear of breaking it. Part of that is the fact that I dropped, all told, $750 on this piece of equipment and that makes you worry about those things, but the bigger part is that it's simply cheaply made. This laptop looks great on paper, and you KNOW they have to cut corners somewhere, right? Well Acer decided to sacrifice build quality here, and it shows. Well, it doesn't show, and that's the problem. You won't realize it's cheaply made until you actually get your hands on it; feel the tightness of the usb ports when you plug something in and wonder if they're going to break, as you place the laptop in your bag and have serious doubts about its ability to hold up to simple foot travel.In terms of hardware it really is a good deal, but there's a reason other laptops in this category go for several hundred dollars more. They are built to last. This isn't.Mine came with a defective screen. There was significant backlight bleed (yellow splotches of light around the edges of the screen that show up when dark colors are displayed) that got worse over the few weeks I owned it. Acer would cover a replacement screen under warranty and asked me to send it in. They wanted me to pay for shipping, but I asked them to cover shipping both ways because it was a manufacturing defect, and they agreed without any hassle. I'm upset that my brand-new PC was defective out of the gate and I had to ship it in for repairs. I returned it instead because I could not trust the build quality. Acer is a good brand but save up and get a predator instead.3 stars for the laptop. It's not actually that bad. Docked a star for poor quality control.
I got this laptop because I wanted to get into PC gaming. After owning this product for a few months, I can honestly say that I can recommend this product to anyone thinking about getting into computer gaming. It runs games like CoD WWII, Killing Floor 2, and other non-intensive games flawlessly. Ram and HDD/SDD are easily upgradeable.
First off, for about $750 I do not believe you can beat this at all. I am not totally sure what SSD was "supposed" to come with this unit but my unit came with an Intel 600p pci-e SSD, to me to have an SSD of that class is great especially at this price point, while it is not the best, its better than a sata version, it also came with 8 gb ddr4 2400 MHZ ram. The screen is not perfect but it is still very nice. To get a 1050 Ti 4 gb, a true 7th gen quad core, a 1080p IPS display, and usb-c it is top notch. This is by no means a high end gaming rig, that is what my Ryzen 7 and GTX 1070 are for. This is great for a second computer or work machine to get work done and being able to game on the go as well. Power, speed, and features wise, this is as powerful as most regular desktops, if you are in the market do not hesitate to buy this. In my opinion anything more powerful should probably be a dedicated desktop anyways
So far it's great! Audio, and picture quality is superb! Keys are responsive. It feels sturdy and not cheap. The design of the shell is awesome. Easy to setup. It does come with the 1050 Ti.How to check your graphics card to verify:From the Start menu, open the Run dialog box.Type dxdiag.Click on the Display tab of the dialog that opens to find graphics card information (for me it was window 2)
I spent days searching for the best laptop in the $800 range. As I ran into the Nitro 5 I saw many complaints of overheating and a bad thermal design. I ordered the laptop and hoped for the best. After recieving the laptop I ran the graphics on many games at ultra high or very high. The laptop kept a very stable temperature and ran the games smoothly. With that being said, it does come with a Gtx1050 although advertised as 1050ti (you can upgrade it to 1050ti for about $150 more when purchasing) but besides that everything is amazing. Great display, super fast, and decent speakers for a gaming laptop (donât expect much base). If youâre searching for a gaming laptop or a laptop just for everyday use, Iâd highly recommend this product.
Really good notebook however I strongly recommend adding 8GB of RAM... I did and I can run more demanding games with no issues...
I hope everyone had a great holiday and this is one of my 2017 Holiday gifts to myself. As for background please check out some of my reviews I enjoy tech and have reviewed several types of systems. I brought this system for one purpose to match it with my Samsung Odyssey VR Headset for Windows mixed reality.From a price standpoint you would be hard pressed to find another Gamming Laptop in this price range with these features. I searched the net and the pricing was the best here on Amazon. I set up the laptop with the Samsung headset on Christmas and it passed all the test with flying colors I used it most so far to play Space Pirates an excellent VR game. I also have installed Star Trek Bridge Crew and Arizona Sunshine for non VR I have the Division on it running at full 60FPS. The laptop allows my VR to run at the full 90hrz on all my VR Games I can confirm mine does have the 1050TI not the 1050. The Laptop came with no bloat wear and was easy to setup by voice. I am certain the one I got has the drive holder for me to add an additional drive to the system I did not get it to use it on battery power for any long periods of time I understand these laptop are not made to game for hours on end with just battery powerEven with the speakers faced down I still get great sound from them and the screen being matt is a pleasure glossy screens are to me over rated. Start up time is very fast and if you want to really use this laptop you will need an additional drive the included 256Gigs will fill up fast. This is I think one of if not the best first Gamming Laptop you can get and still be under $1000.00 If you have the cash and can afford a $1000.00+ machine then go for it but for me this hit a very nice sweet spot and it means I can take my VR on the road to let friends play with it.
I downloaded World of Warships, and it handles it very well. Easily gets 75 fps, on highest settings and the graphics are great on screen. I also added a 128gb ssd, which turned out to be a very quick and easy upgrade. the wiring and plug were there inside the access panel and it just took a few minutes to do. Battery life is fine as long as I'm just surfing the web. I always have it hooked to ac power when game playing though. I've used the wifi to connect to mobile hotspot on my iPhone and it works very well. I've also used the Bluetooth for a gaming headset. I've also downloaded and played World of Tanks on this laptop at highest settings....gets same framerate as on my pc at home.
This laptop is my first gaming laptop and I love it. It runs very well with the help of intel i5. This game easily runs games like Overwatch at 60 fps and never crashes. The keyboard feels very nice and is very quiet. The backlit feature is very good-looking and lights up the keys just enough to see them in the dark. The cooling system can keep the temperature of the laptop down enough that it does not have any problems. This machine also has the ability for you to add an extra hard drive in case you need it. Screws are included in the box so that if you decide to buy another hard drive, you can install it right away. One problem that I do have that I have seen other people having is that my laptop will randomly shut off when not charging. I am not sure why this happens but I just though I should include this in my review. Otherwise, this laptop is a great buy for those who want an affordable laptop that can game and get work done. I highly recommend it and hope the buyers love it as well.
Impressed by the speed and performance and all the features. However, would have liked it better if the battery was easier to replace. This model has a built-in battery that can be changed if you open the whole thing up, which I will regret later on when I have to, but, for the rest, it's perfect.As a software developer, it's perfect for programming as well!!
I absolutely love this laptop. It's the only gaming 2-in-1 ultrabook I've ever found, and I've been searching for years. It also offers both a SSD and separate storage HDD, a surprise at this size and price. The only thing I'd change is the power port - I worry about the durability of standard laptop power connectors, but this one may prove to be perfectly durable.
I bought this laptop for gaming and working. It fulfils my requirements: runs PUBG at 1080P High settings at mid-50s FPS.I do not identify any thermal issues with my device. I am surprised at how good the speakers sound. The screen is acceptable, not great. Built quality is decent.
Works fine. Plays the games I need it to play. Boots fast. Like the lighted keyboard, however, the keyboard is VERY hard to see without the power supply plugged supply because the lighted keyboard only work with the power supply attached. The keys become totally black without the light. There should be a way to use the KB light without the power supply.
Pros. Great performance and graphics. A good buy for the price. I play far cry 3-5 plus primal. Also fallout 3,Vegas,and 4. Love it.Cons. No CD,DVD, blue ray. The sound/speakers suck. There fine in a quiet environment. Storage space is small but very very fast.
Great hardware spec, good looks, bargain price. What more could you want in a gaming laptop. Only con is there is only 1 usb3.0 connection and 2 usb2.0. this can easily be fixed with a USB hub though so not a deal breaker for me. If you had a little more cash to play with the Acer Predator Helios is another good buy, $350 more but you get an i7 and a gtx1060.
Great Laptop for the Price.Has a 2.5" drive bay for a HDD or SSD.Ram with heat spreader shielding do not fit well, so it can be a challenge to fit.
Very solid build for the price.Pros:-Higher than average battery life-Very Beautiful Screen-Extremely value worthy proposition for the specs, next best price is +$350-For the price the materials are niceCons:-Bulky Power Supply-Only Scales to 1050ti in current iteration- Low storage on lower end models( easy to upgrade though)
Great budget system. I had to add a 500GB ssd to the available expansion tray, but that was easy. Runs all the games I've played on high settings and no problems so far. I mostly play FPS games online in multiplayer, BF1, BF4, Titan Fall, Battlefront 2, etc.. I don't get any stutter or lag and I use the cheap, but reliable, G602 wireless mouse and a DIY lapdesk that is foldable, for the best portable budget system.
This laptop has all the features it's supposed to, but a couple days after arrival it started having sudden battery disconnects, which turned out to be connected to a screw in the bottom that wasn't properly tight. After fixing that, it has started having overheating issues when I play games like Skyrim or Starcraft 2, and it has frozen up several times, which I've traced to the hard drive and/or ram running at 100%. Still a good computer for the price, but after these issues I would definitely recommend adding the extra ram card and HDD in the hopes that they would fix these problems. Fortunately these parts are accessible through hatches in the back, so I will be adding them as I am able.
Works great, though battery doesn't last quite as long as I hoped. Even with mild use (only browsing the internet) the battery life fluctuates between 2-4 hours.
My son wanted this for his pc gaming. He is a hardcore gamer and needed something much better than out year old desktop. He is really pleased with this and if you knew how hard he is to please with the geology items you would probably think this was the best computer ever made because I do now (lol).
I love my new laptop I can play games like Destiny 2 & The Division, basically any game I want to play at really good settings. I love the fact that it has a USB type-c port so I can charge my phone on it. I carry it everywhere with me, it replaced my Surface and I couldn't be happier.
This thing rocks, i been using it for a week now and its just great, only problem is no HHD space, but it can be upgraded, there is a spot to install an HHD and comes with 4 screws for instaling the hhd you buy. 1050 ti got it only a amazons choice deal 660 dollars, shit is beast mode for that price.
I love this laptop. I'm a huge gamer so when I got sick and couldn't make it upstairs to my desktop, I was worried I wouldn't be able to play my games. I was hesitant to get a laptop, but I was pleasantly surprised. The graphics and audio are amazing and flawless. It plays League of Legends, Minecraft, Rust, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more on high settings. This was really worth every penny.
Wanted to love this laptop. Faithful to Acer for years. Screen bleeds extremely bad. Top of computer gets scratched very easily. When keys are being used for games, touchpad is unresponsive. Wish I would have returned it. Use my 6 year old Acer more than this garbage. Never again!
This computer is a beast for the price. Been using it nonstop for about a 2 weeks.Picture is really nice HD displayConstruction material qualities is nicer then expected at this price rangeSound is nice qualityWould be 5 stars but I was very nervous opening the packing because the box was damaged and the packing wasn't great but everything was fine.And I have 1050ti
Decent laptop overall, but great laptop on a budget. Does feel pretty plasticky, but itâs ok. My only problem is with the WiFi repeatedly switching, but that can be solved with an Ethernet cable. It can run Minecraft with intense shaders, Planet Coaster (although frames are dropped), Fortnite, PUBG, and everyday tasks well. Video processing should be ok if it is light, but it might not be able to handle intense graphic editing. Overall great laptop for the price.
Overall for this price range I donât think you can do much better. The FPS for rocket league, fortnite, and csgo are acceptable (above 60, 120ish for RL). I use it to watch videos/browse and play games when Iâm traveling. I would buy it again.
Great laptop for the given price. It IS a 1050TI. Don't regret buying it.Pros:Boots up very quicklyHandles games well (stays quiet & keeps cool)Type-C portSD Card portBig screenDecent battery lifeKeyboard feels very similar to a desktop one.Cons:Heavy (but as expected from a gaming laptop)Touchpad is terrible. I fly a lot, so ideally I'd just pop out my laptop and start gaming. That's a no with this frustrating touchpad.
In the event that I actually received the laptop I ordered, this would be a perfect review. But that didn't happen.I ordered a GTX 1050 Ti. That was very much specified in my order. And I bought the laptop immediately after Thanksgiving. Upon receiving the package, I felt something was amiss, because the box - and the laptop itself - had stated it ran on the base GTX 1050 GPU. I conducted a few tests on this front, mostly in regard to gaming (Overwatch, to be specific) and the frame-rate of that title between a 1050 and 1050ti. In short, let's say it was obvious I didn't get what I purchased. I'm sorry - but why the confusion here?Because I'll admit: it's a fantastic piece of hardware minus the somewhat flimsy plastic design around the edges of the keyboard andAcer Nitro 5 Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i5-7300HQ, GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 15.6" Full HD, 8GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, AN515-51-55WLÂ screen, and my aforementioned issue.
I really enjoy this laptop. Probably my favorite owned laptop so far. It runs the Oculus Rift surprisingly well; I haven't had any problems running any VR games I've tried so far. Pleasantly surprised. If you're planning on going the most cost-effective way to get into VR, this is it.A couple of small things I've noticed, good and not-so-good:I love the way the keyboard feels. The material is nice, as well as the way the keys feel when pressed. It just feels nice to me.The housing between the keyboard and trackpad flexes rather easily. This isn't a problem, but it's also not a good thing.I enjoy the way the trackpad feels; it's a nice and smooth material.The overall look of the laptop in general is nice, in my opinion.Though this model supports a Core i5 processor, it's actually faster than a lot of available Core i7 processors, so if you're shopping based on processor power, you can pretty much count this as an i7 - unless you're shopping for hardcore gaming.The key shapes can be a little strange, but only for keys that aren't often used. Some, such as the numpad, look a little squished - rectangular.Overall, I was second-guessing my decision to buy this laptop while waiting for its arrival, but I have been consistently and pleasantly surprised with this machine so far. Very well worth the money.
Well have had it for about 6 days and no problems. I run BOINC (Seti@home) service so the processor, memory and video card have been running at about 90% 24/7 during this time. No hiccups at all. The wireless is phenomenal using the MIMO connections. I have a TP-LINK Router that supports MU-MIMO so they work great together. The system at times is a little slow even with the BOINC service shut down but I guess I'm just used to the performance of my AMD FX-8350 8 core 4Ghz processor in the big PC. I'll get used to it :-)I like the expansion on this laptop, room for a standard hard drive and two slots for memory expansion (1 already has the 8GB installed.) I'll probably upgrade the 256GB SSD with a larger one in the near future, 256 is a bit small.I'm doing my families Genealogy and since my old laptop was literally falling apart, this will be great asset when I go home and do some more research.I think this is a keeper, I've had Acer laptops in the past and had good luck with them. I'll keep you posted on any issues that may arise in the future, for now I'm very satisfied.
Great screen only thing I didnât realize is that it doesnât have a rom drive.
Great laptop with no problems. Doesn't overheat at all while gaming. Also, the sata and the HDD caddy were included with my laptop and after seeing other reviews i'm happy about this. The specs are good for the price tbh. Don't expect to run high demanding games at ultra settings tho. it's a med-range gaming laptop.
Bought two of these to play overwatch with my wife after two of our older computers started having issues. They run the game well on low settings at 130-150 fps. Good screens and don't get hot.
Works great for all of my games and photoshop now runs 10x faster than on my last computer. I'm writing this review on this.
Excellent when it works. It is now dead. The screen started to strobe. It wouldn't open programs, which I had to reinstall. Then it quietly switched itself off...with a full battery...and it won't re-start. Since the battery is integral, there is no resetting it by removing and replacing the battery. Will trouble shoot but little more than two months of light use and it is dead? Disappointing.
This laptop is a well rounded laptop not only for gaming but everything else such as browsing the web, watching movies or typing notes. The only downside is that the battery doesn't last very long after usage. This is expected as it has a powerful CPU and GPU.
So far this laptop is what I was expecting! A quality computer for decent gaming. I can use fairly decent graphic settings on my games and still get a good FPS it has an awesome design and isnât too bulky. The keyboard is kind of close together but itâs a laptop what do you expect. I was however disappointed with amazonâs delivery packaging. They used a box much larger than the laptop box itself which could have risked the computers safety.
This is a pretty cool laptop. Aesthetically it's really pleasing. the keyboard has red back lighting (these are the only LED's and they dont change colors) and it has some subtle but cool red accenting. One thing that did suck was that After having it about two weeks, the screen started freaking out. I have a warranty for it so I do plan on sending it back to get that fixed. If I move the screen in a certain position everything is fine. Other than the odd screen issue, I'm pretty happy with this laptop. At 15 inches, it's rather large, but the screen is a decent IPS 1080p panel. Full size keyboard, no windows precision drivers on the touchpad, so that is a little hard to use but a mouse makes that more manageable. No disk tray, 3 usb ports (one of them is a 3.0, the other two are 2.0), ethernet, usb c, and full size hdmi. Mine has the gtx 1050ti, which I would definitely recommend, It can run most new games at medium settings at around 60fps. I wouldnt recommend running this for gaming on battery power though , If youre using the graphics card the battery only lasts about an hour. Otherwise, just for web browsing or working the battery lasts about 4 hours. Its not great, but you get what you pay for. Decent build quality, a good looking laptop and decent performance. Overall I would recommend this to others
Computer is great and very quick out of the box. Has a Intel m.2 ssd so thats a good thing. There was a slight problem when I got my package and that was the bad thing. The seal on the Acer Nitro box was opened and covered up by another of the same sticker and was really suspicious because the description of this item was new.edit: one week later and it fails to boot.... and the fans really crank up when gaming.
Wow what a fantastic computer! Updated it and starting throwing down on mechs right out of the box. Love it. Will probably add HDD in the future. It is well worth the money because I'm totally on a budget.
This is probably the best bang for you will get if you want a laptop. Honestly anything more and I would say you should just build an at home rig. This will run destiny 2 at 60fps in highest settings (while plugged in) so basically it will play just about anything you could want. Just note battery life is about 1-2 hours off the charger and will throttle back FPS and screen brightness.. got mine when it was on sale for $699.
Great laptop, it can run pretty much anything you throw at it in good quality. Just make sure you download gpu-z to check if your 1050ti is there mine was but the on board software only picks up the integrated graphics which gave me a bit of a scare. All in all fantastic purchase and would 100% recommend to anybody trying to game on a budget.
Pros:Very fast boot,great vga for the most apps and games,nice backlight keyboard,good variety of portsCons:The screen is mediocre,low battery capacityFor the cost is a very good choise , and iam very happy for the purchase and for the price tha i bought the laptopUntil now i have not found anything wrong about this laptop except the mediocre ips screen
Laptop is really fantastic! My only issue is the speakers crackle when it starts and when it plays any type of media at a medium to loud volume. Other than that it plays games really well. Got it so I could play games like Elder Scrolls Online, Fortnite, 7 Days to Die, and Age of Empires Definitive edition. So far itâs played 7 days to die and age of empires on max settings with no problem. Would recommend!
Use this at work for a few games, runs well, havent had it freeze up or anything. plays TheHunter: all of the Wild excellently! Very happy and satisfied with it.
Fantatic beast of a laptop, it completely out performs my desktop which I put together just 3 years ago. It disperses the heat of the cpu/gpu very well, so much so that I have played a high demaind game whil the laptop was actually on my lap.
It arrived sooner than the original delivery date which I love. It can be a little slow at times but Itâs perfect for what I play which is the sims. It can handle the extra expansion packs for sure. Quality is very good. I do recommend it.
I have had this laptop for a month now, and used it enough to feel like I can give a proper review:I would have given this 4 stars, but it wouldn't feel right. For the money, this laptop is absolutely phenomenal. I have a desktop that is my main rig (i7-8700k, two 1080ti, 64gb ram etc..) so this one was going to be for travel gaming and school/work computer programming. I have used it for all of the games and programs I use it for and it has yet to ever let me down. Games in 60 FPS no problem with high settings. I can play HOTS with my friends with no worry of losing frames or horrible stuttering. I even ran some 3D Mark tests and the 1050ti scored WAY higher than I expected. Heat stays pretty low and I have absolutely zero complaints except for one super minor thing:The reason for the possible 4 stars - the laptop is black and shows where my hands rest. It is a super picky reason to almost drop a star, which is why I did not. I almost always have microfiber towels with me, so I just wipe it down quick and it's good to go!I will be upgrading the RAM from 8gb to 32gb and then adding a 1TB HDD to the empty bay for more game and program storage. Sucks that things are so expensive right now but it is what it is!
good one, get hot when i play PUBG and OVERWATCH. but act just fine
I'm using this computer for work as well as playing League of Legends and WoW. It runs both of them very well and the start up time with the SSD is about 10 seconds. The keys have a solid feel of mechanical, but aren't super noisy, so I'm not bothering my coworkers. Loving it and very happy with my purchase!
Beautiful laptop. 1050Ti runs extremely well with crisp, beautiful picture. Games run smoothly with popular titles like Overwatch and PUBG. Love it. Fantastic laptop for price.
Had it for almost a month and I love it! I play the Sims 4 on it and it works amazingly with it!
UPDATE: Returned the original laptop, and re-ordered. The new laptop came with the correct (1050Ti) graphics card. Extremely happy with the laptop and the customer service!Laptop itself is great. Performs well and has solid feel. Like others here, I received a GTX 1050 graphics card, not the GTX 1050Ti. Had to contact Amazon and return for a refund, but customer service was very helpful. If you order this, make sure you receive the 1050Ti.
After a few days after purchase, I must say that this is a fantastic purchase for the price. Granted, I do not keep up with recent laptop technology as it hits the market, but compared to the Asus laptop that i have upgraded from that was new about 4 years ago, this product is an entirely new generation from my previous experience. I must say that still, after years of development the track pads of these more affordable laptops are still not nearly as good as the front runners, such as apple. Even with this downfall, the performance with the SSD makes the operating system really snappy and the ability to upgrade the RAM adds and included bonus for performance. This is by no means a performance gaming system that will deliver 4k or VR capabilities, but if you are looking for a decent, well priced laptop with incredible potential for general use, artistic and occasional gaming capabilities, this is the product you have been looking for! The keyboard feels nice, backlit keys(in just the red LED) is nice, 2 in 1 maneuverability is surprisingly useful(I like to put it into tent mode with a PS4 controller when I'm gaming), screen looks great, touchscreen is surprisingly responsive, speakers are better than expected, the red accenting looks nice and you just can't complain about what you have paid for. The only thing I would ask for is a more narrow bezel on the screen, but really, what does that matter?
Good cost-performance. However, the open source nVidia graphics card driver on Linux has bugs and it will cause the system freeze. So please only use the Intel integrated graphics card driver or try the nVidia official close source driver if you will install Linux on this laptop.
Great on the go light gaming machine for the money. Thermal trottles to all hell anytime something heavy work load is thrown at it. Poorly designed fan placement.
No issues this far. Works as intended. Wish it had a bigger SSD. Might put a HDD in it as well.
Great laptop. Enjoyed so far.
This could have been a great laptop, except for one irritating and one fatal flaw. The irritation was the significant light bleed in several corners and along two sides of the screen. I know the difference between "normal" IPS glow, and light bleed due to poor manufacturing and quality control. This was the latter. The panel is simply bonded too tightly with the chassis, and slightly warped in a few places, so that the LCD screen is compressed and lets through too much light from the LED's behind it.The second, and really inexcusable flaw, was a loose touchpad that made a clicking/rattling noise with every touch, swipe, or any other contact between my fingers and the pad. Not just button presses, but any touch made this noise. It was incredibly distracting. How Acer lets products in this condition make it out of the factory is beyond me. Do they really expect people to keep something like this? So this laptop got returned, and it's time to try a different brand.
Best price/performance on the market. I'm not a heavy gamer, so the 1050ti fits perfectly for me.The build is very good, but not perfect.It's everything that a 5 start reviews say it is.
Good quality! Very quick! Would recommend
Does what I need it to, but wish the battery life was longer. Only get a couple of hours before needing a charge. This is about usual for most laptops, but still a disadvantage.
Graphics arent good for a gaming laptop. Looks cool tho!
Noisy, overheats. Overall not worth it. I recommend paying the extra 1k for the more expensive 2 in 1's.
My son plays minecraft, steam and xbox games on this and loves it!
Amazing laptop.
Purchased this computer to play a video game my other computer could not handle and it works flawlessly!
I like this laptop i play 4 or 5 hours dialy and i no have any problems in this first month's
one problem I have is cooling keeping it at a okay temperature is hard if your playing extreme games such as h1z1 or insurgency but turning down the graphics helps a lot. Overall I'm happy with my purchase
I love this computer but my only issue is that will not update windows 10, keep getting a message of corrupted files. The laptop is on the way back. Was ship today.
Excellent for gaming, run with normally Battlefield 4, Fortnite and Editing videos..
Canât beat it for the price
Great gaming laptop for the money. I'll start out saying i really only play World of Warcraft and a few simple games on steam, but for that purpose, I've found only minor faults with this machine. Wow runs smoothly even in new areas with dense player load, but this is on a custom setting i use that's below ultra but above middle of the road. Pros: great performance for the money, looks good, solid build quality, decent battery. Cons: sound quality through stock speakers is lackluster, keyboard lighting features are basically nonexistent, 1050ti already technically outdated, but solid for the price point, cooling fan is a bit loud. I realize it may sound like im beating up on a computer i gave 5 stars, but I could not find something better for the price.
Laptop for our son, battery drains fast, but it was on the reviews, other than that works well.
The biggest problem I have with this computer is that it will shut off at random times for no apparent reason. It is not overheating and it can happen whether using 5 windows or none. No rhyme or reason. The other thing that is annoying is that this computer boasts its graphics capability, but bogs down with simple video editing. This was a large reason for my purchase of this computer.It is hard to see a plus with this computer with the intermittent power issues. I have read that others experience the same now and there is little resolution available. I guess I can say that it is working for the time it takes to write this review.
I bough this machine for my son and he loves it. It is a great product with high specs, low noise and fast. The international delivery was excellent. The screen is huge and the touch screen is great.
My son loves his new computer! Much cheaper than purchasing one from Best Buy.
Great gaming laptop on a budget..nothing to hate ...
The sound quality of the laptop is really bad, it keeps making weird sounds in the background
Sound drivers need a bit of work, mine are crackly from time to time, but restarting it works for that issue. Other than that entirely worth it
Great laptop , same item description , very fast . Graphic is high - ultra for all 2017-2018 games with no lagFifa 18, bf1, gta v , pes 18 , AC:O
really enjoyed my new laptop,does everything I need.very happy with the purchase and price
Exactly what I wanted for the right price. Lighting fast internet speed and smooth graphics. Perfect
I'd say this is a really great purchase. Was not disappointed on how it performed. Played AAA titles on ultra with out a problem.
Awesome machine. It runs beautifully. And the timing for delivery was absolutely spot on
great laptop,very happy with my order, came with the hdd kit upgrade(!!)
Computer randomly turns off without warning after having it for less than a month and support was unable to help with it.
Great computer! Has served me well.
good for gaming.good for casual use.
Just arrived and it looks pretty good. But it turns out it's the one with gtx1050 ti, but just 1050.
It is a great laptop and for the money its simply awesome. I bought it for school work and some occasional gaming (I know it's more of a gaming laptop but I prefer more graphics than no graphics ;) ). I personally am not a huge gamer, so I allowed my brother to check for fps and stuff. He was getting 60-65 fps on Rainbow Six Siege on medium setting all around and about 30 fps on extremely high settings. I have been using the laptop for a couple of hours now and it feels great and runs smooth. I will update my ratings if something goes wrong (hoping it won't).There is however one big flaw: The track pad feels just awful. Thankfully I had ordered a mouse beforehand so its not a issue for me.Edit: after an entire semester of coding classes, I am extremely happy with the performance. For gaming part, it gets hot after about half an hour of heavy gaming but works fine with lower end gaming and school work.
Great computer, for a budget gaming laptop I'm very impressed
Very well balanced at this price range, laptop starts really fast thanks to SSD.
Everything as expected. Great Deal. I read in some other review that this laptop has 1050 instead of 1050ti.In my case I got everything as described. Happy with the purchase.
The product is as described. Great specs for the money.
Had high hopes for this laptop. I knew there would be some heat issues as a lot of people have pointed out but I looked past that since I could buy a cooling pad for it. Build is good, was actually a bit impressed. M.2 was super fast on booting. Played Rocket league and PUBG very well. However, it started to turn off randomly.. I had it for a week before that started happening. The weird thing was that it only happened when I was running on battery. Will be returning this laptop...
All the specs are there! Awesome laptop!
Son loves this computer!!
Great computer
great value and works well
Very good
When it works it works well, but that rarely every happens. From day one a faced terrible battery issues, audio problems, fan problems and screen tearing issues that make it unusable that can't be fixed by vsync. I am probably going to return this laptop and not get another. 2 stars becuase when it functions it works really well.
Hey everyone....this laptop rocks....it is seriously awesome! I don't understand what other users are moaning about. I've read through other comments before buying and some were complaining about it being noisy, or too hot....I've experienced nothing like it. After playing fornite for 3 hours straight the laptop is barely even warm.....far from hot....the fan is on but it is very quiet....I,ve set the game setting to "epic" quality and still getting easy 60 frames per second. The HD is definitely NVME....super fast...the laptop boots in 5 seconds....I am vey happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it!
Only bad thing is that the battery shuts off randomly when unplugged....and by the time you find out....you can't return it. Very light, screen somehow broke with light handling. I have had many laptops that were more durable where the screen never broke. For the price, it shouldn't be so flimsy. Acer support team is incompetent. This was my first & last Acer product. Go with a Dell or Toshiba or HP or something.
I saw NDIVIA GeForce 1050 ti on descriptionAnd now i got laptop and it has NDIVIA GeForce 1050???? What's wrong with my laptop?
Works as advertised, bought it for my brother, and overall its running as it should. Some reviews made note that they got the 1050 instead of the 1050ti, but this one came with the -ti variant as displayed. His only issue with the computer is that the games dont run as well of the charger as they do on it, and that the headphone jack for this laptop is extremely loose. Not sure if poor quality or faulty, but regardless its a downside to buying this.
Acer Biom are not smooth and stable, had to update it to Insyde Software. Graphic cards and stuff runs great on ultra settings, but started lagging when playing 8-bit games. Which is weird and I don't understand. Probably it's a faulty laptop or It's just Acer. The more I use it, the more problems occur, which gets really annoying. So I have no choice, but to refund it and find a better gaming laptop brand instead.
Great Laptop, but I received the GTX 1050 instead of the GTX 1050ti. The GTX 1050 is just not good enough.
It's a good computer it's fast and plays my high end games with no real lag I love the fact they nailed the heat issue with free flowing vents I was surprised when I looked at it and was happy too see that heat is a number one thing that kills computers
If it is not plugged in, it will spontaneously go to sleep every few minutes. Is anyone else facing this problem?
I love this thing. The best laptop I've ever owned.
So far so good. It came as advertised gtx 1050ti. Battery life is prettt bad. No gaming and light use, I was needing a charge after 2 hours. I paid for one day shipping and Amazon botched it. Seen it coming too,and questioned them on it,but they assured me it was on schedule. They took care of it of course.
Very Good laptop
Had it for 2 months and so far so good. Plays older games on max settings and newer ones and medium to high with no issues at 60 fps. Really good budget gaming rig. Will update a bit farther down the line when I have had it longer but so far so good!
I wonât buy this ever again. It ran great , and over the last week the speakers have crackled and popped and now itâs running so slow and getting stuck. No viruses or anything found.
Returned. Case felt cheap and absolutely hated the trackpad. If those two features don't bother you, it's a solid purchase.
This machine is really fast, and it does run games nicely. What I do NOT like, is the keyboard. The back lighting is not easy to see, and if it is running on battery, the keyboard turns off completely. Virtually impossible to see the letters in the dark. I would also appreciate being able to change the color from red to almost any other color. I erroneously thought it might be configurable, but alas, you are stuck with red. Very nice screen, and the sound is pretty good, too. Very solid feeling. Very good cooling capability, as well.
Laptop arrived damaged - screen distorted/pixels broken. VERY upset.
Beautiful graphics, but small on memory size. My son has to delete a game each time he installs a new one.
it is 1050, not 1050 Ti.product received is not what you expected.hope someone from Acer can explain this
Right after the package came it went down to 50 bucks less wtf
Good laptop for the price.
awwwwwwsommmeee laptop
good great excellent
Works swell so far.
Love it runs good
I have now had this laptop for three days and I am already having massive audio issues from the built-in speakers. The lack of dedicated mouse buttons also hurt the precision with which I am able to click on anything, particularly if I'd like to right-click.It's not the worst machine I've owned, but feels definitely less than advertised.
not bad laptop, the battery is crap though. fully charged i went just an hour on the web and the battery is about to die. have to leave it plugged in to use it.
Runs as advertised but had to reset windows 10 and needed to look at outside website to find the the key buttons to access repair mode for windows 10. Itâs good for 1080p but 15 in screen not like any higher resolution is necessary.Acer needs better instruction manual. It plays fine just laptop fan to keep it cool. First laptop bought in 9 years
Good laptop for basic gamers. This is not for pro gamers who plays online game like Rainbow six siege. I would prefer Acer Predator over Nitro 5 which is around $200 more.
i bought this. it's just 1050
There's something wrong with system, you might need to resetting the PC after you first time installed the Windows. Over all is pretty good, laptop is pretty fast.
Product not as described. Like others, I received a GTX 1050, not a GTX 1050 Ti graphics card.
Bought this computer this month got it the first week of March and the screen is already cracked. I'm not sure what happened but I have only used it a couple of times and this happens. I'm not sure what to do. It's not very usable with a cracked screen and it cost too much money to just get another computer. I've had several computers and never had a screen crack!
pricey but ok
Iâm not a gamer or hobby level computer engineer. This wonât be that kind of review.I am a tactile person. I appreciate how things look and feel. I enjoy the feel of quality design, and construction.First let me say I enjoy the aesthetic of this computer. The brushed metal with a matt black, and red accents is both interesting and exciting. This will be the primary computer for my 11 year old. He loves gaming, and graphic design. He is currently working on a comic book, and I know he will make great use of this computer for his creations.I absolutely loved the setup. This is a windows machine. I have not set up a windows machine in years. We have mostly used iPads and iPhones for most of the last decade. Iâve purchased and set up many of those. They are simple for sure, but this windows machine made setup interesting. Now maybe that says more about windows than Acer, but itâs included. I enjoyed it. So itâs in the review.Why was the setup so interesting? Cortanna. The whole set up was voice controlled. She spoke, I answered, and she did the setup. I felt like I was at a pro desk, having a knowledgeable customer service rep set it up for me.The screen has a matte finish, and feels a little plasticy. This may be a side effect from coming from iPads, which have glass screens. But I think I do prefer the look of glass. I do think the matte finish helps reduce glare. So this computer would likely, literally shine, out doors. Itâs a bit big, in my view, to be easily portable. But Iâm sure kids and teens lug these around. I prefer the iPhone 7 Plus for portability. Anything bigger than an iPad mini is staying at home.The machine attaches to WiFi quickly and easily, and with stability. Thanks to google, most of my settings were there after setup and google log in.The back lit keyboard is a neat feature. The keyboard itâs self provides a nice tactile experience. Key strokes feel fluid, and smooth. The keys feel more rubber or silicone, than plastic. Their motion seems to have been intentionally engineered for a positive user experience.The hardware inside is sufficient for any computer tasks I threw at it. I had numerous windows open at once, everything from shopping, to video streaming, to audio streaming. No hiccups, or glitches.
Right off let me say I'm really impressed with this laptop. Here are my thoughts:FORM FACTOR: This laptop is intended for gaming, so while it's definitely portable it's bigger and heavier than a general-use laptop. The case is really attractive; I love the brushed-aluminum look, and the unit overall looks sharp and slightly aggressive without looking gaudy, although the case does attract fingerprints. Overall the unit feels solid and well built.DISPLAY: I really like the display. Despite being an IPS display the color and clarity looked great to me, although you do need to view the screen from directly in front for best quality. The screen size and resolution are absolutely perfect; it's nice and sharp with great pixel density but not so much that you have to use Windows' clunky scaling feature.KEYBOARD: The keyboard is not bad. Key travel is good and it was comfortable to type on. I like that it has a keypad. The one thing I didn't like is that the keys are black with dark-red lettering. This is fine with the keyboard backlight is on, but if you're running on battery and the backlight is off it's nearly impossible to see what's printed on the keys. This can be a problem even if you know your way around a keyboard since a lot of the keys are smaller and closer-spaced than a full-size keyboard.TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is what I would call middle of the road. Not great but it gets the job done. If you're going to be doing any kind of gaming you should absolutely have an external mouse.SOUND: The audio is the one thing that really surprised me--it's fantastic, the best I've ever heard from a laptop, and even better than some desktop speakers I've used. The sound is nice and full and doesn't have that thin "AM radio" sound that a lot of laptops have. The stereo separation when you're sitting in front of the computer is terrific as well.PERFORMANCE: I knew the specs were pretty good before using the laptop and it didn't disappoint. I was able to run a bunch of my favorite games just fine, including some CPU/GPU intensive ones. As long as you're not the kind of person that needs to have every graphics-quality slider at maximum this laptop gets the job done. I will say when the computer is running full tilt the case fan spins like crazy and is quite loud, but this is pretty typical for laptops. When the computer is not running full tilt it's fairly quiet.CONCLUSION: This is a great budget gaming laptop and represents a fantastic value. It feels solid and well built, looks nice, and performs great for gaming on a budget.
Got this Feb 21st no audio device installed??
My daughterâs HP laptop started giving up the ghost and she needed a replacement fairly quickly. I have had great luck with Acer laptops in the past so I thought I would try the Acer Nitro 5.My first impression is that this laptop was a bit bigger and heavier than most of the laptops I have purchased in recent years. The casing feels to be mostly of plastic. While it is solid and sturdy feeling, it does give it a bit of a cheap feeling.My daughter mainly uses the PC for academics and light gaming. For this, the PC has performed superbly.The only thing I thought was just OK was the sound quality. I know that laptops generally do not have good sound quality, but I thought the speakers and sound in this laptop were a bit mediocre. The sound was not terrible, but it sure was not excellent either.Personally, I loved the HD screen on this PC. The light up keyboard is a nice touch I thought. Battery life runs about 5 to 6 hours with surfing and online use.After about 6 months of use, the laptop is still running like a champ. I have yet to encounter an issue.Overall, I have been very happy with this laptop. I would highly recommend this latptop for someone looking for a good laptop at a good price.
Got this laptop from Costco. This has a 1050 with 4 gb of vram. Basically the 1050 time has a little bit more cuda core than the 1050. This has the 1050 chip in it with 4 gb of vram instead of 2. I don't care as it plays games great. The one issue I have is the control key. It's way to short for gaming. There's a full size one on the other side of the keyboard but not on the left. If they just switched the fn key to the other side where the Volume and brightness keys are then it would have been fine
Using 3 generations of iMac at home for the last 12 years, I was reluctant to get a PC laptop. However, my work gave me a Dell with a solid state drive and i7 processor and in many ways, including its quick boot-up, it was more appealing than my iMac at home. Additionally, to get equal specs of solid state drive in a Mac, you have to spend double. So for a home laptop, the Acer Nitro 5, with an i5 processor, seemed like enough for my casual needs: writing on Google docs, surfing net, and watching movies on Netflix.Taking the Nitro out of the box, it looks with its 15.6-inch screen like a large laptop, big enough to be a desktop replacement. It is a very attractive laptop--modern, solid, and red-light keys that light up as you type. This is not a touch screen, but the touch-pad can give you a lot of the touch screen experience with the various two-finger swipes.Set-up was about 15 minutes as you enter your data into the Microsoft system. For me, the most desirable user experience is to do my work on Google Chrome, use Google Docs, and use all the same bookmarks from that browser. The Acer Nitro seems very capable and moves as quickly as my i7 Dell.A word about sound: On Netflix, the Dolby speaker sound is excellent; however, the sound was tinny on Spotify. Probably, the old jazz recording didn't sound well on Spotify. Probably better recordings would sound better though the speakers.For the aforementioned purposes, this Nitro i5 suits my purposes and is a very pleasant user experience. If you do more applications and need a workhorse for a laptop PC, I recommend an i7 processor with 512 GB SSD and 16 GB RAM, but for my purposes, the Nitro 5 has everything I need. Recommended.
I got mine from Costco for $599 - overall itâs a really sweet laptop for the price. I dropped an $140 to add 8gb of ram for 16gb total and a 1tb external hard drive. I mostly will use this for video and picture editing despite what some have said is not the most color accurate monitor in the world. Itâs good enough for my needs. I plan to pick up an additional 2tb internal drive for another $80 or so bucks. For the price, I think itâs the only laptop under 1k to have a 4gb 1050 graphics card. The Costco version does not come with the ti but it does have the quick access panels for adding the ram and hard drive and the hard drive tray built in.
I got this laptop from Costco about 3 months ago. Performance wise, this laptop is a killer for the price (I got mine for $649). Even though I have the lower power 1050 (not 1050 Ti) version, it still gets 1080p 60+fps on modern games, with high (but usually not ultra) graphics settings. Concerns about thermal throttling are mostly unfounded. Even while playing games that max out my computer's performance, temperatures never go above about 80C (hot but not enough to damage hardware) and I don't experience FPS drops, but it does get loud and warm to the touch.Its build quality feels like a typical $600-$700 laptop - sturdy but not premium. There isn't too much flexing and no creaking, but I've had some subtle clicking noises from the touchpad that sound like something loose. Those are gone now. The plastic on the top gets scratched easily, and the entire laptop attracts fingerprints. The keyboard's individual keys don't feel very nice, but surprisingly gave a very nice typing experience. It gets 6 hours of battery of very light usage, 4 hours of heavier browsing. I haven't tried playing games on battery. The screen is not really bright enough to use near direct sunlight, but does fine in the shade. Turn the brightness down for much better battery life. The screen's colors are okay, just a cheap IPS screen.The laptop comes with lots of bloatware from the factory. What I found most annoying was that the power button was controlled by Acer's software. Once I uninstalled all of it, the power button only can shut down and turn on the computer. There is a keyboard shortcut to sleep, though. The computer also has no physical indication of whether Caps Lock is on, that was also shown by the bloatware.Other stuff: webcam is average, speakers are average, keyboard lighting is nice, has 3 usb and 1 usb-c (no thunderbolt) plus RJ45 ethernet and headset jack, nice angled power connector, is not too thick or heavy. Mine didn't come with a cable to upgrade the hard drive. 256GB is enough for general usage, but you can't install large games.Overall, though, this is a great laptop in the "value gaming laptop" market, and well worth your money.
Have had it for a month, it works relatively alright . The speakers which sometimes spaz out and need a restart to be fixed, or they're just way too low for some reason (at random). The touchscreen has gotten wonky sometimes and the heating... Oh God the heating. It's gotten hot from drawing on Photoshop and playing indie games. Cooling systems aren't a recommendation but a necessity for this machine. Acer could have fixed the heating and I wouldn't really complain about the rest tbh.
I used to wonder why anyone would need to spend more than $200 on a laptop (or $139 for the fully functional laptop that I got at a Thanksgiving day sale a couple of years ago). And I still think that, if you are on a very tight budget, that is the way to go. But if you can afford it, these gaming laptops really do give you better performance and better experience. It is not always that you get a faster CPU (although the CPU may have improved functionality that is not always revealed by the clock speed), sometimes you are also getting significantly better graphics and sound cards/chips or more cached memory. And this Acer Nitro laptop does have all that with a really beautiful screen all packaged up in a sleek case.We are not using this machine for gaming (although I ran a few gaming benchmark tests like Heaven and was impressed at the brilliant graphics and speed and heat management) but the improved performance, like fast screen updating, works just fine for non-gaming users.You get NO HARD DISK but you do get 256 gigs of SSD and that certainly performs faster than a hard disk. I have to say that I still like my computers to come with a hard disk and Acer will provide you with the necessary hardware to insert your own disk drive. For now, I have no desire to open up and look inside this machine - instead I salvaged a fairly new 2-terabyte Firecuda sata drive from a desktop that I retired - stuck the drive in an external USB 3.0 drive enclosure. My external drive works just fine - I cannot boot from it but why would I want to when I can boot from the SSD. If you want your laptop to be really portable, you will probably want to use an internal drive rather than an external one.
Hands down the BEST DEAL in budget gaming laptop. A genuine quad core i5 processor, gtx 1050Ti, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, for only 700 bucks? Expect this beast to run any triple A titles on medium settings @1080p with a solid 60 frames per second.
The information provided by the seller is unreliable, since this device is completed with GTX1050, not GTX1050Ti !
I received the laptop with the gtx 1050 and not the gtx 1050 ti. currently waiting for a response from the seller about this issue. Besides that it runs great and handels all the games i play on max settings around 60fps, cs-go, league of legends, rocket league and overwatch. Will continue to update after further testing.
This laptop has given me nothing but headaches and problems. It gives bluescreen of death ever since the first bootup. Amazon support is not helpful, the seller is nonresponsive, and acer support is garbage. Stay clear of ANY Acer product!
runs pubg at 70 fps on medium settings, fortnite 70 fps on high
Perfect thanks a lot
I am not a gamer, but needed a laptop as I am mostly a Mac user, but my company uses PCs. This Laptop is very fast, comes with Windows 10 loaded and little else. That gave me the ability to add the software I wanted. Most of my software comes from subscription services and they loaded quickly and easily.The keyboard took getting used to as it lights up in red, but at night or in the early AM when I want to do some stealth computer work, it really lights up the keyboard so I can work in low or no light.While it is not lightweight, it is light for the size and very sleek. The resolution is awesome and better than any other PC I have used. (Most recently Lenovo and IBM Thinkpad). It is sharp and wonderful for viewing photos and other graphics. The color is true too.I am new to Windows 10 and am getting emails on how to work that. I've been a Windows 7 user. Windows 10 is like a poor man's version of Apple's newest OS system, but that does not detract from this powerful PC.The price is the best thing. Very reasonable for what you get.
Very nice. :D
Very happy with this comparatively inexpensive laptop. Inexpensive when compared to other souped up gamer models. This has more juice than I would have expected for the price. The display is nice, the speed is better than I had anticipated (so far). The hard driver is not huge and an inexpensive external hard drive would make a perfect complement to this purchase.
They lowered the price right after I bought it. No Matter what they would not refund my $50 back. I could have went with a gift card as well.And about the product. DON'T BUY IT. The battery barely runs for 3.5 hours if you use it lightly with better battery mode. On high performance it will die in 2 hour. If you play games it will die in less than an hour and half. Very bad battery. Slow responsive. Pc runs at over 50% for something simple like browsing the net. Wifi gets disconnected for a second in every 30-45 mins. I had search the net like a mad man to fix it, then gave up completely rebooted the new pc. Then it got fixed. Went through extra hassle for that. The customer service just told me to update the drivers, which it was already updates. They don't know anything. Clueless employees. I like the Screen and built quality I guess.I am never buying anything from Amazon ever again.
everything is perfect except the track pad. the track pad has some quarks but besides the I love this thing!!! PS. not the best for hard core gaming.
This came so good when I wanted to play my games because I have about 10 games on it and it's able to hold all of those because it has so many gb.
BEWARE!!!!!!!This does not come with the cable to install a second drive, I have been trying to get one for weeks now. They have hung up on me 7 times already.Also this computer gets really hot and the keyboard key will start sticking. Acer has the worst costumer support I have ever seen.
The lap top Doesnât came with HD memory,,, thatâs crazyJust remember that , if you buy need HD memory
Does this come with the HDD kit? If i purchase this i will want to add 1TB HDD but a lot of reviews are saying it doesnt have the SATA cable to attach the HDD to, and that you have to contact acer support to have it sent to you... anyone delt with this yet?
Where should I startThe keyboard is very hard for typing The back lit in red is hard to see the letters and the registering the product is a joke I tryed for over an hour with no successWill return ASAP
There are pros and cons to the latptop.CONS:There really isn't a lot of memory, so I wouldn't recommend saving anything to the hard drive (use an SD card or USB). I had only 6 GB available out of 29 (I'm going to see if there's anything I can clean up or bypass so I can get some additional memory here).Runs slowly (likely due to memory).Does NOT come with MS Office installed. It formerly had it installed but it doesn't have it installed now.PROS:My laptop came in GREAT shape (no dings or anything).I'm a student and MS Office can be utilized online for free though my school, so I don't *HAVE* to download it (but I'm clearing up memory and I'm going to).Overall: I think it'll get the job done. I'm a college student and a busy mom of three. While it's slower than my desktop, I think after a little adjusting, it'll get the job done. It'd be nice if it had more memory and I didn't have to adjust it myself, but you get what you pay for.
The computer is really nice, just needs a sd card to help it function better. Before or after purchasing buy a sd card to ensure you are able to add music and pics. The wifi picks up incredibly and Cortana is always there to provide help. I highly recommend purchasing this product
The Stream is a pretty decent laptop for college students running on a tight budget. It's good for casual web surfing, playing media such as videos and music, schoolwork, and can even play some light gaming (League of Legends on extremely low settings). The only drawbacks I found since buying this in August was the storage space and mousepad. The internal memory goes up to 32GB and since it runs on Windows 10 there are updates that will take up the storage pretty quick. Also, the mousepad can be unresponsive and sluggish when moving the mouse around the screen. To solve these issues, you can either buy a microSD card (it can go up to 64GB) and insert it in the small slot on the right side, or delete some factory apps that are pre-installed on the Stream to save space, and buy a mouse (either USB wired/wireless) to make the best out of the Stream. Overall, I found the Stream to be an awesome buy for its price. It's not the best laptop nor a bad laptop but it definitely gets the job done.
I purchased this laptop for my daughter because of the size and how it was advertised. She needed a smaller laptop to carry around on campus. It's lightweight and serves the purpose for her needs. It was clean, easy to get started and easy to navigate. Having Windows 10 and Office 2016 already installed was a big plus. My only issue with this laptop is that space seems to be limited on the hard drive. A lot of the space appears to be used by the OS. With every Windows 10 update, more space is consumed. The "running out of space" error messages constantly appear. I would think that a 32 gig hard drive is more than enough space. Other than that, it's fast, has good connectivity, good screen resolution and is easy to carry.
I deal a lot with Laptops, was expecting so much more from this little guy but the processor is absolutely garbage. No matter how many times you run a disc clean up, cc cleaner, etc that won't stop the processor from giving a 100 percent usage all the time. Don't even bother uninstalling apps to speed it up, I removed all the useless apps, but the Processor is always having a hard time, and lags constantly. The worst part is that every 20 minutes the screen has a quick 0.5 second crash! The touch-pad is also terrible, a wireless mouse is needed at all times.
Great product at a fantastic price! Doesn't have enough storage for full Office functionality, but it's great as an internet computer.
This works great. Exactly what I needed. Small, lightweight, and powerful enough to run Google apps smoothly on Chrome.
The main problem is the 32 G, I was not even able to update Windows 10 because I had no space on C drive.
I am a full time working college student who is always on the Go. This works exactly what I need it for, great battery, small and easy to carry around, internet use and typing papers. We all know what we are paying, don't expect a lot of memory, lightning speed kind of thing. This is nice, simple, effective.
It's hard to buy HP Stream Flagship Laptop in such a low price, not to mention that has Intel Celeron Core up to 2.48GHz, 4GB RAM, 32GB SSD which could let me run all kinds of basic programming that I need. I'd rather 11.6" than big screen because this keyboard distributes suitable space without leaving too much for my hands and also portable well. Just run it for now, the display is great without spot and everything looks smooth, nice shot!
Item is fine. However, one came with an incorrect power plug, itâs a usb C, instead of the hp plug on the rest. I communicated this to the vendor the day of receipt, I would like the correct power cord and have not received an answer or replacement!!?!!
Would not set up for me, returning. Seems well made and should be fine if setup worked!
Quick shipping. Laptop was packaged very well for shipping. Arrived in perfect shape. My son will LOVE this. It's very quick to get setup and the Wi-Fi is lightning fast. I had zero problems setting it up.
Worked great for less than a day. Continued to randomly turn off. By the 2nd day it would turn on but nothing would come after the loading screen. Stuck staring at a blank black screen. Returned day 3 of owning.
Resolution kind of a bummer but it's a nice little lap top to take to work meetings.
A purchased it for my wife's birthday. We love it .
It was way too slow for me. I had to return it.
It crashed and burned within two months :(
I bought this for my 9 year old sons birthday. He used it for 2 minutes. Some times it is better to spend the extra money to get a better product. It will not even turn on. It just idles on the sign in screen. ð¢worst.purchase.ever.
Arrived perfectly! It did arrive later than expected and had some minor dirt on it, but overall, it is in great condition.
Donât waste your time. This computer has a faulty screen. Software wasnât reset. Has other persons info in it; including the ms office key. Spend the extra 40 bucks and get a new one.
Seemed good at first. Not enough memory for Windows updates. I really liked this laptop but the finger/mouse pad worked iratically. Eventually went to blue screen and stopped working. Returning it to amazon.
excellent product... great service thanks
The computer memory is used up pretty fast by the windows update. It runs okay while online.
Good for travel. Not much memory.
Great device but damn! Glad i bought an external HD. All the initial Windows updates take up 99% of the storage.
Product is very slow and doesnt have much memory
I found this cheaply made. It has a solid casing but the mouse finger pad is loose and doesn't work half the time. Also works backwards compared to others. It crashed/ froze everytime I turned it on. I returned it two days after I opened it. Part of it is Windows 10, compared to Chrome it is slow and takes up too much memory for basic functions.
I purchase on amazon almost every day and this is the first poor review I am leaving. I was so excited to like this laptop, I love the color, it's super light weight and portable. But upon first use I noticed that it was dead on arrival, which is odd in my opinion, especially if it was "certified refurbished" and checked prior to shipment. I thought it may just be a random glitch and overlooked it. The slow speed I could not over look then the snow screen became more regular...after not even a week of having it in my possession. I expect a full refund and if not then I will go directly to Amazon.
it is a good laptop for this price.
Great laptop. Does everything I need it to do. Very slim and lightweight
value for money
This laptop was everything I had hoped for and it is incredibly packed with features for anywhere near the price. Since I'm a Prime member, it arrived in two days flat. Nice! The packaging and shipping was excellent, the laptop box itself is packed in its slim cardboard packing with a perfect fit and then packed in an outer box as well. Absolutely no damage, dents or bruises at all. AC Adapter and minimal documentation included (no media). There's really nothing else needed, it appears to have one of the newer kinds of battery that's internal and not user changeable, and it charges well. On the initial screens you can choose to turn OFF all the slide controls that offer to send info to Microsoft. (recommended).One thing you have to be prepared for due to Windows 10, is that as soon as you reach the place where you give it whatever means of internet connection you use - it takes over and begins the update cycle. The large 3GB Windows 10 ver 1709 takes some patience, so just let it do it's thing and give it as much as several hours. You want to make sure that it's all up to date first before you go in and tweek things. So don't begin that process until you can spare several hours, and you'll be in good shape.It came with what I'd call minimal bloatware. Some folks want that stuff, I did not. I uninstalled xbox gaming, MS Store, an eBay shortcut and several other items I had no use for. The 30-day eval of MS Office wasn't going to do me any good so I uninstalled that as well. Less than 10 minutes lost to cleanup - no problem. Looking at the add/remove programs listing in the Control Panel, you can see it comes with the usual nice collection of Acer utilities, so don't remove those. And when you do finish the installation and have it configured just the way you want, take the time to do a Windows Image backup to an external USB drive, along with a Restore DVD, that's your very best means of recovery later on if you ever crash your drive.This is a very well-made laptop and the best by far of any of the several former Acer laptops I've owned in the past. Sturdy, powerful, loaded with all the latest and fastest ports, (you have to love the 802.11ac WiFi, it's a screamer) - along with a 1TB drive, plenty of RAM and expandable to a whopping 32GB - it's a great buy and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone wanting high performance in a low-cost package. Everyone has their preferences, true - but I give this model 5 stars for Amazon's packing, shipping, and Acer's very best product line yet. And I'm an IT Professional of some 24 years, so I get my hands on some very top-dollar laptops for business. I think you'll be pleased with this one!
I loved it! I'm using it for Video editing, Auto cad, Photoshop, playing online games, watching UHD movies and internet browsing!For me it's fast! and the shipping as well! didn't expected it to be so fast. Well packaged, it came to me safe and sound!Overall, I'm so happy with it and the service! Thanks so much!
I bought this as an upgrade replacement to a seven year-old Acer laptop and I'm not disappointed. The amount of manufacturer-install cruft was minimal - I had all the sales junk uninstalled in under an hour - and the SSD drive means it boots in seconds.My only complaints are that A. they made some questionable choices about the keyboard layout (the DEL / HOME / END combo got moved around to make way for a POWER button? Why on Earth?) and B. the exact same model is available for $400 from Acer's website minus the SSD, which is < $100 here on Amazon. So I ended up paying a $100 premium to have someone else to do the SSD drive and Windows install for me. I'm not overly broken up about that.
Pros- Overall pretty fast performance mode is about 3.5 GHZRuns games smoothlyCONs the battery drains insanely fast.Will sometimes lag too much for an i7
I bought two of these to replace some aged laptops. I was worried because of price and there not my normal vendor. I have to say I love these laptops. I replaced the spinning rust with and SSD from my old laptops to save money. Reinstalled Windows and away we go. I have to say I like the touch pad on these more than my Macbook Pro. Normally I hate touch pads but I used it to setup the laptop. The real test if the wife and kids would like them. I keep checking in with them to see what they think and they said they like or love them as well. My daughter is like I can play all my games on max settings which the old one couldn't do. I have to give ACER a big thumbs up because my family really enjoys these laptops.
This laptop is a reasonable price but its still not worth it. I should have sent it back right from the start but thought I would hang in there with it. I am on a 400 mps wifi with a router that supports up to 600 and I am barely squeaking out 120 in the same room as the router. All other laptops (HP) have no issues reaching over 300. It is extremely slow and half the time will not process links even with pop up blocker off. Buy a better machine, I wish I did.
It was running slow when I received it. I had to set windows up to store everything but the system on the second hard drive, and it slowed down even more. Once I formatted the 1tb hard drive and reinstalled windows it has been running like a champ. It boots in about 15 seconds from completely shut off, and it runs fast. It is upgradeable to Solid State Hard drives all around, so I will probably upgrade the hard drives in this computer.
Very timely shipping, received in great shape and worked right out of the box with no issues to report.wife was thrilled with her new laptop. Definitely would buy another one if I needed to.
Works great and is fast. I would buy again.
I bought this strictly as a Sims 3 & 4 gaming laptop. It is perfect for both games with over 30GB of CC and Mods used, HQ settings on both games with no lag at all.
love this one, quick and truly the most bang for your buck
Laptop arrived, and is fast. I play Sims 4, City Skylines on it. They run fine in highest settings. It's a good deal.
I have onlly had this a month but I love it.. It is smooth and very fast and the screen is fantastic. I would tell anyone shopping for something like this to go for this one.. Priced right and has all the credentials of a great laptop.
works great
after 7 days mouse pad stopped working. called acer tech support to no avail. Returned.
EXCELLENT LAPTOP
Did not realize it did not have the capability to use cd.
THIS laptop is excelente for my home use. Has everything I espected and need. Wood recomend .
Poor instructions or no instructions. Always trying to sell add ons.
Very slow for the i-7 processor. I guess, you get what you pay for.
Geat laptop
Great vendor, terrible laptop. What good is all that CPU and RAM if the hard drive is so slow? It was intolerable - i returned it. I think this would be a great laptop if you wanted to sink another couple hundred for a SSD and void the warranty but I didnât. Found one with same specs and SSD online elsewhere for just a little more.
I had some issues when it came out of the box. It isn't updated to the latest windows so it needs to be updated
Package came on time due to being a prime member. Package was neat. Laptop is terrible. Turned it on and plugged it in and had to wait 3.5 hours for it to update. Used it for about an hour or so after waiting Hours for it to be done updating, BOOM, mouse pad stopped working. Horrible horrible
This laptop seems to work fine, usually powers up fast, was relatively easy to setup and use, and generally just works. It does NOT come with a CD/DVD drive, so expect to spend another $20-50 for a plug in variety if you need one. This laptop does come with a lot of bloatware and I am still working to remove the non-essentials. Overall it feels a little on the cheap (flimsy side) relative to an HP laptop I have at the office, but for light use at home and as a back up to my almost new Dell all-in-one with a dead motherboard, it's fine. Packaging was very poor. There was very little material to cushion the laptop box so it knocked around a lot inside the shipping box, and the shipping box arrived damaged. It appears the laptop was undamaged, but I am a little worried that something will show up later.
This is a nice machine. It is speedy and has good display. I would have appreciated a user manual already loaded on disk but I had to hunt for one on the Acer website. The trackpad seems over sensitive but I haven't looked for an adjustment within Windows.Overall, I recommend this PC.BTW, it came on time and was well packaged.
husband very satisfied with laptop
I ordered two LaptopsLaptops are ok butI'm not sure that is brand new because the secure sticker on box was broken on both laptops.
The keyboard doesnt light up and i dont like that
The perfect laptop.
Its a pretty good laptop so far. Reloading (to get rid of the Bloat...) seems to take a really long time but that is windows and not a hit on the laptop. So far its nice for the price....and the DVD...its real not fake....so who ever said that was full of it.
Easy to operate.
The laptop can run small programs like chrome, YouTube, Netflix, etc. But it can not run big games. Mine doesn't even lock when I close the screen and the fan can be very loud and it sounds like the radioactive detecting sound. I would not recommend because the graphics card is what kills the performance and so does the bad motherboard.
The computer, the speed is great. But I despise windows 10. Also, I have returned it because it advertises a CD/DVD writer, but it not only does not have a writer, but does not come with a DVD or CD player. I have a ton of software that I have to load onto it, that comes with CDs/DVDs so after spending days setting it up with my preferences, I begin to install software only to learn that I don't have a DVD/CD rom. Also, Windows 10 forces you to create an account to log in with. It is annoying.
Do not buy this computer. Hours spent trying to update windows 10 and still not fixed. Between Acer and Microsoft this has been a huge waste of time. Customer support for both have been incompetent.
I ordered this laptop and noticed it was running slower than it should, so I had a certified and licensed technician check it out. Turns out, the motherboard was bad, so I sent it back and asked for a replacement which couldnât be done, they could only send me a refund and I could reorder. By the time everything was done, I had my refund, and I was ready to reorder, the price for the laptop had gone up by $30. I called customer service and asked if there was anything that could be done since it was a problem that came right out of the manufacturer, and because I really did want this laptop, they said no because itâs being sold by a third party and there is no way for me to speak to the manufacturer directly as I have checked. Upon further inspection, this isnât even the same laptop that I had originally ordered. The specs have been slightly altered, there is no longer a SSD in this laptop, and itâs overall just lower quality than the laptop I wanted. So, in the end, I regret ever even considering spending money on this laptop and you shouldnât either.
It came, and the laptop runs great, but the thing on the side that looks like a cd rom is not. Its a dummy.
Was easy to set up, especially for a tech-challenged old man. I was expecting a half-inch thick instruction book but it's all done interactively. You power it up and follow the prompts. It took a half day to load everything; you have to be patient. It serves all my needs, shopping banking, etc. I don't do games or movies on it so I can't comment on its capabilities there. The default browser is Microsoft Edge; I managed to change it to IE11 which is easier for me. For the money, you can't go wrong. If you're like me you won't be disappointed.
If I could give something NO STARS I wouldâve. Worst laptop Iâve seen since the 90âs. Slow to load . Non responsive, everything you do NOT WANT in a laptop. And by the way ITS NOT RED ITS ORANGE. Go find something else if you read this review.
Laptop sucks. Updates and loads extra slow. It took 22 hours for my laptop to download and install all windows updates. Laptop never connects to my wifi and my laptop battery drains faster than it should because it's trying so hard to connect to the wifi. It will connect for a minute and disconnect but it will show that it's still connected to my wifi. I bought an Ethernet cable but I don't want an Ethernet cable to my laptop. I should've just got a desktop computer I guess. The point of a laptop is to take it around with you, not sitting on your desk hooked to an Ethernet cable because it can't connect to WiFi. I've had this laptop for about two weeks and I've only used it once because it was hooked to an Ethernet cable. Other times I've tried it without the Ethernet cable and it doesn't work. Waste of money if you ask me.
I am a student who purchased this Ideapad to use specifically for paper writing and research for school. I did not have really high expectations about browsing speed etc. Alas though, I have had it for maybe a month and during this time it has frozen at least weekly to the point of manual restart, it connects/disconnects to the internet constantly making research take so much longer than it should as I have to constantly refresh the pages until it decides it wants to connect. I know the problem is not my internet as my phone and ipad remain connected.
is a nice laptop but seems slow and batt does not last a long time and is not replaceable by you.
The computer is slow when I which YouTube and download show thing.
Was bought for a birthday gift...
Great laptop
light weight works very well. Pleased with this purchase.
Great computer great price ..delivered early
This was a replacement for another Chromebook so the performance was as expected eg. excellent. What pleasantly surprised me , because I hadn't given it any thought , was that all my sites were there complete with remembered passwords. Chromebooks are the best buy for the buck.
i have had about 4 laptops int he past 10 years -after my last one i decided to get a chromebook simply because i do not like windowsi got this today and really expected to spend the night trying to figure this out-much to my surprise it took me less than 2 minutes to get it set up and running it doesnt take long to power up and get online like my hp and i love it only problem i wouldsay is it has no dvd drive but i am ok with that i wanted a basic computer that is simple to use and i got one -couldnt be happier
I will tell you this is a great buy.I can not believe the price and the product is great.I am so happy with my decision on this purchase.It moves very fast and adding external usb drive works fine .Thanks for a good deal.
I have to start off by saying that I'm a Chromebook fan. I've tested several and owned a few. There are still apps (when I was growing up, we called them "programs" and "software") that will only run on a PC, but I try when possible to take a Chromebook with me wherever I go because they are just so damn handy. Why is this important? Because this review is not here to hate on Chromebooks. They are great little machines. Many reviews hate the OS, and don't focus on the hardware when writing their reviews.Unfortunately, this 2017 Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6" HD "Premium Chromebook" is not really "premium." For two Benjamins, it's still a better computer than NASA had for all the Apollo missions-- in the space crafts and on the ground combined. But I was expecting more. I have a 2015 Asus 10" Chromebook which outperforms this 2017 15" Chromebook, and they were both the same price. I was hoping to "trade-up" but it looks like I'll keep the mini Chromebook and just use this 15" Chromebook as a spare at the office.My Chromebook arrived refurbished, and I knew that going in when I purchased it. But sadly, mine arrived with schmutz all over the case (mainly on the bottom, and along the sides). The screen and keyboard were (thankfully) clean. But the rest of the case was honestly gross. We're talking about dirt, skin oils, and maybe food stains. I don't know what. Someone should have wiped this down with a rag before shipping it. It was absolutely disgusting to receive it with visible stains and foreign material on it.The screen quality is decent-enough. Technically, it may be "HD," but it doesn't pop with color and brightness like many other HD screens. Reading emails, the text is kind of soft and fuzzy compared to my Asus PC latpop screen and Asus 10" Chromebook. I'd give the Acer 15" screen a 7/10 in the visual department. Again, not bad for the price, but certainly not up-to-par with other laptop screens we're now seeing.The speakers are awesome. Not only are they of good quality, but they face up! Frankly, it should be international law that all laptops have upward facing speakers so that we can actually hear them.The keyboard is excellent. Feels pro-quality, and it's not too loud (some cheap laptops have a clickity-clack problem). Could use this on a plane in first class and not disturb the blue-blood next to you with his poodle and monocle.Where this Chromebook really fails is in power. Now, I'm not expecting Cray Supercomputer here (have I dated myself yet?), but I was disappointed when I tried to run 4k video from YouTube. It was a complete no-go. Not entirely unexpected, but I was hoping a "premium" Chromebook could handle it. What's more disappointing is that it hiccuped a bit even on 1080 HD video from YouTube. That's no bueno. I tried watching a couple videos on this Chromebook and compared it to my PC, and the Chromebook just didn't have the mojo or gusto or eye of the tiger.In summary, this Chromebook is a good value overall, but it's far from premium. For the price, it's a worthy contended, But if you like to watch HD Netflix or other streaming film, I think I'd look for another laptop of Chromebook with better video capabilities.UPDATE: The day this refurbished model was delivered, I noticed that Walmart had brand new ones for less money. I'll be returning this used model.
I purchased this for my wife to use in the Master's program she has started. She was frustrated by our old computer, and this works like a breeze. The Chromebook OS lets her have immediate start-up, while our Office 365 account allows her to use a full host of Microsoft products online, if she needs something outside the Google products. She had been extremely pleased and wished she would have purchased a Chromebook years ago.
I bought these, specifically, for my 4 kids whom I homeschool. I didn't want anything outlandishly expensive; just very basic. Something they can do their schoolwork on, typing courses, etc. This computer totally fits the bill. The screen is big, the keyboard is great, and even though it doesn't have too many bells and whistles, this is perfect for our needs. And the price?! YOU BETCHA. Totally satisfied with our purchase.
I wanted to get a laptop for my stepdad because his was infected with so many different things that it didn't work properly anymore. So, when I saw this I couldn't believe my luck at the amazing price! I got it in the mail yesterday and set it up for him so it would be ready when he got home from work. It runs so smooth;y that I couldn't believe it! It answers commands immediately, the display color is fantastic, it has great speakers, he can use a regular mouse on it, and SO many other things! I'm EXTREMELY happy with this purchase, and my stepdad was even happier. THANKS GUYS!
Great deal - Great Chromebook! Arrived today and booted up instantly with great performance. I was up and running in minutes. For the price its perfect for my school classes and budget. The display is HUGE and clear for my needs. Its a NON-GLOSS display and perfect for all the basics. Good keyboard and soft touch keys. It also has plenty of room to rest your palm so thats nice but I always use an external mouse. I never had a Chromebook and was surprised there is NO Delete Key. I looked over and over and NO delete key. I find that when you Right Click you can delete stuff. I thought it was listed as Black its really a Dark Charcoal Grey which I love even more! Professional packing and all.
Excellent Alternative to Windows PCs...FINALLY!!! New, this is around $300, mine is "Refurbished" for $188. And if it holds up which I think it will, I am walking away from Microsoft with their never ending PROBLEMS and BUGGY PRODUCTS. One thing, Chromebooks don't have DVD/CD Drives or Hard Drives (a Negative and a Positive) but they offer abundant Cloud Storage (a Positive and a Negative). No Drives means very few moving parts to break and very little heat to dissipate...I don't think they even have fans! Well, I am willing to spend $188 to test out this alternative path from MS which I have been searching for for years, Chromebooks have no Operating System other than the Chrome Browser. Google provides lifetime Free Virus Protection, An Entire Suite of Office Apps called Google Docs (no Outlook or MS Works needed...YAY!) plus Hundreds more Apps at No Charge! Try it, You'll Like it.
So far, very happy with this Chromebook. For my daughter, for college. Very different than a Windows-based computer, but not too hard to figure out (And there is LOTS off online help and tutorials!) Would certainly recommend!
Refurbished, really.Can't tell, looks great, sounds great and works perfect. I have to admit this is my first Chrome book, alittle different. Not like my android phone and not like my Microsoft Surface, so there will be a learning curve. So far so good.Update: damm, the price went $50.00. Goto walmart you can get a brand new one for $179.00
My girlfriend loves it! Big screen, decent speakers on the sides, USB ports, easy to use, great price. Only con is the touchpad isn't the greatest, but with all the pros this Chromebook has, can't even complain that much.
As a student, im not exactly rolling in money but needed a laptop for school so a Chromebook was a given. This product shipped on time, had no visible scratches and the cheapest i have found and has had no problems in these first few weeks. The only thing thats not quite as good as i wanted (given the price isn't a big deal at all) is just the track pad is a bit finicky. all being said is a solid product and i wasn't even able to tell it was refurbished.
I bought my first Acer Chromebook several years ago and loved it. I thought that I'd try another one but a larger one when the keyboard on my older, smaller model wore out (keys just stopped working). So I bought this. It's just ok. The battery life is good but I expected it to work faster than it does because it's supposed to have a faster processor speed. Occasionally, the machine slows down to a crawl and I'm not sure why. My biggest concerns: the quality of the machine and the price. There is a line that runs across the screen. I didn't notice it at first but there's a line that runs from one side of the screen to the other. It's more noticeable with the machine off than on but it upsets me that a refurbished unit would have the line. The other thing is that the overall feel of the machine is one of cheapness. My older machine was a solid little thing -- the new machine feels cheap. When I open the machine, the plastic creaks like it's not stuck together (glued? screwed?) properly. I also purchased the machine for a reasonable price then in the greatest Amazon tradition, the price dropped significantly. I requested a price match but was denied since the machine I bought came from one seller and the same machine for the less expensive price was from a different seller. I would not buy this machine again but would look for something different. Although the battery life seems better than my older, smaller machine, that's the only positive thing I see with this machine.
Iâm highly impressed with this laptop! The price is unbeatable and the computer itself works flawlessly considering it is Certified Refurbished
It was a gift for senior citizens. They had it working in minutes from unboxing.Looks like good value 5 stars.Delivery was as advertised even when hurricanes raging last week.Much easier to start up than typical pc.
I didn't have a problem with this machine until right after the 30 day return window expired. I have been having technical issues shortly after. I would get black lines running across my screen, the machine would freeze. I would have to do a reboot. I then received a message to reinstall the operating system. I was able to do that successfully. Once I did that, I did a powerwash just in case. My machine was once again functional...for about 3 hours. Since that time, this has happened a total of 5 times. I've even contacted technical support (ACER)...they were able to help me get up and running the second time, but it still keeps happening. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a product seller. I will not buy an ACER product ever again due to this experience and have bought Chromebooks from other manufacturers as gifts and they are still up and running for years.
9/29/17 Update: After using this for awhile I wish the keyboard had a "Delete" key. No issues though.This was my first chromebook and I am pleased. Exactly what I need for a great price. Setup was easy.
I purchased this for a friend and now I'm jealous. I love the Chrome platform and I would get one myself if I could get one equipped with a much larger hard drive. I currently use the Chrome browser in my Windows 10 laptop. It's super quick and a lot more reliable.Update: 2 weeks later. Still running like a champ. My friend went to this from a 7" tablet because, well, we're all getting older and the eyes don't see as good as before. Bigger screen, easy to see. This is more or less a large tablet with a keyboard. I like the fact that we didn't need to get any security software to protect it, Google seems to have that under control
I was in the market for a Chromebook to do my school work on as an educator and not break my pocketbook purchasing it. This one fit the bill. So far so good. I have been using it daily, numerous times a day for over a month now. It is a great laptop for my educational classroom needs.
I was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of this Acer .the size is perfect and the screen is clear.I will purchase2017 Acer Flagship CB3-532 15.6" HD Premium Chromebook - Intel Dual-Core Celeron N3060 up to 2.48GHz, 2GB RAM, 16GB SSD, Wireless AC, Bluetooth, HDMI, USB 3.0, Webcam, Chrome OS (Certified Refurbishd)Â another for picture storage.
This is a good computer for what it is, and what it is is a Chromebook. That means it is a laptop running Googleâs Chrome OS. The operating system is fast and very user friendly.One thing that people will complain about is the amount of space that the laptop comes with. Itâs about 15gb. Before you freak out about that, let me explain WHY the storage is so small. Chromebooks use what are called web apps. That means you donât need to (or more accurately, canât) download programs. That being said, donât expect to be downloading games and movies.The battery life is about 12 hours (unless you use the computer the way I do. Iâll explain later)The camera looks good, albeit slightly grainy. Well, when itâs not skipping frames.With the main focus being on web apps, that would mean that you have to be online constantly to make the most use of the laptop. There are of course, a few offline comparable apps that you can find in the Chrome Web Store if you ever find yourself without connection.If you want to unlock the full potential (and very quickly run up your memory) you can take advantage of the fact that ChromeOS is Linux based and install Ubuntu. I wonât get into that, just simply explain that itâs possible.For your money, it is a good machine and I actually enjoy using it.
I give this 5 stars.First, it's only very inexpensive computer. But what you get in screen size and keyboard is very good for the money. I bought this for my church to do QuickBooks Online software. It looks like this was a wise decision since we do not need any onboard storage (computer has some though). I am impressed with the speed and screen brightness. I have watched movies and videos online without problems.I think I may buy one for my family to use. It is solid and does not have any loose or poorly fitting parts, but it is not as solidly built as a MacBook, but what can you expect for 1/5 fo the price. It is well worth the money I spent. If you have a kid or an older parent this should be a great computer for them because no Windows updates or virus software to fight or confuse the user. Be aware it is Google-centric and takes a google account to fully access all features.I have not tried games or anything like that on the computer but I am impressed with the machine compared to my daughter's Chromebook computer (3-4 years old), it's much snappier and the screen is much better in brightness and clarity.
the laptop or Chromebook I got it is old. this is not new, and also it has scratches and gaps in top of the notebook. I am really sad because it had good comments in the reviews. I am not able to return it because I do not have enough time. I will travel out of the country, but you will be careful because we are paying for good stuff.
My kids took over my other computers, so I decided to get one of my own. I enjoy the convenience of having a personal computer where all my passwords are mine, etc. This computer is sometimes a little slow, which was disappointing. But I suppose that it what I get with a dual-core. It doesn't have any other issues. I use it for email, social media, google docs and spreadsheets, calendar, YouTube, online shopping, and the like. I don't use it for gaming or music, so I can't say how it would do for that. It holds a charge very well!
Very satisfied with this. Up and working on it within minutes of opening the box.
This is exactly what I was looking for! Itâs ridiculously easy to set up and use! If you have a GMAIL account it seriously does all the work for you,just put in your email address adjust some settings and there ya go all done lolI didnât need a laptop for anything too extreme or specific,just wanted to have a place to type papers,listen to music and download pictures so this was perfect for all of that!The price was perfect for me right now too! It came packaged with bubble wrap and a secure box! Everything works on it and it did come with a charging cord ð
So far so good. I've had several Acer desk tops and have been very pleased with them.(My only misstep was the Acer Aspire 'All-in-One'. Nice computer but very limited to add-on resources.)This laptop is pretty new and have not used it a whole lot at this point.I added a $90.00 Crucial 8 GB memory (Now at 16 w. 32 capacity) - easy install and it works fine. I'm not putting a heavy load on the system or gaming - so it suits my needs as expected.I have a Acer desktop that is my primary computer. (the laptop is basically a 'fail safe') - but, with the added mobility and comparatively small footprint.Looks nice - keyboard feels solid. A little clumsy opening the cover - maybe because it is so new. (A bit stiff.) But that's not a big issue.Full HD images seem a little washed out - until you get the screen in just the right position.
This was my first time making a computer purchase on Amazon. Wasnt a big deal since it was for my kids to do homework and with such a reasonable price i figured why not. I was soooo amazed once I opened the package. The computer was refurbished but it looked brand spaking new to me! I the screen was nice and wide. I seriously wanted to give my children my laptop and keep this 1.This is definitely worth the buy! my daughter is headed to college an i will be making a purchase again to present as a graduation gift. Its not heavy or bulky, again its a great screen size and resolution, everything works as expected! Im really impressed and did i mention the price....very much worth it!
Excellent! Use it daily for my remote job. Functions fast and efficiently! Screen is large 15" with great graphics. In general "Love it!! "
This is my first chromebook and although I am still confused at how to get it to do some things that I've always done on Windows PC, I am impressed. This doesn't act like a refurbished item at all and is very fast. I like that it turns on automatically when I open it. The packaging was plain but very secure and my laptop came without a scatch! I saw some others say they hadn't gotten a charging cable but I think they just missed it. You have to dig all the way to the bottom of the box, where there is smaller piece of cardboard separating the charging cable from the rest of the packaging. I almost missed it myself and was worried I would have to return. Overall, I really like it even though I'm new to chromebook.
I like it because it is good for basic users.
The laptop is EXTREMELY fast, much better than I anticipated. I use it to do homework while watching TV, instead of using our desktop. It's a chromebook, but I search the internet faster than prior gaming laptops I've owned. The machine runs like a champ. This was one of the best purchases I've made in the past couple of years. You usually get what you pay for, but this is a bargain and a great machine.
My 10 yrs. old son love it. screen is so big and enough fast to process. I think it is very good for school kids to do their homework, net surfing and watching Youtube. and I don't feel it's refub product. Great price.
WARNING: my package came without the charging cord. When I asked Amazon to issue a credit so that I could buy a cord on its own they would not offer any solution other than return and refund of the entire item.
I was looking for something lightweight and fast. This is both of those. Going from a Windows OS to the Chrome OS was something I wasn't sure about. I've always used Windows, but I bought my 81 year old mom a Chromebook for Christmas, and she loves it. I figured if she can figure it out, I can too. Setup is simple and straightforward, just log into your Google account, if you have one. If not, you can create one.. I bought a flash drive for pics and files. I added my VPN, that setup was simple too. The price can't be beat, the screen looks awesome and text size can be modified. I'd definitely recommend this
It was a gift, they are very happy with their Acer... I though It was a regular laptop but it was what they call a tablet??? as long as they are happy I am happy!
I purchased two of these for my girls. They were perfect for the use they'll receive. Educational apps, learning how to navigate a computer, and of course YouTube and Netflix. The price was very competitive, especially considering that I was looking to purchase two. The delivery was also much faster than anticipated. Thanks seller, the girls loved them!
First time using chrome wanted windows 10 but haven't had to use my phone anymore and I no longer charge then since this helps me do everything I need at light speed! Been playing games on it non stop while streaming videos and it just blends if u multi tasking and are addicted to YouTube like myself....it's a powerful laptop for a Chromebook I've run multiple pages in HD videos streaming with very minimal lag (due to area of internet). But what I love the most is the charger which is very important as to how long ur laptop will last, not only is it super fast at charging but it is delicate and easy to plug in and it pops off as a safety mechanism I believe...either way it never overheats it charges really fast even during heavy use and it has options to really dim down the screen to save energy. It's like a tablet but you can do way more and run apps with easy... A must have if you like to entertain your family or others as the speakers on this babe are crisp and clear. It's also light and it comes with this cool bubble wrapping packaging that I've been using in between my lap and the laptop and for storage . My fav thing about this is it's taken over my use or cravings to even use a mobile or smartphone/iPhone which is only explained by how easy it is to get everything social media done on a Chromebook while I do plan to get a Dell that runs windows 10 this is really good to save ur other devices from the load social media and YouTube can out on a device built to run more complex programs. So get one for sure and forget about charging ur phone and looking like a boy who can out down his Gameboy lol jk
Love it. It runs fast, I can watch YouTube/Netflix no problem, the sound is decent, the screen is really big and it's easy to use. No caps key, but I quickly trained myself to hold shift down for a capital letter when necessary, which is often because I use this primarily for my online college classes. Does everything. Had an issue accessing a few web pages at first due to "privacy issues" but the problem fixed itself. Haven't met a webpage I cant load. Highly recommend.
I bought this to replace a 6 year old Samsung Chromebook which I have loved until it finally quit. This Acer is much bigger with its 15.6" screen. Right out of the box, as usual the setup was almost instant, and I love the feel of the keyboard. I saw a sticker saying to open from both ends to find cord, and it is hard to notice when you're excited to get the chromebook out of its packing. Don't throw the cord away! It was packed very well.So far I love it, and will update if I find it isn't what I thought, but I bought it for the price, size, and the fact that it was a Chromebook. Very impressed with the quality so far!
no good went to sleep and never woke up . worked a little while about a month
My first and probably last chromebook.1) Computer arrived in pretty much brand new looking finished. I easily could have mistook this for a new computer, except that it was still configured as a meeting chromebox and required Acer tech support troubleshoot the issue with me for an hour before being able to login to the computer.2) OS update allows me to use android apps on the computer. However, the two apps I use most crash every time i open them. So I'm back to accessing on them on the browser. I like my apps better, but apps don't work on this thing, despite what the OS description said. If you want to access an app or service, its done through your Chrome browser, not the androidapp.3) My biggest complaint about this computer is the keyboard. The genius who designed the keyboard put the SEARCH button directly to the left of the A key. Since there is no number pad, any experienced typer will have to reorient their typing stance from a center-left position to a dead-center position. Its extremely cumbersome using the keyboard despite its full size. Additionally putting the search button directly to the left of the A key is so annoying I'm actually considering prying the key off so I stop accidentally pressing it. If that search button wasnt in such a stupidly designed location, this would be a 3 star review.The main redeeming value of this computer, and only reason its not a 1 star review is the ease of use in terms of the Chrome OS. If you know chrome, you already know the computer. It would have been nice if the seller would have set the puter back to factory stats prior to mailing it. 1 hour of my life wasted troubleshooting that little mix up.
This is my first laptop/Chromebook. I am everything Google, so this works out perfectly! I use a desktop computer and my cell ph mostly, but needed something for downstairs which this works great. It came fully refurbished, clean. Their is 2 scratch marks barely noticeable on the casing, but other than that and for the price of under $150.00 I feel I got an awesome deal.
My daughter recently change schools and at their old school they needed Apple but at her new school she's used Chromebook. To get a Chromebook at this price is so worth it she is so excited and has no problem navigating through different websites. I'm absolutely buying another one for my sons. The seller was super nice and sent me an e-mail asking to rate the chrome book and if I have any problems email him which I thought it was very kind.
I bought this for my Partner to replace an older chromebook. She loves it.It set up easy and she seems to be really happy with it. I never thought about buying Refurbished, but now I'm sorry that I didn't do it before. I bought a new laptop at Best Buy and could have gotten a much better one that was refurbished for the price that I paid. Go REFURBISHED
This machine looks and performs flawlessly!I bought it for my father and he finally has a portable computing device for all his ?? Computing requirements! He had an old Dell desktop that performed slower than molasses in winter after his 8 years of email etc... he finally upgraded and LOVES this machine. I havenât gotten a âtech supportâ?call in weeksð
Extremely happy. It is light weight, very fast and has a long life battery. Well worth every penny and I was thinking about getting another because it is so portable. It does not have a dvd/cd player but for the price you can buy an external one.
Purchased for my son. Others had more features, but my son wanted a large screen and he was initially very happy. EXCEPT he says space bar does not work well. I wish he had let me buy him one with more RAM, more GB, SSDL --there were several available with a bit smaller screen. Had we gotten one of those, he would probably be happier. He recently told me, "A smaller screen would be ok." Unfortunately, as far as I know, it is too late for an exchange. I would be thrilled to purchase him a better one!
This laptop is NICE !Purchased this for my 9yr old son. Im honestly a bit jealous lol . Anyways it was delivered on it's given date, and today we went through the simple set up. He is very excited to have Google Play Store. Thanks for an awesome laptop !!
i had this for about 7 months and its still going strong. it hasn't broke down on me yet. i mainly use it to browse the web i don't make youtube videos or do heavy task ect.. so this is perfect for me. and if i want to play a game i go on my consoles and do that. i use to browse on my tablet alot but since i got this bad boy this killed my beloved tablet. if you want a buy a laptop without spending 500-1000 dollars(im looking at you apple!) go for a chromebook and its incredibly fast once you turned it on it only takes less then 3-2 minutes to turned on.
Excellent price. I know it was refurbished but you wouldn't know it. The package came with a very heavy bubble wrap, which protected the computer. The set up was plug and ready. I love this Chromebook is the best. I have had Asus chrome books and I feel that the Acer is the best. I love the large screen. I love it so much that I ordered another one for my husband. I would recommend this Acer to everyone. Easy to operate and fast. Also, don't forget that it has its own Antivirus build right in the computer.
I got this after returning another chromebook that felt flimsy and was so slow. The great part is I only paid $30 more for this one that has a bigger screen, solid construction, and fast processing. Buy it.
I love it, just having a hard time hooking it up to my printer. Can't understand what i'm supposed to do. Very complicated.
Laptop is great abd works well....but didnt recieve a power cord with it.....do i have to get my own? May have missed that in the fine print
Needed this laptop to stream online video to a weekly group. Works well and the picture is very clear. Well worth the price.
Bought this for my in-laws when their Windows laptop stopped working. Keeping the old laptop updated and virus/malware free was proving to be a challenge for them. They absolutely love the simplicity of this Chromebook. Getting a 15.6" at this price is a steal. Highly recommend for anyone who just needs a worry free machine to browse the internet.
For what I bought it for, it serves its purpose perfectly. I am very happy after using it for a week now. We had a Macbook Air and one of my humans spilled water on it. Game over. Couldn't afford another one so after doing some research this is a perfect band aid for a little picture management and Netflix watching. My daughter uses a Chromebook for her class so this was also a plus. Very budget friendly and we have a laptop again in the household.Update: About 2 weeks into computer , the charger went out. Charger would not charge computer. Uuuugh. Seller had no replacement for it. Remember this is a refurbished item. Be careful. Bought a new charger and is back to good. So computer works great, the process was the bummer.
I'm very happy with my purchase. The laptop came quickly and was well packaged. I was looking for straightforward laptop that wouldn't break the bank. Did some research on chromebooks and found they fit my needs (basic web surfing, simple documents). Went with this one because it hit all my marks. Setup was quick and easy, and the laptop has been everything I needed. Very happy with my purchase!
Received the chrome book, plugged it in and immediately noticed the charging port was slightly loose and to no surprise, the battery will not charge. Waste of time and money. Thankful for Amazon ' s return policy but will not purchase from this seller again
Cosmetically, this computer looks brand new and is so sleek! As far as functionality, even better. Connected to my printer in under 2 minutes and starts up and connects to sites quickly. Nice big screen and lightweight. Very happy with this purchase and for the price this is a great deal. Highly recommend.
great deal for the $ ,Nice Big screen,light weight,hdmi,great buy.
Works great came fast and the price you can't beat
I am glad that I purchased this laptop since it arrived in Mint condition and it works like a charm. I use laptops for my business and I thought to save some money while getting a Good deal. I did both with this purchase.
Still in transition from straight Microsoft. Printer interface awkward. Fast and bouncy Google browser Mouse interface is non-standard. Left click is reversed with right click. Still checking out many features.
I've has this chromebook for a little over a month now. When it arrived it looked brand new. I've had no issues with it and couldn't be more pleased. For the money you can't go wrong with this. Buy it now!
Nice and cheap and straightforward. Getz the job done. I am a grad student and mainly just write papers and do Internet research.
When my Mac decided to fritz out, I was in the midst of school projects and I needed a fast quality laptop replacement. This product is reasonably priced and it exceeds my expectations. No complaints whatsoever.
It's OK--I was disappointed that after just a few months the action on the touchpad would deteriorate to the point where we can't use it to scroll down anymore on the screen and have to use the arrow keys--the action was always a little "sticky" from the get-go but now, it's even worse. I get that this is second hand, but I was hoping for the mechanics to survive longer--luckily we can switch to a mouse--
A great bargain for a very useable computer. The keyboard and touchpad are really good for this price point, and the screen is fine. It's a bargain computer, and I feel like I got more than I paid for.
I'm a simple perfect, and this computer is perfect for me. I look at You tube videos, check e-mails, and college assignments. And with the 15.6" screen makes watching video a great experience. Although, the screen occasionally turns to black when you have a lot of tabs open at once, not a big issue for me, but it's a minor annoyance.
All around great, product, shipping, price. Thanks
One week in with the new chromebook and so far, so good! I bought the chromebook for a job that required me to have my own laptop. I wanted something lightweight to carry around. But most importantly I was looking to spend a little money as possible. The value for this is great! The 15.6" screen was a must for me since I will be doing so much work. The chromebook shipped fast and was packaged for maximum protection. This is a great investment!
Very happy with this. Packaging was super sturdy and the Chromebook like new. Easy to use and super simple to set up.
I'm using it now. Big screen. Nice sound. Solid machine,
Bought it for my brother. He absolutely loved it. It does everything that he needs. Would definitely recommend!
Awesome..great for the price. Has everything that you need.
Ordered it on the 17th and received it on the 22nd (once again 2 day shipping is non existent from Amazon).Setting it up now, so far so good.. first thing I noticed is this black refurbished Chromebook with the steel colored lid came with a white cord. (why?). My other Chromebook (Acer) died that I bought in 2016. I've been using an older Acer Chromebook I bought many yrs ago, small but has never given me a problem. Bought this one to use while waiting for a new hard drive on my newer Acer (bought in 2016)that's always been unstable and just died.So far this one seems nice.. i will update my review as time goes on since i just received it today. I haven't tried the speakers or the battery life yet.. I'll update this in a month or so after i see how everything works out, but for a refurbished product, right out of the box, i'm satisfied so far.Next day: This refurbished chromebook is supposed to have at least 7 hrs battery life. i"m happy to say I used it 9.5 hrs unplugged and the meter said I had almost 4 hours left of battery use. We'll see how that works out in the months to come.1/24 Battery continues to have long life but the meter is very irregular. One minute it says i have 7 hrs and 30 mins left, an hour later it says i have 10 hrs and 40 mins left, an hour later it says I have 8 hrs and 20 mins left - either way, so far, it is long (enough) battery life.*I'm not really happy with the lack of depth of color on this chromebook - it's supposed to be non-glare and that may be contributing to the issue i have with the lack of color.. there is no enhancer (1 app avail and does nothing) and these chromebooks have no settings for color.. this particular book, the color doesn't pop, has no depth.. very disappointing compared to my other 2 chromebooks.* Speakers are just ok - nothing to write home about but they do the basic job. My biggest issue with this chromebook is the lack of color depth.
Laptop came on time and (mostly) works as expected. There is a key on the keyboard (the apostrophe key) that works only on the second click which is odd. It was HELL trying to get some help with this small but bothersome issue. I simple, even small, gift certificate or money back option should have been offered.
Bought for my grandfather to do very basic tasks like email and basic web research. Serves the purpose well. Build quality is better than expected for the money. Screen quality is fairly good. Wireless range is good. Battery is great. Cheap enough that if he breaks it it's not a huge deal.
After not even 6 months of light to medium use my computer no longer works. The screen is all messed up. I would not reccomend.
Excellent product having no problems at all the kids love it. It's is just as promisedt I bought it for their schoolwork they already know how to use it, because it's just like what they have at school
Easy to use and convenient to carry.
I love this little machine. It does everything it said it would, and surprisingly, more. The battery lasts forever. I'm sure I will keep this great little machine around for a long time.
no complaints, ya get what ya pay for, private computer, internet access...what more could you ask for..product is awesome
Although this product is advertised as "Refurbished", I could not see any defects whatsoever! Looks and performs as a brand new product. Does exactly what I need it to do. Love It!
Good computer for my future, It has everything I need. It runs on Google Chrome OS like a cell phone and google provides virus protection. It links to my PC for printing until I upgrade to a Chromebook compatible printer. Long battery hours and light weight. I have been using it for a week and I love it.
Only 2 GB start-up...enough ffor me...with SSD storage 16 GB and all the space needed free in the cloud at Google Drive.Pre3fer to store nothing on board...laptop works faster.In any event down load Click n Clean...also apps to equalize and boost bass free. lots of free music on youtube..best deal for a 15 1/2 inch chromebook....anywhere now at amazon $186 after 9 price changes...so what
Exactly what I needed. I use a laptop for online work and my last one died on me. This is my first chromebook. I had went out and bought an 11 inch Chromebook from the store, came home and was disappointed by the screen size. Returned it and started looking on Amazon. Found this one for the same price as the 11 inch one so I was thrilled. I knew I needed a bigger screen. It seriously looks brand new and was packaged very well. Very fast for surfing which is basically all I need it for. My daughter likes to play online games on it as well. Super happy with it so far.
This laptop might be good for younger tech savvy people but for old people like me that just want a laptop to do their work and browse the internet, it is not for them. Everything is completely different about this thing and it is like relearning how to use a computer completely from scratch or worse actually. I tried to download pictures from an sd card and that was a complete nightmare. It was worse than slow. It would have taken atleast week to download 500 pics. This purchase was a complete mistake. I tried to give it a chance and figure it out but after a few days of almost zero progress and endless frustration I returned it.
Awesome product and great service!!! Highly recommend!!
Great computer! Great transaction! Would definitly buy again from these folks! Can't believe how affordable the Acer was and how much we like it....Chrome does everything we need.
Excellent value for the price! Works great and I'm very satisfied.
As this item was purchased as a gift, I didn't try it out myself beyond ensuring that it started up. It seems to be nicely suited to the tasks intended: email, some web browsing and maybe some kindle/video watching. It is light-weight enough to not encumber and the screen is large enough to view without undue strain or feeling a truncated sense of image.I don't know how it fares with travel conditions, nor how well it connects/streams data from sources other than home base at this time, but I have no reason to doubt that it will function as was described.The keyboard takes a little adjustment, as any would, for those coming from primarily desktop or smartphone input types, but it is still easier to utilize for arthritic hands than a tablet or phone pad.
Worked well right out of the box
Nice product, works very well AAAAAAAAAAA++++++++++++
We homeschool, and these are fantastic for it!
It was bigger than I thought which is great. This is the second chromebook I have so I wasn't amazed by all the features, but they WERE satisfactory. The speakers also work really well compared to my other chromebook. The packaging is probably what amazed me.....it came in a HUGE box that contained another box which contained a plastic bubble wrap thing that protected the chromebook. If I could buy this for someone as a present, I would. Overall, I like the chromebook and there isn't really anything that disappointed me. Also the chromebook is WAYYYY heavier than I expected.
Came in excellent condition looks amazing untouched, beautiful. I gave it 4/5 stars because it did not come with a charger
It has been a great replacement for a very old laptop computer. Perfect for my husband who is retired and only needs a computer to go online for news.
Laptop is like brand new. Simple to use. No issues so far. I love it.
The screen is big... but not really HD by any means. I am actually returning it because oddly enough, it feels like the keyboard is much smaller than a normal keyboard so I keep missing keys and have to spend time thinking about how to type on the smaller keyboard which is annoying. It could just be that the keys are tightly spaced and don't have any gaps like the other keyboards I've been used to typing on..
This is a good system for the price. However, out of the box it was very slow and lagged quite a bit compared to other 4g ram systems I have had. Increasing the ram to 8gb has helped considerably
Great laptop for most things you use a laptop for. Our refurbished one is like new and working great!
Great product, looks brand new and acts brand new even though it is refurbished.
Works easy right out of the box, updates automatically, a no-brainer purchase. Got it for my nearly 80-yr old parents, who are not computer savvy, and they had it figured out no sweat -- they use it for web surfing, emailing, and occasional letter writing and this chromebook fills the bill.
I was skeptical, due to the fact that this computer costs less than 250. My mindset was of the idea of "You get what you pay for."Well, color me surprised because I am blown away by this spicy Chromebook. It gives you the real estate of a full sized computer, with the speed and reliability of a Chromebook. It does better than my Asus laptop,with every advantage on paper. The battery is a hard A+ and these units show that Chromebooks have come a long way and have applications that prevent you from having to settle.I highly recommend it.
I bought one of these refurbished and it completely died after only 4 months of light use. I've emailed Acer twice now because it's still under warranty and no response. Even if it hadn't died, I would never buy another. They keyboard feels very cheap, the storage makes it barely usable and it's really heavy. I guess you get what you pay for.
Excellent purchase
Works great!!Battery lasts long. Enjoy checking my emails and facebook in my recliner!!
Works great and no issues... Perfect for our children!
Awesome........love it.
Very pleased with this purchase! I've always gone with Macs in the past because of the virus issue with PCs. Dont have to worry about those with this Chromebook and it does everything I need b/c I'm almost always on the cloud. Great buy, especially for the price
The battery life is crazy, it really goes all day. But it's lacking in processing power and the resolution takes a little to get used to. Webpages act a little strange, the headers sometimes take up massive chunks of the screen even when you scroll down. But it works well enough and you can do homework all day and hate your life while being productive. So that's...nice?
We are using two of these at our preschool. They are simple to set up and manage. They do everything we need. I plan to buy more like this.
This was purchased as a gift for my mother-in-law. The unit shipping quickly and arrived in good shape. It looks good on the refurbish (no scratches or markings) and seemed to work well for about the first month and then she started having problems with two of the keys on the keyboard sticking. It doesn't make it unusable, it's just frustrating to her, otherwise I would have given it five stars.
I love my new laptop. It's fast and super easy to use. I was really happy that it was packaged so nicely and that it was protected. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs this for either school work or just for general use.
The laptop came in good condition (as expected because it was refurbished). But the charger was defective. I plugged it in and the charging light wouldnât show. I called Acer support line and they said either the laptop or the charger might be defective. However, I went to Best Buy and purchased a new charger because I needed to use the laptop immediately. Now, the laptop is working perfectly and the new charger is great. The photo below shows the defective charger (in white) and the functional charger I purchased (in black).
I have not used the computer yet, so this review is strictly based upon my disappointment upon receipt of product. Although description clearly states that all relevant accessories are included, there is no power source cord included! I reached out to Amazon immediately and they offered a gift card for the cost to purchase one. However, I feel I should warn others about this scenario as it appears I am mot the first customer to experience this problem. After receiving the item, I read the questions asked area and see that others were just as frustrated as myself due to the lack of power source. The computer is meant to be a gift for my nephew and was requested specifically by him via Amazon link. My lesson learned... although a requested gift; READ EVERYTHING before purchase.
Poor screen resolution. Returned it.
Exactly what I was looking for! Turns on and is ready to go in seconds. Great display and very lightweight.
It was only good for surfing the web and doing personal document.. it is not compatible with a lot of thing couldnât download itunes or photoshop ect. Wouldnât recommended if you want more use of it!! Ps. the computer came with a scratch at the top.
Fantastic product. I already have given 3 of these to 3 of my daughter's and i got this one for my wife. Wish i came here first, i would have saved alot more money. They take a little getting used to but it is worth it for the kind of speed and protection they provide. My girls are completely thoughtless in what they download and these computers have proven to be impervious to this over the past 6 months.
Got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.
Gave to my daughter for Christmas 2017. My wife's choice, not mine over a PC. Almost impossible to get a Chrome book to print to our printer was the first problem noticed. Chrome book totally failed/died 5 months later while she was doing school work at her desk on May 26. Have emailed Hugo express and Acer support. We will see what happens.
love this Chrome book super user friendly !!
Bought this for my uncle you can't tell it's refurbished at all. It's very sleek and it's exactly what he will need so a really good buy and I got it very quickly because I'm an Amazon Prime member. Being a Amazon Prime member is worth the money
My latop gave up so I took a chance on this Chromebook. I absolutely love it. It is light, easy and fast. I like it so much that I bought my granddaughter the same one tonight for her online school.
Item works good for the first month then went down hill however it can work with just for normal task nothing too hard.
IT IS AMAZING!!!! I LOVE IT!!!! And its touchscreen! YAY!!!!!!!
Worked fine first 2-3 months, goes to sleep when I close lid and does not wake up. Having to restart every time. Disappointed with this purchase.
Not bad, My youngest son enjoys this laptop for his 5th grade school projects.
There is nothing wrong with the service, I love getting used tech for cheaper, I just knew that this was going to be a cheap Chromebook that I needed right this second. But it is so slow! It's killing me. I will probably buy another used laptop when I have money. I just hope I don't throw this hunk of junk before than.
Great screen size.
Good computer for the price
I did not know that chromebooks came in 15" size. I'm impressed! The ordered item was received very quickly! Thanks
I bought a refurbished unit and it works perfectly. I use it mainly to connect to the internet and work in the cloud. It has been problem free. The price was outstanding.
Perfect computer for what I need. Good quality.
Great laptop! My daughter chose it for college. She loves it.
Easy to use and setup. Simply input your name and email when prompted to, that's all it takes. This laptop is the same as using a chrome browser to access youtube and email.
Very nice computers however, we needed these units to complete PDF Fillable forms. Chrome is the only browser option available and is not compatible. These units needed to be returned & replaced with computers that support Internet Explorer. Buyer beware if this is your need as well.
I like the size of the screen, I can have abunch of open web pages plus see videos without problem. I am happy with it.
The chromebook itself is very nice. However, I'm baffled how you can sell a product like this without a power cord!! Not happy about this, at all!
Everything it was advertised to be.
It's great! Light! So easy to use, I bought it for my mother because she is technically challenged and she hasn't one bit of difficulty with it. Highly recommend!
First off, I read all the reviews. Some were good, some were bad. I thought that there were more good then bad so I decided to buy this. WORST MISTAKE EVER! The camera is busted. The ârefurbishedâ?is broken. They didnât fix it right. I contacted the seller, and as you can guess, IM STUCK WITH THIS AND NOW HAVE TO BUY A BRAND NEW LAPTOP. People donât care about warranties on their products
Love this laptop! Just got it today.Big screen. Fast. Easy to use docs and internet.So done with Windows
This laptop has been perfect! It was shipped in great condition, with no noticeable flaws. It is very fast, and the screen is an excellent size.
great value, bought this last year still going strong.
works perfectly.........
My kid loves it! She a junior in high school
Excellent device and an even more excellent price. Well packaged. I LOVE it
Can't go wrong with this purchase. Price is perfect too. I've had this for almost a year now and have no complaints so far. Battery life is great. Over 12 hours, couldn't ask for anything more.
Great purchase!
very happy, we now have two of this model in the family. r. letcher
This laptop is great! The only thing i have to say is that the memory space isnt the best. i suggest using an usb port to keep photos and or videos on. but over all great product and very easy to use.
Excellent product and very fast delivery!!
Works really well, love it!
I bought this for my children to use for their internet-based homework. I havenât been able to turn it on yet because it did NOT include a power cord. The description says it comes with all relevant accessories, but in my case that did not happen. Pretty disappointing. And no response from product support. This is my first time purchasing a refurbished product and will probably be my last.
I bought this for my Mom and it took some getting used to but it is streamlined well.
works well batt lasts really long
Great quality, large clear screen. Refurbished but can't tell the difference. Seems like brand new. Easy to use, my seven year old has her own profile with her own apps and can play and do homework on it. Packaging was amazing and shipping was quick. Great value
Very nice, smooth operation. Like it a lot.
Husband really likes it! He was using an old, slow laptop and he is amazed how speedy this is. It is just what he needs.
I gave it 2 start because it came with a damaged charger and I had to buy a separate one.
Great laptop for the price. Screen resolution not as good as a mac, but so what.
Large screen. Good quality for a refurbished product. Very good price.
Weâve enjoyed it so far with no problems! Battery lasts a nice time and it charges quickly!
the product is very used, and has many visible blows, which classifies it as class C. I feel very disappointed by the team, now I will have to spend a lot of money to place a case
Perfect for my father! very simple and very fast. will buy again!
It was a great and beautiful computer. It worked awesome, was so excited when I opened it. But unfortunately I made a mistake and didn't realize that it had wrong OS for what I needed. So I contacted company, made arrangements to send it back. Y'all made that easy and pleasant as well. Thank you. Received refund in timely manner w/ no problems.
Came packed well. It is very easy to get around. I would buy one again.
It works very well, the only thing I didn't like is there is a mark on the screen that is sometimes in the way. But as this is a refurbished computer you have to expect a few flaws.
So far so good! Wife loves this little powerhouse!
My space bar doesnt work very well have to press a few timesto get it to work also my right clock button on touch pad doesnt not work at all since i recieved my labtop.
I like the Chromebook, but sometimes the screen doesn't turn on even though the laptop is on. This has happened 3 times at this point in time. I purchased it a few months ago.It makes me feel like I bought something near the end of its life.
Excellent condition. Very snappy, fast boot, crazy battery life, everything I need. Home PC for gaming, laptop for work.
It's fine for work and light browsing of the internet. However, it is incredibly slow and often freezes when multiple tabs or open or you're watching Youtube or Netflix videos. Also chromebook is not the best OS as you cannot download certain things such as Steam, and it basically requires you to use Chrome or else it's useless.
Awesome computer
My wife loves this, wish it had a ten key other than that it works fairly well.
Works great, is easy to set up, and so worth the price! The speakers are wonderful and the keyboard is way to use! The only this is the screen is so slightly fuzzy but doesnât hurt your eyes at all! Iâd buy it again!
Bigger and better than we expected it to be.
OS is limiting but it works for everything google
great for the price! my dad loves it!
Great laptop for a great price. Fast processor, big screen.
This chrome book was exactly what I was looking for. So happy I went with the bigger chrome book as well!
was delivered fast! the transaction went smooth and as expected, the product works well. was a gift for my sister and she really is happy about it. Highly recommended!
They did not include a plug for the computer! It's useless and my only option is to return it or buy a plug???!!!! Insane
Love it. Should have bought 2 instead of the HP 15 inch bought at thesame time for twice as much.
The machine is great. However thereâs a learning curve if youâre not familiar with chrome
It was way too heavy. Otherwise is was excellent.
Arrived quickly, as promised. No problems.
Programming is difficult to navigate..... more like a tablet then laptop
So far so good. Was packaged well and works great. No issues and hope it stays that way :)
I am very happy with our new laptop. It is lighter than I thought and arrived on time and well packed. We had a chrome book before but it was smaller. This is larger and has a bigger screen but without the weight. Very satisfied!
happy, easy so needed
Nice laptop works great
Computer was exactly as pictured and in pristine shape. Got it for my dad for Christmas and he loves it.
Works very well. Prompt shipping. Very happy with purchase.
Fast shipping. So far the computer is great! My teenager uses it daily for everything.
the only thing I liked about this "laptop" was its size.Its start up menu was not easily accessible.It constantly shut down while I was in the middle of working on something, sometimes as quickly as 2-3 minutes after I logged on. It would shut down at least 2-3 times in a row.If you are use to a computer with a start up menu and icons easily seen and understood, this is NOT for you.
old and big
I bought the laptop as a present and my son loves it.
It's a decent laptop
From day one the computer ran slower than my 5 year old desktop. Oh and Chrome OS? Maybe for children but let's be serious...Windows 10 is a must.
So far so good...
I bought this so I could write wherever, and not just in my study. It's the size and weight I expected, i like it.
It serves its purpose of a laptop for my kids to complete homework assignments. No bells and whistles, but for the price, I am very pleased.
Excellent Quality
Big, beautiful screen.
fits my needs, works well
Great product !
Arrived fast, if you're looking for better quality as far as webcam and camera then you'd be better served buying something else. I don't use it for much so it's good for what I got it for.
delivered as advertised
For being 130 (at time of purchase) this laptop is amazing! I love it! Itâs large, gets the job done! Of course I added a laptop cover because I found the grey to be boring.
Solid chrome book
Screen freezes up to much!
The computer itself was nice and in great shape. But I did not like the Chrome part of it. I am so use to Windows all my life, I was more frustrated with it.
Great price! Great battery life, pleased with purchase. Thanks!
The computer is great. It is fast and we can do what we need to do. Thank you
This was the second refurbished chromebook I bought on Amazon, after returning the first. This should have been my first. It's great!
Great service. Good laptop. Good sound and images. I'd recommend Dave and his products and service!
Kind of annoying it didnt come with a charger and its completely dead, other than that i like it
Perfect for my 12 year old middle schooler!
Great computer. Perfect for what I need. I was pleasantly surprised.
A good value for the price. Easy to set up and use.
Great iteam
I like the bigger screen.
5 stars for sure! The Chromebook was in excellent condition. It started up right out of the box fully charged. I was able to use it immediately, and it's the best value for your money!! I will definitely buy again from this seller if we need another one.
working great
I love my Acer flagship. It is just like a mini laptop. I wish that the keyboard attachment would be a little sturdier and it can be a little difficult operating the mouse pad on the keyboard. But overall it works for my needs and the price was good!!
Excellent chromebook laptop. The best part about it is how quickly it loads up and how fast it is in general. Really happy with it.
I purchased this laptop computer for my 36 year old son in law for early Fathers day present he said he loves it and it works great!
Hooks up easy with house
For the price works excellent....
Destroyed my laptop but was using Chrome. Got this. Had it set up instantly and I am a luddite. Great screen and EXCELLENT sound!!!!
I'm very happy with this Chromebook. Exactly what I needed to pay bills online and shop!
love this purchase
My fist laptop, it has a pretty good battery life. I use it mainly for surfing the web and writing papers. Love it.
It's OK... Good size, decent speakers, but the colors are so amazingly dull, and the viewing angle is very narrow.
the chrome os has crashed twice in the past 6 weeks. first time i simply turned it on and off. now it wont do anything. i went through the chrome os recovery utility and still no good. can i get any help?
I thought the Acer would be a little smaller than the laptop I already have. However, they are the same size, so I am returning it.
Shipped well packaged, looks brand new !
Very lightweight, easy to use, great battery life, still getting used to only having chrome options
I just started college and needed something easily portable and reliable. Itâs perfect for what I needed! Light weight and works perfectly.
good product
Amazing product at a terrific price delivered very quickly !
My Fiance loves it and he uses it everyday.
While I did not purchase this chromebook for my own personal use, I did check it out to make sure everything was in good, working order and it definitely was! Very fast and easy to operate! Would definitely order again!
I really like this chrome book it is super easy to use and setup. There are a lot of apps to choose from also. I have not found anything I donât like about it.
This was a gift for my niece. She loves it.
I got the Chromebooks in the mail and they worked nicely. I got exactly what I was anticipating based on my order.
Completely satisfied with my purchase. Works and looks brand new!
I thought it was touch screen. I swear that I read a review saying it was, but maybe that review was in the wrong place. Itâs okay for the price. It lags sometimes.
i love my computer but would like to have instructions on my new keyboard! amazon did leave my "box" out in the yard instead of on our porch, which in tenn.can and will get rained on!
great product
Good Quality
Good quality but a couple of buttons stop working after a month of use
i like the chrome it fast idont know that thereis anything i like least
I am loving the laptop so far. Have not had problems yet so Iâm truly happy about that.
Chrome is the pnly way to go
Fast computer and gorgeous looking too. I love everything about it.
good price very good tablet
Thank you so much I am so happy about my package it works perfectly...
Has completely stopped working
Excellent product- a good bang for ones buck when one wishes for a reliable computer without spending or charging a great deal of money.
Great all my needs were met !
Walked for one month then stopped.
I purchased this Chromebook for online classes primarily. I already utilized google apps and programs prior when I had an android phone. You can't download any kind of software or anything to it, which is why there's so little space on the hard drive. It's not necessary. You do get up to 100GB of storage space on your google drive for a year or two though. For school purposes, I use Office Online since I can't download the actual software to the computer, and it works pretty much just the same. I also use it for facebook, email, shopping, etc.. It can definitely be a tiny bit slow if you're trying to look at a ton of stuff at once. I had to disable the autoplay on my facebook so it doesn't play the videos automatically and slow it down. But all in all, this does exactly what I purchased it for. I have a regular laptop if I need any additional processing power or storage space.The laptop may be refurbished, but it came in perfect condition. No scratches or dents, and no issues with the way it runs at all.
This chromebook has great functionality.
Excellent product and seller
Very fast delivery! Love my new laptop. Thanks
good value
Very good unit for the price
It was a gift!
Bought it for a friend and he said it works great
For the price this is an excellent laptop. Ran smooth the second I opened it and is perfect for what I need it for
The laptop works fine, but it came with a broken charger. I had to spend another $55 to get a new one.
I bought it for my daughter for Christmas
I bought this for my mother in law to bring her into the digital world. She and I are very happy with this product and the service given by Blazing Prices.
Got to love giving a Christmas gift to your child that stops working after 20 minutes. Thanks Acer.
Slow useless junk, a complete waste of my money.
While having used it a short time, it is performing flawlessly! Arrived packaged safely and unit looked and worked great from the start.
Great starter for grandson
Good solid product for my daughter to use.
So far we love this we love how easy it is to use it and the speed it has the only down side is it dont have a lot of memory
The 7 secons boot ap time
This is a very good computer and for someone who utilizes google, this computer is perfect and a major upgrade over the one I had before.
It is running like new! Thanks!
I don't usually right product reviews, this Acer Chromebook deserves one. Received it yesterday, easy setup, very happy with performance. Love the 15.6" screen that's the reason for purchasing it along with the price. Just retired the laptop that was heavy on my lap it ran out of disk space, did not want to fix it. Usually just use this for surfing the internet and reading emails. Perfect !!!!
Perfect for school work.
Five star for sure! I'm impressed with my chromebook! I would 100% recommend this to anyone! Could I advertise this on my website?
Quick to start but slow on some more processor intense operations. Excellent value for the money I paid for it.
working fine, all I expected ,time will tell
computer for dad. very simple to use. you do need a gmail account, which he has.
Exactly what I needed for web browsing and email. Screen is huge and crystal clear. Love it!!!
Still finding my way around on it but overall it is really nice. Only drawback is that I cant use my Big Fish games account on this computer. I love their games and have had this account for abt ten or twelve years
Easy to use. Large screen.
It has as been just over a week and the Chromebook is still running fast. It was clean when it arrived.
I didn't get a a charger with my orderI'm not if that's just how they do things but I felt it was worth saying
I love this chromebook so far. It's very light, the price was right. Very satisfied
Terrible lap top for school. Donât waste your money.
The price was right! I got this for my graddaughterâs birthday and she loves it. Works great, no issues. Thank you!
Only used it once so far.
My mistake that I didnât read and wouldâve known it was not touch screen but its a good computer
I am very pleased with my purchase, I must admit I was very concerned since t was a refurbished modeled I am well pleased.
I love this new laptop, it does ever thing I want it to do.
Love its big screen, good battery capacity, and clarity too.
I couldn't believe how awesome this computer is. It came in GREAT condition, looked brand new.
Also, the computer box seal that states it should be unopened when received was open and cut.
Great experience with the Seller. Happy with the product so far.
Good. Especially to be refurbished, but the computer freezes every now and then
Great product excellent price and lightning fast delivery.Highly recommend seller.
very nice
Love this laptop great price
The product was as promised and is fantastic!
Got this as a gift for my husband. He loved it and it works good as new!
she likes it so I do too
As advertised
Did not come with charger.
Works exactly like I hoped!
Wow, after 30+ years in the IT development and support industry, I found building a Linux kernel, and building a laptop from scratch easier than figuring out how to set a passphrase in Chrome. The Chrome help is a nightmare, and I think operating system and general google changes invalidates most of the advice that one can find online. I am pretty frustrated. Sound worked out of the box, but then, by waving my hand or something, it stopped working. Also sync won't work, and I can find no way to put in a "passhrase". All the "helps" are not helpful, because the Icons, words or whatever "they" say to click on, AREN' THERE! (software changes?)Unless you have more patience than Job, or nothing else to do for a month or so. don't try a chromebook.
Exactly what I needed
Just as described and fast shipping! Very happy!
Everything was perfect..been performing like new. No issues!
Very nice quality, works well. Very pleased.
Who sells a computer with NO POWER CORD ???
I am very satisfied with my purchase.
It was great. Super fast but do ur research to see if chrome OS is for you
Just what I expexted.
Works like brand new!!!
Works and looks great!
If you expect a Windows type operating system you will NOT find it here. This was totally alien to me. I could not get it to recognize my mouse, external storage device, and had to have a converter to attach the communication line because Wi-Fi doesn't work in my back room. I sent this back and luckily was able to get my old computer to work again. It sure made my old one look good.
Works great, cheap, clean, would recommend.
It was a gift, and it was in pristine condition. Booted up immediately, looked fantastic, and was extremely well packed.
got laptop march 1,2018.laptop inoperable may5,2018. I contacted acer refurb center by phone ,experience like calling Social Security office,after long hold I was instructed to leave message .Almost 2 weeks now and no response from Acer. Amazon should not do buisiness with unreliable companies like them. Thinking about cancelling Amazon subscription.Have paid over $200,for laptop with extended warranty,and got no service at all.I purchased Dell laptop from Amazon 3 years ago still works perfect,except for weak battery.I AM forced to use old laptop.
Love itðð
Easy set up. Quality product.
Completely happy with my buy
Product arrived as promised.
Cannot even go on amazon with this laptop cannot go on facebook will not be able to play steam games im writing this review via phone chrome os is garbage do not buy.1 hour laterOut standing it has now frozen shut non responsive. Not blaming the over all producer i think i just got a sub par one
We purchased 3 of these for our company and couldn't be happier. We have a web based training program for some of our employees and these fit the bill perfectly. They are surprisingly fast and easy to use. And, because they are all tied to one google account, when we make changes to one, the changes are reflected on the others. A great product at a great price!
Its working fine .the battery last long and the viewing is clear .I really love the Acer flagship .Fr. V.R.G
Bought it for my wife. She loves it. She only uses the web anyway so it worked for her. No longer does she have hacker software crawling all over her machine. She loves the size, and keyboard. She uses a usb mouse.
I figured for $200 it wouldnât be great but what I didnât predict was it barely works. Drops internet during any download, can only store 1 movie and the drive becomes âcritically lowâ?and most web pages stutter. This includes trying to use google documents which means typing a page stutters so much itâs not possible to use. I returned after a couple days.
It's good, not what I was looking for, I could not hook up my printer to it.
I bought this a month ago thinking it would solve our computing problems. It doesn't. Our printer works with our other computer. It will not work with the Chromebook. I downloaded 2 apps and they loaded. I downloaded 4 more apps and they are not there. I called Acer and they said it is a common problem but I have to pay to fix it. I expected a computer that works well . This is not it.
Nice chromebook does surfing, bills ect in snap and the bigger monitor is a +. My biggest complaint is the weight it feels like a regular laptop with all the hardware and the micro SD card doesn't insert all the way only half so you don't really want to. Store it with the card. Other than that it's working good for the price it's a nice addition to my electronics.
this laptop, are very slow, the processor cant not work with 2 apps open at the same time.. if you have youtube app, and open facebook its so slow and you can hear how to the audio stop, and the apps close automatic...other issue is with the wireless card, is really bad!,
This is amazing i just didn't like how ups just leaves a note and not call ... so rube thankfuly i when to the store and saw the truck .
Did not like chromebook
Will not work with the printer I have or the CAC card reader I use. It is simply an oversized tablet with less features. Would not recommend buying
it works great.thanks
Love it, the best unit for the money. Makes things easy to do, no windows to drag the unit down, love Chrome OS. Best buy of the year.
Just started using 2017Acer Flagingship so far working as expected .
j am using it now
looks and works great!
Chromebook is good for kids but, if you're a person that does a lot more than just surf the net, it'll drive you crazy. It has nothing that it should (basic network printing options, Adobe, etc.). It's a cool concept, a pretty fast as far as laptops go. But not for the 35 & up crowd
Forced to return item. Item would shut off after 1-5 minutes of use. Very disappointed in product.
Works great for about 4 days and then it stopped working, but enjoyed the speed and the quality for the whole 4 days sorry it didn't work out
Before I wrote down this review, I have used this laptop 3 weeks. Acer's Chromebook 14 has a few things to brag about: Its brushed-aluminum chassis and high-resolution display make it stand out among other affordable models, even if other features remain pretty basic.
I actually bought this for the webcam so I could give it to my elderly mother and we could facetime, etc. After about three months, the webcam is not recognized, so therefor useless.
I had to return it because it was locked by a previous owner and therefore not usable. For the difference in price. I'll purchase a new one.
So far ok,
My old tablet has more capabilities.
No tiene entrada lan
My previous Chrome book was an HP and a little smaller, but so much faster. This one boasted being fast, but it lags quite a bit. I checked my wifi connection and even made sure I had all the updates. This is a nice looking computer, but nice looking does not make it more functional. I am not returning it, but may find some other way to speed it up.
Great chromebook
I didn't like that their was no cd dvd player im disappointed
chrome sucks
bought by mistake.
Went Dark..won't turn on... had it 5 WEEKS
Perfect large screen chromebook fits my needs.
Stars says it all
Great computer, easy to use.
It was a reman computer. I couldn't get into the computer after it was turned on. It was like nothing just the background screen.
Aweful. Dreadful. Slow. Will not be buying another acer product again.
It dont work
I particularly like the system because of her affordability but i dislike it because it lacks some feautures which i really need which i was not aware of it before the purchase of it like inbuilt CD drive, and it doesn't come with temporal antivirus. It really sadenned my heart. I dont mind returning for better system and pay more.
The computer is pretty intuitive but does have some features that I am not used to or should I say don't like, Caps being the main one, I touch type and automatically default to the caps key when capitalizing letters at the being of a sentence, on this model I have to hit the alt and magnifying key at the same time, not sure why they did this but its a pain in the backside so not sure if I will use it that much
This device is worthless can't access half the stuff you should be able to. and can't download an apps
COMPLETELY HORRIBLE. Was a waste of money will never be suckered into anything like this again. Enough said about this JUNK.
didn't realize that it doesn't have windows 10, strictly made for chrome, I'm
As a browser it works great, but I need it for business, and a chrome book does not let me do what I need to. With limited storage, I would have to use a flash drive for all documents, and I can't save pics. We'll probably gift to our daughter and get something else.
These five Acer Flagship CB3-532 HD Chromebooks are working beautifully in my Aquatic Science classroom. They are helping my students do research; post to Schoology; write essays and so much more.
I need back my money. That is a lie
It was my own fault, but I didn't realize it was a Chrome operating system... too excited to find a computer for $200!!I was disappointed that there was no return of a good machine if it had been opened. The problem is, it's a really good computer, just a crummy operating system when you need Windows! READ THE SMALL PRINT BEFORE BUYING SOMETHING.
There was no charger. We need a charger
Chrome browser in a box. If that is what you need excellent. Think of the most locked up useless tablet you can find. That tablet is more useful then a chromebook or a chromebox. Get a keyboard and monitor for your smart phone and you get a better system. If it can run in or on a chrome web browser then it probably run on a chromebook. If can not run on a chrome browser then it can not run on a chromebook.
Itâs refurbished. This is not what I wanted and itâs unclear in the product description. Iâm feeling duped. There doesnât seem to be any customer service to talk to about this. HELP!
I've only had it for about 3 weeks. Here are some things I love: The price can't beat it, it didn't even seem Refurbished. The chrome OS does all I need to do, the FAST on/off awesome compared to my windows desktop. unit is very sturdy I don't know what other posters were saying about cheap feeling, The speakers are very good for a laptop let alone at this price. .Here are the things I don't like but none are deal breaker as I was not expecting a 499.00 laptop comparison: The screen is not the best but better then I thought but again not spending 500$. The keyboard a learning curve but after awhile no prob, a bit slow sometimes works fine in youtube, Netflix , periscope forget it, works but just not enough power under the hood. Over all it was/is a great choice for me.
Literally one of the best laptops I've owned. I've had this for a year now and I wouldn't trade it in for any other laptop. It works so well and gets the job done. Quality of the screen is excellent too
Ended up not needing it, but for the price it is a great back up
Great Quality for low price at first I was skeptical but now I cant put it down!
I bought a new laptop, the laptop I received was obviously used
Not User friendly at all - will never buy a Chromebook ever again. No Ethernet port and crappy wifi reception. Returning same day as recieved. Save yourself the hassle and spend a few bucks more and get a better product.
I bought it his for my 72 year old Mother and within a week the screen went black!!! I trusted this company!! I love 5 hours away and trust me this Mom is not computer savvy. Very disappointing, I will retract my review when this is resolved but until then, do not purchase from this seller. Not fun having a Mother cry because she can play cards online
This is the absolutely worst computer...5 cents is too much to pay for it...the google controlled chrome system is pathetic. DO NOT BUY IT
it sucks do NOT get it it takes for ever to load repeat no way don't get it i hate you if you do Acer should go out of business
Fast service. great chrome book for husband.But it does after 2 weeks.
No cd ROMIm returning for a refund
Piece of Garbage worked for. less than two months and now being ripped off with 30 return time. Do not by Acer crap!!!!!
I bought this Acer one month ago I still can't open until today it is has a password on the lattop I just want to know what is going on :(:(
Exceptional laptop. With that 8th gen Core i5, it's such a pleasure to use this for anything (heck, I was playing a freaking 8K video and a 4K video at the same time and it still wouldn't drop frames), all while battery life is absolutely great. The chassis is sturdy yet very light weight. Really not much to complain about. If you want a lightweight, premium, top performance ultrabook, this is the one to get.My only gripe was that the display seemed to have a bit of green tint, very noticeable when compared to my phone's calibrated display or the Samsung Chromebook Pro I tried for a while, but lowering the Green contrast to 46 from 50 in Intel Graphics settings solved it. I also bumped the saturation just +5, and the screen looks gorgeous nowâvery similar to my small Pixel 2 which is very well calibrated. Only tip is to uninstall ASUS Splendid Video Enhancement Utility as it doesn't allow Intel Graphics Settings to stay after sleep or reboot for some reason, probably because both have calibration options and conflict with each other.With the display fixed, this thing is 10/10. Fan noise is actually very low or non existent in most tasks. Only when I put it under heavy load (like syncing 12,000 files on Google Backup & Sync) do you hear it and even then it's not annoying. And the touchpad does accidentally trigger 'double tap and drag' when you don't want to a few times, but honestly I usually disable 'double tap to drag' because I rarely drag and when I do, it's more natural to click and drag instead of double tapping.This is a great buy that will last you for a long time given the sturdy chassis and future-proof specs.
OK I love it. Have had it for three weeks. Lightening fast. 8th gen i5 and 256 SSD. I love the keyboard . Don't understand the complaint that the feel is too light. No problem with shutdown/restart that some people have reported. Still learning Windows 10, up from Windows 7 on old p.c. Would have liked a third USB port since I use a mouse (old school). Speaking of old school, I don't have a screen bleed problem with gaming or watching videos because, well, I don't do that. No ghosting. No buttons popping off keyboard. I have not yet accidentally turned it off because of the location of the power button where the delete button usually is. I am satisfied with the battery life though it is not 12 hours. But I bet I could get there if I spent some time checking what apps run at startup. recharges fast. It's quiet. It is not hot. So far, I have not had any of the problems recorded by the folks who scored this a 1. So take the chance. It's a really fast, very light, easy to use Zenbook if you simply want a good computer.Model: ASUS ZenBook Ultra-Slim Laptop, 13.3-inch Full HD, 8th gen Intel i5-8250U Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Backlit keyboard, Fingerprint Reader, Anti-Glare, Windows 10, Grey, UX330UA-AH55
Are you on a mid to high end budget? Trying to find a PC that's lightweight and small, without compromising power? Do you care little for 2-1 computers or touch screens? Then this laptop is for you.The specs on this little book are phenomenal. The main selling point for this computer is its 8th Gen Intel i5-8250U processor. The processor is monstrous for this price range. Its base speed of 1.6 GHz, means that your computer will be drawing as little power as possible for low demand tasks like word processing or internet browsing. But its turbo boost up to 3.4 GHz ensures that this laptop has power for more demanding tasks.Oh, and did I mention that this processor has FOUR CORES? Yes, that's right FOUR CORES. This is unusual at this price range, as many laptops on the market around $750 tend to have dual core processors instead. This laptop's processing power rivals, and some cases exceeds others around the $1,000 mark.The PC has enough RAM at 8 GB. Sufficient for most tasks the average consumer will face, and still enough for those looking for an edge. The 256 Solid State Drive provides a reasonable amount of storage. When combined with the processor on this PC, it boots up swiftly.Its battery is more than sufficient for all day use. If you find yourself running low on power, the charger itself is extremely lightweight, and in my experience the laptop is capable of charging around 50% of its battery to near full in about an hour.All of this performance doesn't even take into consideration that this laptop is a lightweight, coming in at 2.6 pounds. As a personal opinion, being able to pick up such a light computer knowing it packs FOUR CORES of power at this price range is an unparalleled high.This laptop is absolutely stellar.
I've only had this a week, but it's been a great week. I've used this laptop for writing reports, email, web browsing, minor photo editing, and wordpress development. It's worked perfectly for all of those tasks, with no slowdown that I've noticed at any time. Battery life is excellent, with around 10 hours of actual use, and very good standby battery life.The only issues I've had are 1) keyboard - the keys are just a bit . . . different. Sometimes I think that I hit a key, but it doesn't register. This mostly happens when I'm typing longer emails or I'm not paying as much attention. If I focus on my typing, it's not an issue. 2) Fan - the CPU fan comes on even during low intensity tasks like web browsing. It's not very loud, but it is noticeable. I wish it were quieter, but it's really not a big deal. For how smooth everything runs, I gladly take the fan noise. And 3) the left USB port doesn't work with my wireless mouse. The right USB port works, and the left USB port works with everything else I've tried, including a USB hub and a thumb drive. Not sure what the issue is there, but I just use the right port.I would definitely buy it again, and I think it's a great device for the price.
This laptop is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I needed something that was light, sturdy, portable, fast, and good on battery life.Build:This laptop is sturdy with hardly any flex to be found. The exterior of the laptop is metal and looks quite nice. The inside is a premium grade plastic. The laptop is extremely solid when closes and I have no worries throwing it into my backpack. It is extremely light and hardly noticeable on my back. The keyboard is surprisingly nice to use (I had expected it to be bad, but boy was I wrong).Screen: The 13 inch ultrabook screen size is perfect. I used to have a 17 inch display but I do not miss it after having the portability of the 13. I do not have any trouble reading the display. The display gets plenty bright for me in nearly every condition. It is sharp and just all around good looking.Battery: This batter lasts far longer than I ever expected it to. Even on the highest performance settings, I can expect it to last about 4 hours. By turning down the brightness of the keyboard and screen, I can get easily over 9 hours of continuous use of of this thing.Speed: Make sure to get the Intel 8th gen chip. Do not settle for the 7th gen or anything less. The 8th is at least a 40% improvement over the 7 and it shows. This thing is lightning fast. It holds many chrome tabs and programs with ease. I have absolutely no problems with the speed of this device (and I am very picky).Price: Anything cheaper than this will have a significant drop in reliability and build quality. You can get other laptops for cheaper, but I wouldn't. After examining many of its competitors (Dell XPS 13, HP Envy, etc.), I can truly say that this is the best value. Other well known ultrabooks do a fantastic job and may improve slightly over this device, but it will come at a much greater cost.Gaming: Extremely light gaming is doable on this laptop but that is definitely not it's intended purpose. If you expect this to be your main computer as a gamer, you should look elsewhere. Ultrabooks just aren't made for that. You will still need to invest in something with a dedicated graphics card and an i7. I use this laptop when I am away from my gaming desktop.
This laptop would be great if the monitor wasn't so terrible. I had backlight bleed watching movies no matter how I set the brightness or contrast. Two of these were defective. I sure hope they don't consider this bleeding acceptable. My 6 year old Asus it replaced has darker black and no spill and it was only about 400 dollars. Too bad. This thing loads fast, is light weight, has plenty of power for work and play, but it's just terrible for doing any work with night charts, movies or anything other than surfing web pages. One computer had problems bleeding from the top left corner, bottom right and center. This one has some bleeding from the bottom left and just right of center. It is distracting and annoying. Completely unacceptable in this day and age. Frustrating as all heck. Thankfully, Amazon customer service processed my rant and is taking good care of me.Honestly, I would not purchase an asus product again after this experience. Quality control is extremely important in technology.
Within a month, the plastic beveling around the screen started to peel off/unattach. I called ASUS support who are the absolute worst. Albeit, all computer customer services are terrible except for Apple. ASUS wanted me to ship back my laptop, at my expense, and wait 4 weeks to get it back. No thanks. Fortunately amazon is letting me return this. Way too dangerous to keep this laptop for the long term and see what other issues arise. Wirecutter needs to update their reviews and remove this cheaply made laptop. Go for Dell XPS 13 insteadBUYER BEWARE
Everything you would want in a laptop-lightweight-GREAT screen in my opinion (laptops have trouble having good screens)-long lasting battery charge-charges fast-SUPERB KEYBOARD....-Trackpad is just fine for me, others complain but I haven't had a problem. If anything it's great.-wide viewing angle FHD-Thin-Finger print reader-Good SSD (Nothing crazy but just good enough)-I can run SFV / RCT3 (Street Fighter V, 720p/low settings / Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, 1080p nearly maxed settings) both at 60fps+ with the right settings. (Gaming)-great resolution screen, super clear once you set everything up-No real junkware on here, everything like ASUS Hello (gives free dropbox 12 month for 30gbs), sets up your warranty / acc. to ASUS Splendid (screen), that Vivid option is great.-Super good for price (Performance to price ratio)-Has auto brightness, but I turned my option off but it has a sensor for darkness / brightness of the screen-Dual mic for better qualitySometimes I even turn *down* the screen because it's too bright at times. Currently my screen writing this review is on 33%.neutral:-power button is near backspace. I have no problem with it.. I'm too muscle memory to press random buttons but I can see how beginners / non-tech savy / or butterfingers can press it by accidentcon:-Bad webcam. If you need a webcam, buy an external and still get the laptop!! Gladly, I don't use a webcam.Hit me up under this thread if you want to know something specific.
Very nice ultrabook.Pluses:The startup is fast in about 5-6 secs. The fingerprint scanner is responsive also.SSD performs quite well.Screen is very sharp (not incredibly bright). Not sure what it'd be like in sunlight.Touch pad is very accurate and responsive.Minuses:-No dedicated Insert key (might not be a big deal to most people but for someone who uses Shift-Ins for paste. It's a difficult adjustment to have to hit the Shift-Fn-delete to insert.-The keyboard isn't the best but not bad either. Keys not hit perfectly sometimes lead to missed letters. It's fine for a laptop keyboard though.-Not expandable for memory and SSD
PROS:1. This is my third Asus - all are still working, just old. I've been pleased with reliability, performance, and battery life on all - and especially this one.2. Very light.3. Fast.4. Good screen size for small laptop.CONS:1. Power button is upper right - where you expact to hit the delete key. (Delete key is to left of it) I had to put a cardboard flap over the power button since every time I went to delete I turned off the PC.2. I like having discrete Home, Page Up/Down, End keys - but it is okay to use CTRL and the arrow keys for that - just took a minute to get used to.OTHER:1. Was a little hard to get used to the keyboard, the keys felt a little far apart - like I needed bigger hands. But after a couple of days, no problems.2. Not a big fan of Windows 10, extra clicks to get most basic tasks done. OneNote does not work properly with it. But that is not Asus' fault.3. I thought the screen was too dim and was a complaint - but then realized that I needed to change the power settings. Now the screen is nice and bright.4. Fan is only loud-ish when doing virus scans or something intensive, otherwise very quiet.
So far so good.I had a Lenovo Idea laptop for 6 years .It was fanatastic ,never broke down ,but is running slow now.And is so heavy.The Asus is so light 2.6lbs versus 4.7lbs.It boots in seconds,is fast,great picture on screen.If it holds up im going to really like it.Some reviews scared me .Noisy fan ,can't hear the fan at all.So do I have any complaints ? Well yes ,not serious ones .Too few USB's only 2 ,I always had 3 and miss the extra one.The keys are ok ,only ok ,not excited about them.Also I thought the keyboard was backlit,well ttheyr'e not..Despite those negatives ,I think I will really love this computer .I think you will too.I'm glad I waited for the 8th generation ,it's great.1/14/2018 :After using this for a couple of weeks ,I have simmered down a bit.First I wish the screen was a little sharper and being a small screen it gets a little hard to read the lettering.I also notice that the sound while ok ,is not too great.I'm comparing this Zen to a Lenovo ideapad which is 6 or 7 years old,much sharper, better sound ,but almost twice as heavy.I notice it is (kinda) backlit ,again not as well backlit as the Lenovo .I will say the Lenovo cost $200 more than the Zen.What I appreciate most is the 7 second boot time and the long battery life.2/2/2018An update.I got a scare a week ago.I got a black screen ,it wouldn't boot.I kept trying turning of and on for an hour.Eventually it started to work again.I did a restore point.The only problem with buying a computer online is ,it's not easy to return.Prices are better on Amazon but unlike Best Buy you can't drive and return it.Food for thought.
This is really my backup/travel computer. I have a high-end model that I do not like to take on the road. I purchased this model to fill in that gap. It has virtually everything I need. Backlit. Light. Good graphics. I don't game with it, so I can't speak to gaming. I only gave it 4 stars for a couple of reasons. 1) The on-off key is located on the upper right of the keyboard, right next to the DELETE key. I can't say how many times I've gone to delete something and accidentally turned off the machine. 2) The ARROW keys are in a funky arrangement, and they are inappropriately sized.All in all though, I like the machine. Since I keep everything on a cloud anyway, I'm not too concerned if this dies. But it's been very reliable. It starts incredibly fast. Some features are much better than my Yoga. No touch-screen though. But that would have added some serious $$ to the price.
A couple days ago first one came in an unopened clean box. Laptop was clean and untouched. It was flawless! I was so happy after TEN years with my good old 5.8 lb VAIO, which I'm writing this review on. Everything was great and laptop was so smooth, fast, lightweight, it has awesome track pad sensitivity and feeling (contrary to reviews I've seen) and a beautiful design, BUT... There was an incredible buzzing noise whenever I scroll down/up. I'm not sure if it was coming from the fan or something, but it sounded like it'd be a serious problem in a foreseeable future. I've returned it. The second one came today. Product box was already opened (black tape with ASUS logo on it was cut) and it was really disappointing. Still, I kept going to see if it were acceptable or not. There were fingerprints everywhere, a scratch on the screen and another one on the case. Annoying white dust stuck between the bottom side of the screen and the bezel (I don't know how did they manage to do that because there is almost no even any space between the screen and the bezel!). And lastly, Windows 10 installing guide was different than the first one. It was weird/clipped and made me uncomfortable. Frustrated, I've returned that too and got a refund. I'll probably wait a little before I order another one or look for a different laptop. I'm so sorry about all this because it's a beautifully designed and really fast laptop -according to my 2 day experience with the first one-...
This laptop replaced an older 11" Asus VivoBook, which had served us well for years but was getting doggy. This laptop Is a great travel/around-the-house/light office work model. Form factor is fantastic, THIN, like WAFER THIN, and very light. Great case design and quality construction. Snappy as all get out: more than sufficient processing power from the i5 8250U chip, sufficient memory to support everyday activity, and SSD for quick boot and file access. No qualms about performance whatsoever. Keyboard and trackpad are good quality with snappy reaction. Screen is pretty good, although there is a little light bleed evident at the bottom and top bezels on boot-up. Not noticeable during operation, though. Integrated graphics are fine for typical Windows operations and video rendering, but not recommend this laptop for any sort of demanding applications or gaming.
I have had multiple issues with this laptop.1. The laptop refuses to balance on all 4 of its rubber feet which makes it extremely hard to balance it on any flat surface without experiencing significant screen wobble.2. The OS crashed and refused to do a complete system restore.3. Experienced terrible wi-fi issues (Public Network only) which turned out to be a driver issue that corrupted after Windows launched the Fall Creators Update4. Terrible fan rattling noise which definitely felt like there was something pushing against it.Overall I personally have had a very bad experience with the laptop and returned both the original and the replacement orders
The Asus Zenbook Ultra-Slim Laptop is everything I wanted.I purchased the 8th gen i5 core and is by far the best laptop I owned for such price.It's very slim, works super fast, and that touch-screen login is just AMAZING.The fan sometimes briefly makes a loud sound you're running too many apps, but that never bothered me.The battery time is by far impeccable. This thing lasts me 8-12 hours depending on the apps I'm using and the brightness setting.The screen is a bit flimsy and not as sturdy as most laptops (as in it kinda shakes when you move it around, but not to the point where it's a flaw in my opinion.)I'm just completely in love with its design and everything about it is delightful to me.
I have had this laptop for a little over a month now and am really happy with it. It is a good middle of the road laptop. It is light and slim which makes it great for traveling and working online.Pros:- Very light and portable but doesn't feel chintzy. It seems to be constructed well.-The i5 does pretty well. The onboard graphics will bottleneck in certain situations, though, I have only encountered this when gaming.-As just mentioned this will handle light gaming. I play Skyrim with medium settings and have good framerate any more than that and it will bog down. I was able to play overwatch as well but had to do a lot of fiddling with the graphics to get it to run smooth.-This is my first computer with an SSD and I love them. From the time you push power, you can be opening your web browser in 15 seconds. It also helps with the dreaded windows update. It takes SIGNIFICANTLY less time to update.-The harman/kardon speakers are great they have a good sound quality for a laptop speaker and are plenty loud.-The battery life is very good. It will stay charged for 5 or 6 hours while gaming while connected to the internet and full brightness. Essentially, you will have 5 to 6 hours of battery at the least. You can get at least 12 hours with light use.-A common complaint about this laptop is a loud fan. I haven't experienced this at all. Mine is very quiet and works well.- I use it for photo editing via lightroom and it does well.Cons:-The screen doesn't have a wide range of motion. It probably only goes to 100 degrees or so.-As I said you can do light gaming with this but if you a really into gaming and want to play with high settings this isn't for you.Overall this laptop is great for work a little above your typical internet streaming and word processing. This is probably the best value you will find before moving into the Ultrabook tier.
I really like this computer. The only thing that is a bit off for me is the keyboard is not great. sometimes I hit the key and it does not register. This is particularly frustrating when coding. It could be my typing but I don't have issues with other keyboards. Also, the touch pad is a little different to use. It's touch is a little off. All in all this is a really good buy.
I don't know why this has so many good reviews regarding the screen. I absolutely could not stand the matte screen with the rainbow shimmering effect, especially on white backgrounds. It gave me headaches just after a few minutes, so I knew I couldn't keep it. The backlight bleed was horrible on dark apps like Visual Studio Code, or photo editing tools that use a dark background. Uneven backlight just kills the usefulness for many workflows, too.Performance-wise, it was as you'd expect out of the 8th generation Core i5's. I was content with that aspect, and the hardware build was sufficiently nice for its price-point.I just wish that there were more reviews cautioning me about the display quality, or I would have never gone with this model. I went with an Dell Inspiron 7373 with similar specs for a hundred dollars less on sale, and I've been plenty happy with the screen on that model instead.
I am so inlove with this laptop. When I got it I felt like a kid with christmas gift. It is very light, what I am still admiring, and the size perfectly fits my smaller backpack, so I can carry it with myself whenever I need. It is really very fast, its almost have no sound ( if I want to hear, I have to stop what I am doing and try to listen) and I love the keyboard, which makes very smooth writting feeling. I really like that the screen has eye-saving mode, so it will not get tired. And the battery last for about 6-7 hours without charging. I am still enjoying to work with it.
I don't know where you can get so much power in so sleek-cool package for the price. Hits the ground running with software set-up. Start to deployable for use in about and hour. Windows 10 and Office 365 comes preloaded saving hours of download (yea!)... just add accounts and passwords. Seamless link to existing wireless hardware and drivers.I've purchased 3 ZenBooks. This edition is better integrated with Windows for ease of set-up. I appreciate ASUS's cutting the bloat-ware load.Great value for money. No cons.
This is the worst laptop Iâve ever had in my life. My wireless connection was too slow, so I updated the wireless driver and got this resolved. But the battery driver stopped working and now itâs not detected by the OS. The laptop doesnât turn on without the AC adapter. Already tried to reinstall Windows but didnât worked as well. And I canât send it back to amazon because I live in another country. Also, ASUS global warranty assistance does not work in my country Brazil. I bought this laptop a month ago. Iâve been saving money for a laptop for 2 years and now my brand new laptop is broken and useless. I tried everything, since reinstalling official drivers, restoring from a previous point and reinstalling Windows. I canât even describe my frustration.
I'm a computer science student so having a PORTABLE laptop is essential. I really made an investment in this because it's a lot more expensive than my original price point but this laptop has everything I needed.The laptop is slim and super light so it's extremely portable.The battery lasts for FOREVER. I took this to a hackathon and at one point I was away from my charger and it lasted in power save mode for at least 3-4 hours after it got below 25%. It would have lasted longer but I plugged it in as soon as I could.The screen is awesome. I noticed a lot of the reviews before I bought this complained about the screen being too dim but for me its perfect. It's not extremely bright which really saves your eyes if you're up until midnight writing some code :^)Also, the i5 8th gen processor makes this laptop worth every penny.
Packaging was fine and the box was neat with no dents. When I saw the item I was so excited. Unfortunately when I turned on the laptop, it was glitching out from the start. The audio was fine too. I was so disappointed. The look and feel of the laptop is great. Will be returning and ordering a replacement.
I really liked this laptop HOWEVER I want every prospective buyer to know that USB-C port of this laptop does not support any video output thus it does not recognize any usb-c to HDMI converters. I have tried an apple converter and another (UGReen) converter , it does not recognize the HDMI video output.... ASUS should have mentioned this clear.USB-C to ethernet is recognized through the port..Now i have to buy separate cables.. I wish ASUS would have put a full HDMI port.
I really wanted to like this computer. And I did, except that the battery didn't work. It's fast and has a nice keyboard and display. It's very light weight and attractive. Mine apparently had a defective battery that wouldn't charge, and the OS reported 'No battery installed.' I returned it. Amazon was very good about the return.
The performance of this laptop is great, but the level of pressure for the "e" key is much greater than the forc required to press other keys, which makes it annoying when I'm typing because I'll often press the "e" key too lightly for it to register when that amount of force would be fine on any other key (this is a mechanical issue). This fairly little problem causes me to have to retype a lot of words, and it is the only problem I have with it, although I bet it's just a problem with my specific laptop. If this didn't occur I'd give it 5 stars. I might return it to get the same model.
So good I just bought another one. Fast, light, bright sharp screen, SSD makes boot up just a few seconds. Thin and great battery life averaging 8-10 hours of use between charges. That's about once every 3-4 days of casual use for me. The only improvement I can think of is to make the keys a little more curved instead of flat. But other than that, it's a perfect laptop. Does not come with a huge amount of bloatware that needs to be removed. The speakers are not too bad either.The Dell XPS 13 may be better but at $1300 compared to this one at $750, this one is a much better value.
Got this laptop for computer science courseWas skeptical about this laptop but im so glad i got it!Zero problems like coil whine etc, for some reason i love the look including the bezel, and actually think it looks much better than the ux430 (my friend has it), performance is great with the 8th gen cpu. I was concernced with the slow ssd but its perfectly adequate!Overall great laptop at a great price
This is a great laptop and I would give it 5 stars except for one thing. I do wish ASUS had not installed Mcafee. It is part of the system and automatically reminds you to renew once your 'trial' subscription has ended. You can decline but you will continue to get reminders to renew several times a day and this is very annoying. I have tried to find ways to stop this even removing Mcafee from the system and going to there site to see what I can do about it so far no luck
This laptop is fantastic. Light, with an aluminum shell. The keyboard has a little give, but that is pretty similar to my previous laptop and chromebook. The laptop moves quickly, the screen is bright and crisp, stays connected to the internet. Gaming is pretty limited as this isn't a gaming laptop but the intel hd 620 chipset handles 3d images with no problem and modern games can be played with a bit of tweaking.
As a Mac lover, I need a Windows machine to take care some tasks. The ASUS ZenBook does the trick. I am sorry the RAM cannot be increased. The boot-up time is an impressive 25 seconds and handles apps like Dropbox well. I am particularly impressed with the responsive track pad compared to my older Windows machine made in 2014. All in all, great pick for the price.
I received my asus zenbook ux330ua today and was so excited to begin working on it. However, I immediately noticed how dark the screen is and even when I adjust the screen brightness to the highest setting, it is still very dark. I was very disappointed about this. I have attached a picture to show a comparison between the screen brightness of a hp laptop and the asus I just received.
Very satisfied. On line very helpful on setting up. Took over my computer and helped set it up. Perfect for my use. Of course there will always be something better value coming on the market, but was good value at the time I bought it without having to pay a fortune. Like everything except that the mouse seems very sensitive and I prefer an external mouse. Also I am not sure that the battery lasts as long as is advertised, but long enogh for my purpose.
Stable, fast, well designed. Average sound but very good monitor. This is a better alternative to Dell which I use for work, itâs really a great buy at this price too, I like it so much I ended up buying two.
This thing is tiny. It weighs so little I went to lift it up thinking it would be as heavy as my old one and it nearly flew out of my hands because it's so light. It's powerful, and connects to my external drives easily.
Excellent value, super thin and light almost everything work very well including the touchpad (saw reviews that it was stiff but my family is fine with it). The only thing that could be a bit better is the quality of the IPS screen. I would have paid +$50 for a better monitor. But totally do not regret the purchase and would probably buy it again.
the bluetooth has is stopped two times working after 5 or 6 hours of use, it appears "Unknown device (code 43)" on the device manager. Looks like the module is afected by the heat, because it works again when I turn off the laptop and wait around for an hour. That's too bad, means a direct hardware problem.
I just received the laptop. Unfortunately, it was defective. There are gaps at the bottom of all round the chassis, and some wires are exposed. The bottom panel of the chassis doesn't seem to be the correct part for the model and small. I just requested a replacement. I hope I can update my review with a better score when I get the replacement,=== Update ===I got a replacement. The new one looks okay. At least, there are no big gaps or exposed wires.
I received my new laptop a few weeks ago and must say I love my ZenBook! Super light, super thin, and super fast! I was worried I would have a lot of bloatware (as my Dell came with) but besides a couple of games I could easily delete, it was just right! The fingerprint scanner is nice, but not as good as an iPhone. It doesnât always read accurately-not a big enough problem to doc a rating from. Overall very pleased.
At first it was all okay but after some usage, the metal screen frame started to levitate from bottom and made hard to open the computer. I have sent to ASUS for repair, received now but nothing seems changed. I think the product is defective or it is second-quality. I don't recommend this product. Additionally, it is so hard to get your problem solved by the actual people who can help in terms of replacement or refund.
I bought this for my son in January. The charge lasts the entire day at school, and I know that it is not all used for educational purposes.The display is very matt and gives the impression of not being sharp, but in fact it is quite ok and it proves very useful in bright environments, and you get no reflection.The keyboard is quite good and feels nice.It doesn't produce noise (except when under a lot of pressure mainly during updates and heavy graphics usage).The ports are great and useful.The storage and memory are also at the sweep spot, and well balanced.So overall extremely happy, given that the price difference here in australia for a similar spec would be around the $500.
I needed a laptop that could withstand travel. I like the solid state hard drive, the slim profile and the matte screen. I have a second laptop that is my photography processing workhorse that never leaves my office so I did not need a lot of hard drive space or RAM. I use this laptop for internet research/shopping and writing. I am very happy with my purchase.
I received it 2 weeks ago and so far so good.Just a few notes for the potential buyers and the one who are still not sure whether to purchase it or not.1- Out of the box every thing was fine, but the WiFi download speed. It was terrible and I were sure something is wrong. I normally have around 50 Mbps download and around 100 Mbps upload speed. However, with this laptop it was around 1 Mbps download and almost 100 Mbps upload speed. I searched the web, but there were some wrong info. I reinstalled windows, updated WiFi driver through device manager but it was not the solution. The only solution was to update the Windows to the latest version (Windows 10 Fall Creators Update) and afterward upgrading the WiFi driver via the Intel's website (I mean downloading the driver from intel's website not the device manager). Now every thing is fine and the download and upload speed are as they should be.2- Besides the above mentioned issue, the most important issue, is the fan noise. I mean it starts working when you don't believe it is necessary and makes of course noise. I haven't checked the CPU temperature, but I found the cooling fan active when I was downloading a bis software package and installing some others which I believe is not that much. However, it seems it's due to the thickness of the laptop and it gets warm very quick.3- Last but not least, although the production quality is fine enough, the casing material (The Aluminium alloy I think) is not that great. You can easily feel the difference with a high-end laptop body like Apple MacBooks. However, that's not bad at all, it's just not premium.For the best parts, I would choose first the weight. You can't imagine how thin and light is that. Furthermore, the battery last for almost the whole day and you can be sure that you won't get out of charge through the day. Although ASUS claims 12 hours, for the mixes tasks like internet browsing, movie watching, some office works and general university stuff, you can be sure to have at least 8 hours of charge.All in all, I rate this great machine 5 star, since price-wise it's even more than the best. You get the latest Intel Core i5 together with 8GB RAM and 256 SSD in s very thin and light body just for 750$. That's great and I am satisfied till now.
So far, so good. Great form factor and fast. Not too much bloatware, just uninstall McAfee crap. The screen looks good and the flat (non glossy) finish works well for clarity and wide angle of viewing. I travel often and replaced a 6 year old Acer ultrabook at about the same pricepoint. Since Acer isn't a high end brand, I hope to get similar long life out of this one. I'll update if it doesn't perform as expected.
Product was as described. I bought from Amazon. This is the 8gb 256gbssd 13in fhd asus ux330ua-ah55 8th gen intel core i5 processor.Laptop is thin, light, and fast enough for daily use. Build is very sturdy, very nice aluminum body. Ordered last Nov23, 2017 and recieved on Nov 28.I love the FHD antiglare display and matte screen. The fingerprint sensor works very well for me. It has enough ports for me, the SD card sticks out when plugged in as seen in the picture.The fans turn on with moderate tasks such as video editing and photoshop, but it is not that loud to me.Keyboard is backlit and takes a little getting used to due to shorter key travel compared from my older laptop.The trackpad is just ok, it is not the best. I dont use the web camera so I cant say anything for it.Sounds on this laptop has good quality, I can hear a little bass and it is loud enough to fill the living room and can be heard outside the house.Battery life so far lasts about 8 to 10hours. Laptop is for mobility.This laptop is great for me and I would recommend it. Worth it for its price.ASUS ZenBook Ultra-Slim Laptop, 13.3-inch Full HD, 8th gen Intel i5-8250U Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Backlit keyboard, Fingerprint Reader, Anti-Glare, Windows 10, Grey, UX330UA-AH55
Excellent value for money, thin, slim and beautifully designed, as for the specs latest gen core i5 processor and 8 gb of RAM are more than enough for everyday taks and even light gaming and video editing. The keyboard feels really good but not as good as a Macbook if you are upgrading from one of those as is my case, the screen is decent but probably the least quality item from the pack. Mine came with 3 dead pixels but it was impossible to return it since I brought it to my home country in South America and I found out it doesn't have international warranty, so this is something you need to carefully consider if you live outside the US.
Wow! Great laptop. Amazing speed, lit keyboard and 10 hour battery. Slim and lightweight. Fingerprint access, which works MOST of the time. Rest of he time, use a PIN or your password. Very pleased with this laptop.
Not a tech kinda person. I just wanted a laptop for uni that would be able to use word and PowerPoint and let me watch my lecture videos. Well, itâs fantastic. Nice and lightweight, thin, sleek and works really well. The best part is that the battery lasts for ages! I use my laptop every day for uni (~6 hours a day maybe more or less depending on the day) and Iâll charge it probably 4 times a week! Love this laptop, definitely recommend!
Best bang for the buck at the technology level required for comfortable use. If someone says "I need a good laptop, nothing fancy, but I don't want any significant compromises" - this is the one to get.
Simple and quick setup. No software or function issues. With that said there was a small damage on the back of the laptop display. The smooth metal finish is aesthetically pleasing but the multiple imperfection show up quite easily. This does affect the overall perception of the product, which seem to have flaws in the manufacturing process. There were no issues with the packaging however.
Love the size of this computer, but it takes an act of God to get the keyboard to work with any degree of ease.
Exactly what I needed, slick and hearty. There are other reviews that complain of fan noise: I can tell when the fan is on, but it's not super noticeable. I'm not sure if my unit is just soft spoken or if the people complaining of fan noise are super sensitive. Track pad works great, fingerprint reader is a nice feature. All in all, a really good unit.
Something is very wrong with the wireless adapter. I contacted customer service at Asus multiple times and have not received the help I need.
The sensitive area of the touchpad overlaps the left and right mouse buttons. The designers must have eaten too many Tide Pods. Seriously ... why would anyone cover buttons on a keyboard with the touchpad?
Amazing ultrabook. I purchased mine refurbished and besides some faint scratching on the hinge, everything is perfect. Stellar battery life and performance. Fingerprint sensor is nice. Back-lit keyboard and screen are all very bright. Only wish they would include a micro HDMI to HDMI adapter in the box.
All good. Great laptop. perfect size and decent battery life. Exactly what I needed. My only problem is that the fan sometimes makes some noise and gets heated up pretty fast, and it's just my second day! It would make some noise for a few mins and then go back to normal. I'm just pretty concerned that it's only my second day of using it..
This is now my main machine, I got this on a warehouse deal and could not be happier. The keyboard backlight, battery life, power, everything has been spectacular.
This replaces the mac air in weight. I enjoy it very much. As I seem to be more of a Windows user, then a Max user.
Very disappointed with this device. I loved it at first but appears the hinge that connects the top to the keyboard is very cheap and easily torn. It also freezes completely on occasion and not sure what causes this problem. I am sending it in to be repaired and may request a refund.
This is a slick little laptop, especially for the money. The processor flies and the slim size and light weight make it SUCH an improvement over my old balky Dell. The comments in the trade press and here about the track pad are true - its definitely the weak link in the hardware. But I'm getting used to it gradually. For not much money they could make this SO much better with a better pad.
the mouse is almost completely unresponsive and makes scrolling or browsing (the main purpose of this laptop) nearly impossible. I am not picky but this is unusable! Do not buy this laptop! I am out of the 30 day return policy otherwise I would return this asap!
Super slim and light perfect for backpack to school. Nice screen. Windows version of MacBook Air
This is an awesome laptop for working and light gaming! A few things that may annoy people: fans do get a bit loud even if if you are not doing heavy stuff like watching Netflix or Twitch, screen is not at best at the light of a sunny day but it's not bad! Overall easily best laptop for the money that you can get in this price range.
thin and slicenice laptop for student who take it out everydaystrong performance with core 8 th gen cpukeyboard with automatic backlitbut...LDDR3 memory come on it is 2018 Asus.. why not get ddr4?the edge of screen is too thick for a 2017 portable laptop otherwise it could make to 14inch display with its size
Was an OK computer, but ordered the more expensive model, which was worth the extra $100
I never could get it to turn on, even after 6 hours of charging. Sent it back, and haven't had the nerve to replace it yet.
This is the best laptop I have ever owned, albeit I've only owned one before this, it was made to run windows. The internal hard drive makes everything better, and it looks chic to display.
Great laptop. Great lightweight computer for commuting. Works as advertised. Excellent battery life ( I can get 10 hours with battery saver on sometimes). My only complaint is that the trackpad is kind of crappy. You get used to it after awhile, but it can be a little wonky. Everything else works great.
The laptop is gorgeous. A bit smaller than expected. This is a dim computer, so if you are looking for a bright display, this is not it. Also, the video pixelates and are blurry. I am returning it for these reasons.
I've been using this computer for 5 months now and I absolutely love it! It's fast and easy to use. So light and comfortable to carry around. Exactly what I wanted!
I would say that I will recommend this computer especially for college students! Itâs an overall 5 stars! From shipping, packaging to quality and performance.
Great computer for the price
My husband and I are not very tech savy people, but we really like our ZenBook. It is very lightweight and very fast.
I got this laptop for the purpose of college/graduate school, and am so far highly satisfied with the laptop. It is incredibly light and thin, and runs very quickly! It is a very compact size, has a very sharp display, and is very affordable. Would definitely recommend this laptop to any college student!
Still setting things up. . . . .this thing is lightening fast. Keep hitting the power button instead of delete though!
This laptop may not have all the bells and whistles that other more expensive computers do, but it gets the job done at a more reasonable price. It is very quiet while operating and is super lightweight and portable. Meets all the basic needs of a student.
Excelent laptop for the price, buy with the i5 core 8th generation.
really fast. light.Awkward placement of "delete" button.
The first thing I noticed after turning it on for the first time were bright spots around the perimeter of the screen but mostly at the bottom. Not a big deal when on the web but when watching watching a movie and the background became dark, it was annoying. See the photo.I heard good things about Asus customer support which is one of the main reasons I got the computer. I let them know about the problem and they responded once asking if I dropped it to which I told them no and then never heard back even after a couple more attempts. At that point I initiated a return with Amazon who of course was great.The aluminum body is nice but I was not impressed with the build quality because it has a lot of flex to it. Overall it felt cheap.Anyway, glad a lot of people like the computer and I hate leaving anything less than a 5 star review but 3 stars in my case was more than generous.
Horrible. My computer gives me a blue screen that doesnât go away unless I shut down the whole computer losing any work I didnât save.Did attempt to remove and redownload Microsoft Offiice. But did not fix the issue.
The screen is a yellow tint and if you are not used to it as I was, it is annoying and the clarity seems bad. After a time, you do get used to it so that's great.
Arrived safe and sound.
Great laptop, light and easy to use. Still compatible with all the software I used for Window 7.
Very fast and light, great for internet browsing, casual gaming, music, ect. Not for intensive games.
This computer is super fast and works great. Nice battery life, and way better value than those overpriced MacBooks.
Great computer so far! Lightweight, streamline, works quickly, great screen. Very happy so far. I do wish the keys were slightly more raised, but I will get used to the new keyboard I am sure.
It has everything that I look for in a laptop. Excellent performance and battery life, fantastic set of connectivity options, high-quality keyboard and trackpad, lightweight body,
The best purchase in terms of computers. Sometimes it is a little noisy but the battery life and the light weight combined with it's practicality make it a wonderful choice.
Great laptop. Very useful.
In the middle of trying to resolve an issue with the laptop frequently losing WiFi internet connection whereas our other devices stay connected. Hopeful that we donât have a lemon. Love the slim lightweight design.
Came with a wobbly base. Fan was also making a sharp sound at times - not sure if that's a big deal but the uneven base killed it for me.
Excellent value even with import tax, very fast, light and great quality. You will need a 2 to 3 pin adaptor for the UK and of course itâs got a US keyboard layout but thatâs not really a problem.
I got this computer for college, and it is perfect for me. The only problem is the touchpad is very touchy. Other than that I am very happy I made this purchase.
The delivery was very quick without any damage to the laptop. This laptop is the best bang for the buck. Smooth interface and no lags. cheers to Amazon.
Love it. Hard to get used to the smaller size, but it is perfect for school since I have to carry it around with me.
Runs smoothly and works good for starting photography.
I love this laptop, perfect laptop for my college use. I love the matte screen, it's not glossy so there is no glare. It's super thin and portable.
If you're looking for a light laptop, for school that can do basic workload and a little more. This is the one for you. Glad I purchased this!
Awesome service delivery timed perfectly, brilliant product - have spent much time enjoying the features of this lightweight machine.
Just got this computer 3 days ago.. it's blazing fast, feels solid and looks good.. the aluminum body gives it a premium feel and I love it..so far everything is working as it should.. battery seems to last a lot, but probably because i'm comparing to my 6 years old laptop that had only like an hour o so.. anyway, I'm very happy with my purchase and recommends to anyone looking for a new ultrabook..
Never regret buying it
Got exactly what I expected and performs flawlessly. The SSD makes a huge difference.The i5 compares to last gen's i7 at a fraction of the cost.
Loved the zenbook for its lightness and easy to carry. Good battery life. It will be better if ssd drive can can be higher capacity.
Overall is good, although the touch pad is a bit annoying when using it.
A laptop with good performance, very light! I liked it!
Im very stoked with my new computer. Light, fast, good battery and very nice look. Working good so far. Recommend.
Loving this laptop so far. The battery and screen are great. The sound is okay, as expected for a laptop of this size. The keyboard is a little weird however. I'm a pretty fast typer, and the short travel on the keys makes it a little difficult to type with. I swear I've never misspelled as much as I have with this keyboard. The wireless is super fast. The SSD makes for super quick loading, including bootups and shutdowns. The fingerprint reader is a MUST. I will never go back to a laptop without a fingerprint reader after having this computer. Overall, a great buy.
Outstanding device for the money....
Starts up quick, runs what I need for school effortlessly, and weighs next to nothing.
Best bang for the buck.
Loved it
Excellent machine!
No annoying fan noise, just normal fan spin when the computer is under load.
I got broken one when lid was not in good shape.
Outstanding laptop. Excellent deal for the price. Light and fast
Amazing product. Great for all my home pc meeds and more.
great laptop, well worth it. no fan problems, great speakers, and beautiful screen.
Bought brand new. Display came with a stuck pixel (google it). Annoying for factory default/brand new. Battery is advertised as 12 hours all over. Realistically, itâs more like 5-8 with moderate usage.UPDATE - My battery was at 32% at the beginning of my evening class (6:30PM), and by 6:50 PM the laptop was at 3%, then died immediately after. The percentage shown is not accurate at all, and the battery life seems to be getting worse over time.
It's an amazing notebook. Very fast with an incredible design. Worth every cent.
Loud coil whine and Hugh fan speed seemingly at random but otherwise great laptop
You pay less and you get more... great buy...
I think this item has a great per dollar value
Amazing laptop at a great price!
Beautiful. Fast, lightweight. Does what it should do.
Very good laptop, I am fully satisfied.
Firstly, this laptop gets MAYBE 4 hours of battery life, which is 1/3 the advertised 12h. The ONLY programs I use are browsers, FTP, and Textpad, and I keep the battery settings dialed way down. Secondly, I've owned it for less than 4 months and the adapter just stopped working. And I take care of my equipment; it's not like I throw it around. I wish I'd stuck with Acer. Thirdly, when I attempted to contact Asus about getting a speedy replacement? Nothing. Crickets. No response via email, my Asus account, or twitter. Nice.Other than the poor service, poor battery life, and poor adapter quality, everything else was pretty nice.
Love the 8th gen, the slick design
It's nimble!
good service and nice product...
I am a previous owner of a ASUS UX31A that I bought in mid 2013. It finally wore out, I liked it so bought this one as a replacement. Though it is fine there are a few unadvertised changes that irk me. First, this one does not open nearly as much as the UX31A. The UX31A would open almost 150 degrees, this one only to about 130 degrees. I have already run into operating situations where this I miss the old spec. For instance if the laptop is on a kitchen counter and you are standing to use it -- you really want that extra opening angle. Second, the UX31A power supply was made so the two prongs would fold back into the body of the power cube. This was great when you threw it into your carry case so the prongs would not poke into anything. Not so with this new one. They stick out and that's it. The UX31A came with a slip case. Not this one. Finally the speakers on the UX31A were on a bar in front of the function keys. On this one they come out the bottom of the case. Sound can be muffled. In my mind 3 poor design decisions and one just cheap cost saving measure. Now I am disappointed. If I had known these things I would have looked around some more before purchasing it.
2 stars is "I don't like it", which is true. Its cheaply made. My first one had a issue with the sound, couldn't hear from internal speaker or through headphones. With this one, the frame for the screen has peeled off from the screen so now I gotta glue it together. Another issue is it sounds like there is a wire that is loose and is being hit by the fan. Also, it often runs very hot with just a browser open or Netflix running. I have to operate a Linux partition to avoid that last issue but there are somethings I must use Windows for. This is sad because my last Asus laptop was less expensive but ran much better than this. Best thing about this thing is the long battery life and nice display, but overall it's not worth it.
Its fan is loud after a few months. One annoying thing is the "McAfee LiveSafe" subscription. I guess ASUS has a linked thing with the computer protection thing called " McAfee Livesafe." it expires after a few months and it pops up annoyingly. It forces you to pay for it. I mean I guess. I was hoping there was a windows firewall already or something? But really? lol.... Overall the laptop is fine. It reminds me of the Apple laptops. no bad. The fingerprint reader is nice too. Wish the speakers were on top but they are realy awesome. Idk i like it and i love it.
Battery DOA, the laptop wouldn't turn on, and when plugged in to a power adapter, didn't recognize the existence of a battery, the windows battery indicator said 0% available, plugged, in not charging!! Brand new, out of box laptop. Ordered a replacement, will see how that fares. Be warned.
Bought this for my wife. She loves it. Now she's got the best computer in the house. Fabulous picture and very fast. Only drawback is that Windows needs to work a little on their tablet mode interface.
I just got this computer so I won't say much here right now. But one thing I don't like is the promise of a 12 hour battery life. Mine can go from fully charged to dead in 6 hours. And it has taken 3 hours to fully charge up again. Not good.
Exactly what I was looking for! Plus, part of the proceeds go towards a great cause! If you pair that with amazon smile, then youâre donating to two causes with one purchase.
I receive yesterday, and despite the wonderful computer, speed and very light. the battery was not recognise by the computer. it means that I am returning back the computer. Hope the new one that I will get tomorrow can come correctly.
Ok, so I did major, major research on this puppy. Really, there isn't much else in the category that comes close to this price.Unfortunately, the Touchpad drivers (which I discovered have been a WELL KNOWN ISSUE for several years) were complete junk, and all it took was one Windows update to basically make the thing useless. In total, I spent probably about 8 hours trying to find a solution, but every time I restarted after brief periods of success, the Touchpad was dead again.Oh, did I mention no touchscreen? Yep. Just junky. I would add that I also discovered that ASUS has a wide variety of screen problems in everything from their tablets to this laptop. If your screen cracks internally, you'll be on the hook for it, no warranty. Final note on the screen: I can't believe how cheap and plastick-y it is. I felt like this was a laptop from 2005!Believe me, I SOOOO WANTED to love this laptop. But man... just absolute garbage. Save yourself a disaster.
Very good and good price
After a day of use, the screen has a yellow tint to it. It is terrible. This problem was not in any reviews but easily found when doing a search. I would not recommend this product.
LIGTH and faster . veri nice. excelent batery time
Display is terrible

I like the laptop itself (although I never did get around to checking out the speakers, because of all the problems I had trying to set up the OS the way I wanted (can't be done), getting it to run the software I want to use & accept the file associations I wanted to set). Then there is the fact that Windows 10 is loaded with bloatware you can't uninstall or even disable, all kinds of subscription "services" that just cost you money--including the formerly free games like freecell & solitaire, it collects all kinds of information whether you want it to or not, which you can limit somewhat but not eliminate, & generally just insists on running your computer however it wants to regardless of anything you might want or need.
Just get this MASTERPIECE!!
Good thing.
I have multiple ticket numbers. For some reason, they kept issuing me new ticket numbers for each reply it seems.Here are the few I could dig up.N180117529N180249415N1801139402N1801160374N1801160149N1801136813N1801139635N180335047Only after a couple months of buying a new ASUS ZenBook the touchpad begin failing.In the beginning of January, I filed a ticket to get it serviced due to a failing trackpad.I sent it in. First of all, it's ridiculous I had to pay for shipping but I can deal with that.I explained the problem in detail to support and even recorded a video of the issue. The laptop was sent back and the problem was not addressed. I contacted support and told them they did not fix the problem. I asked them what they did. They said they replaced the trackpad. I told them I had video evidence. They would not admit to this and offered to do another RMA.I agreed to send it in a second time. Again, they assured me it would be fixed. They said I would get priority support.I get it back and the trackpad doesn't click some of the time and now it's physically tilted. It's actually in worse condition. It actually took longer to get the laptop back this second time.I contact them again and asked just to get my money back. They said they cannot do this but said they would send me a replacement laptop. I agreed. This time, DAYS and DAYS go by and it's still in repair status. All they have to do is verify my laptop was received and send me a replacement I thought. I contact this nightmare of a support team and they say they are verifying my laptop has an issue. I ask to escalate the issue multiple time. I am assured it has been. I am now sitting on at least 3 days and have not heard back from a supervisor. They can't tell me who should be contacting me or when. The only thing I'm told is that the supervisor might not be in his office.I have lost countless hours and dollars having to use an old and slow laptop attempting to get things done.ASUS customer service is absolutely horrible.I have multiple ticket numbers. Here are just a few:N180117529N180249415N1801139402N1801160374N1801160149N1801136813N1801139635N180335047
This model has no touch screen and no tablet configuration
I own the UX330 (7th gen), and I love the battery life. I dual boot Ubuntu and run that as my main OS, and I routinely get 12 hours on it. I would highly recommend it for anyone that doesn't need a dedicated graphics card (photo/video editing, gaming) as the battery life is phenomenal.I try to charge it at around 40% and not past 80% to preserve battery life, so I only get about 5-6 hours SOT, but I'm only using 40% of the battery at a time. It charges quickly, 30 minutes or less to get that 40%, and I almost never turn it off, I just let it sleep. I can let it sleep for a couple days and if it drops 1% in that time I'm surprised.The screen angle is a bit annoying, I wish it would go back a bit further (15 degrees more would be great), but its light and it feels durable (not as nice as a macbook, but its half the price).I have had issues sometimes with the trackpad not responding properly, but I believe thats due to Ubuntu. It works wonderfully in Windows, I never have any issues typing in Windows and my hand usually rests on the trackpad, which caused problems with my previous laptop.The USB C is amazing for me, as my phone is USB C, it really makes life easy. Not as big of a plus if you don't have other usb c devices. The mini HDMI is annoying, I still haven't purchased any miniHDMI to HDMI cables.The speakers are in a terrible spot, underneath the laptop, and they're pretty underpowered. Again, in my mind, that would fall under a media machine, which this is not, so its not a deal breaker for me.My girlfriend purchased the 8th gen. It has a slightly more powerful processer, but less battery life. It still lasts a very long time, and she has no complaints.All in all, I love my laptop. Its unbelievably light, and the battery is awesome, and its more than quick enough for anything I use it for, as I don't do anything graphically intensive.
I love this laptop. Coming from a triple-boot MacBook Pro 13" 12,1 I was seriously doubting the ASUS would compete, but I actually like it better.First thing I did was shrink Windows 10 to install Linux on 1/2 the 256 GB SSD. Everything works great in Ubuntu 17.04, except for the fingerprint reader which is an "unknown device" in print and another driver I tried. I don't need the fingerprint reader to work, but it's been flawless everywhere else, and I am a Linux main (work tools).My only gripes could be that the sound is pretty quiet in Windows and though I can get over 100% in Linux it will distort past 100%. Another gripe would be the touchpad isn't as good as my previous MacBook, but that's not much of a surprise. Also the AC power supply is rather cheap, but I couldn't care less about that. If anything I like that I could probably get a generic replacement adapter at Walmart or Goodwill if I need one.The battery life of this ASUS is awesome- I don't need to charge it all day with regular usage. It's very light compared to my MacBook 13". The keyboard is great and just as good as the Apple in my opinion. The screen is great at 1080p, the i5 eigth gen is fast, the disk is fast. This laptop is built well and does not feel as inexpensive as it is.I don't think there is a better laptop in this price range. Seriously check this one out if you need an ultralight!
I bought this since all of my apple products won't run Linux, and well I'm tired of Apple.Overall the build quality is nice for a $750 laptop. The i5 processor is fast enough to get things done (writing software/browsing/minor video editing). 8gb of ram is "ok", but it'd be lovely to have 16gb even if the cost was a bit more as the ram is not upgradable. The SSD is decent but there are faster drives out there, again for the price point not a big deal. 99% of your average consumers won't notice the IO difference between the onboard SSD and something more high end.The reason why I gave it only 4 stars was due to the fact I've had to return this model twice due to screen artifacts and bleeding. I'm not sure if I got 2 bad units in a 6 month span, but either way it's annoying. It's not extremely noticeable but when you're writing code, it can obscure your view.If the screen issues could be resolved, I'd buy another one in a second. Sadly, I'm going to look at other Linux-compatible laptops.Oh and Ps... if you are running Linux a couple of things.1.) Go for Mint, Ubuntu, or Debian as it is supported out of the box2.) If you want that gimmicky fingerprint reader to work, good luck with that lol
I love this computer - lightweight, reasonable, great battery life - but the first one I got had a sticky key right out of the box. Amazon replaced it, but then my next computer has had a chronic track pad problem. Customer service has been helpful but after 2-3 times of being walked through the process of re-setting the driver they told me to do a full system re-set. Took a bunch of time and I had to pay to re-install some software, and then one week later the track pad cut out again. I'm preparing to send it in and at least shipping both ways is covered, but now I'm going to be without my computer for at least two weeks. The trackpad cutting out seems like an issue a couple other users have had based on these reviews, and seeing as it is a problem that presents itself a week or so after it starts working again, I'm really concerned about their ability to resolve this for the long haul. Fingers crossed sending it in works, but these two issues raise some concern for me about the basic quality. I made the switch since Apple laptops have gotten ridiculously expensive, but I have not had these basic quality issues with a brand new computer before. It's still a great computer, but does raise some concern.
I bought this laptop at the beginning of my college semester and i've had it for about 7 months now. It was working really well at first, but after a few months, it started to freeze up more often. Whenever it does, my mouse wouldn't move, any keys i press don't make a difference, and it also produces this strange sound. I would have to restart it every time but its happening more frequently now. As I am a colle student, its essential to have a laptop to use so I'm beginning to think of ditching it and getting a new one from a different brand.
You can't beat the styling, battery life and performance for the price.I got this while I was learning how to program for school.I've been doing some photoshop(GIMP) with it as well as Blender and haven't had a problem. I play HoTS and Hearthstone on it all the time, and some Minecraft(playing Project ozone Lite right now with my wife).Has trouble running WoW but plays most games I throw at it just fine, Don't Starve and Factorio etc.Only down side is that I wished it had more ram.I'm learning Unity3D right now and the 8gb is kind of the bottleneck.
This computer has been such a disappointment. It looks beautiful and is extremely light and portable but it has caused nothing but trouble. Within a year I've had to replace the battery ( with little to no support from Asus despite multiple outreach). Keys regularly stick on the computer. It shuts off randomly and when on sleep mode, will frequently switch itself on and drain the battery over night. I've taken it to multiple people for check up and fixes and other than some serious hardware flaws, no one can quite figure out the problem.I'm quite gentle with my devices. I carry them in cases, I keep them clean and relatively dust free, I update my software including malware protection regularly but for whatever reason, this Asus has continued to be a let down.Not to mention absolutely zero customer service. I will be buying a new computer as soon as I can and not returning to Asus products again.Definitely worth it to just pay $300 more for a macbook air.
Light, fast, thin and good battery life.
Great. Fast laptop. Colors are great. Can handle the programs that were the biggest cpu hogs on my old laptop with ease.
I was shocked about how affordable this is for the specs it has. I love the color, the big screen, the 4 processors, the 1T of memory, and the 16gbs of RAM, but it's already having issues! It sometimes makes a strange, ear piercing, static noise and goes black and takes a while to restart, and from day 1, it easily overheats (even when it's over a hard surface).
Literally the best laptop I've ever owned the 16gb of DDR4 Ram and Quad-core processor makes it very fast at multiple demanding programs like Adobe Creative Suite applications, Sketch, and so much more. I'm happy so far with this machine, HP did a great job with this one.
Graphics are awesome. However, the performance isn't always great. There are frequent updates that can take an hour to finish. When I've set the computer to update and shut down, it's gone on standby while updating multiple times. This means that the next time I want to use the computer, I try to turn it back on and it hasn't finished updating yet, so I can't use it right away. I'm trying to start working from home, so I need a computer that's more reliable than that.Loud fan, as others have commented. The product description when I bought it said that this has a "quiet fan," which isn't true. Also, there have been times when the computer has struggled to perform when all I had open were some Chrome tabs and a Steam game. I didn't expect my game to have poor graphics and start lagging under those circumstances. Seems weird for something that claims to "smoothly run your games and photo- and video-editing applications, as well as multiple programs and browser tabs all at once."Honestly, I wish I hadn't spent so much money on this. But I missed the return window, and it's better than nothing.
This is NOT the laptop pictured... the photos show a machine with a smart card reader and a docking station port... this machine has neither. The specs are right, but don't judge this by the photos.
Terrible battery life. Tons of RAM, but itâs really slow. Updates fail constantly.Disappointed for sure. I wouldnât recommend this product to anyone.
The noise from hard drive and cooling fan are too too loud on this HP. I could not take it. I returned it. Our other HP computers at home are very quite.
Horrible. Shut down, cursor is gone..no fix works. Where do I return on file a complaint? This is the work computer I have ever had
Bought this for my daughter. The only reason she says four instead of five stars is that she is using it for online classes and if she leaves closed for too long it shuts down. She has two young children gets interrupted often.
Itâs been dependable for schoolwork. However it does glitch sometimes when trying to wake it up. Also the log in screen doesnât always appear- which causes you to have to click one of the annoying advertisements in order to get the computer to respond.
Love this little laptop, and you can't beat it for the price. I purchased it as both a backup machine and to have some portability to work in warmer parts of my house during the winter months.I don't need a lot of bells and whistles on my laptops, and this Chromebook does everything I need it to. I am a writer and work all day on my computer; the keyboard is responsive enough without being oversensitive. I purchased a mouse to go with my Chromebook, but so far, I've just been using the trackpad, which is every bit as good as the one on my old Mac.The battery seems to last forever--I think I'm getting about eight hours out of mine, with multiple tabs open and streaming a few hours of video every day.The profile of the Chromebook is slim, and the machine feels very lightweight, yet it is substantial enough to hold on my lap without necessarily using a laptop desk.The screen's resolution is fine for my purposes, although the text size is smaller than what I've been used to, and I'm feeling a little eye strain. I need to see if I can adjust the settings to enlarge browser fonts. That said, most of my time of the Chromebook so far has been surfing the net; normally, I'd be on Google docs more, where presumably I could enlarge the font as needed. The glare-resistant screen makes it easy to work in front of a window. Also, this feature means I don't have to keep adjusting the screen angle when watching Netflix, for example, and changing my position on the sofa (I don't own a TV, so my computers are my entertainment). Fourteen inches seems to be the perfect size--anything smaller, and I think typing would be a challenge.This is a great machine for writing, Internet research and correspondence, and watching Netflix, Youtube, etc. The fanless model is of course quiet, but it still runs cool. I don't really miss a backlit keyboard (the only feature I wanted but couldn't get on my list of preferences), since I mostly type by touch anyway, and I never work in the complete dark. This is basically like having a faster, more comfortable tablet (ready to go in seconds) without having to install a bunch of apps (I'm fine running most things through my browser). I like the pared-down feeling of the Chromebook.So far, so good, and I'm very happy with the purchase. I've had good luck with HP products in the past, so fingers crossed.
We are very happy with the purchase of this Chromebook. My daughter was starting high school and she needed a laptop that she could do homework on nightly. Increasingly, she was using the family desktop or laptop for homework and my husband and I had to compete for computer time! We wanted a trusted name, good functionality and a good price. This was perfect! Now she has her own designated laptop and we didn't break the bank! No more fighting over computer time at our house. This fit the bill!
Bought this for our office computer which only needed to get emails and check backgrounds on the web. Would defiantly recommend for anyone wanting an inexpensive way to surf the web. It's like an Android tablet with a keyboard and large screen. I think this is an excellent value.
This is a wonderful laptop. Just open it up and start working. 10 hr battery life. Streams movies & TV shows great. Tip: Buy a Chromecast too, you won't be sorry. Just remember that to get the biggest bang from a Chromebook it must be connected to the internet. It seriously makes my 2 year old HP windows laptop feel like a dinosaur.
We've had this for about 2 or 3 months now. This is our first Chromebook to replace a regular PC Laptop, we've had several and they just don't seem to last more than a couple of years, they get slow, it seems like a lot of unecessary software. For our needs, just paying bills, surfing the internet, it seemed like this might be worth a try. So far we've been very satisfied, it's fast and slim. Knock on wood, hopefully it lasts a long time and we will forever be Chromebook people.
Starts up fast. Does basic laptop functions. The mouse pad isnt the easiest to use, but for the money, its good value. Super light and easy to transport.
I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and I tried to do my best because I don't know much about computers. Luckily, it seems I did good. He loves it. It is fast, light weight, and has an HDMI connection which the last Chromebook he had did not. He is very happy with the purchase and says he can't tell any major difference between the more expensive Chromebook he uses for work and this one.
Great product, but my 11 year old ran off with it. That's the seal of approval!
Honestly it was a great product and I enjoyed it, great battery life, lighting fast browsing speeds and the simplicity of it made it incredible easy to use and the touch pad was very convenient. The only down side was the operating system, I had no idea chrome os couldn't fun regular PC programs but most times you can find a pretty good substitute in the very extensive chrome os App Store so all in all I love the laptop just wish I did a little more research before I bought it
Great laptop!
Being a Google User the set up was a breeze. Within 10 minutes I had confirmed not only my Google Apps, but was also able to confirm my Netflix, Amazon, Comcast accounts all intact and ready to go.The audio is not as loud as reviews indicated. The keyboard will take a little time to get used too, but they all are. So far I am very pleased. Rate is 4 Stars only because I have only had the unit for a half hour.Even arrived a day earlier than stated.
nice device, works well, met all expectations. It's a great option for someone not requiring Windows.
This Chromebook exceeded my expectations. It's fast and can handle multiple tabs, but is comfortable to type on extensively and gets the job done. The only thing I would ask for otherwise would be for it to feel a little more durable.
I love this computer. It boots quickly, has no noisy fan, it's fast and easy to use. My husband has one too and we both love them. This is a simple computer for someone who loves to browse the web and download pictures. It took me a day or two to learn my way around on it, but now it's easy. All you do is sign in with your gmail address and you're on! Great price for a computer.
Well functioning chromebook. It is a little heavy, but sturdy, too. I like the 14 in. Size. For me, smaller ones are not as comfortable to view.
Nothing to configure or set up if you have an active Google account ... simple and easy connection for your email and other internet applications; reasonably good (though not great) screen resolution but certainly fine for the low price.
I have had this computer for 2 years and it still works good as new. I love the size and a pretty inexpensive laptop for how good it works!
My son loves it!! He said it comes with spyware and antivirus....no need to purchase additional Norton....
I bought two of these for my parents and they absolutely love them! These are perfect for people who like to surf the web and check emails.
Loved the laptop until keyboard stopped working one month after warranty expired.
My daughter loves this
Just as advertised
Grandson's Christmas present and he loves it.
Bought this for my daughter who is a school teacher. She loves it.
Love the responsiveness!! However, l'm not finding a way to connect to my Canon printer.
love it
It arrived exactly as described and timely.
Great chrome book
This is my first chrome book and I think it's great! It's sleek and run fast. I was disappointed to learn after I bought it, you cannot install iTunes on a chromebook.
Itâs perfect for a high school student. I can write papers, and I can watch videos at 1080p60 no problem. You cannot game on it but thatâs not what youâre purchasing here.
Bought this 7 months ago and the screen is going out.
Good for the money
the backlight doesn't work...email the seller. He suggested emailing HP
I have had the product since February 2, 2018. It went out last night on me, just blacked out. I cannot get it to turn on. I have school work to do...bummer!
Great first computer for my middle school student. Light and easy to transport back and forth to school
I love my chromebook! Thank you Leo LaPorte for talking about it so much on your Tech Guy radio and podcast! It is because of you that I bought the chromebook! I can't think of a single thing I don't like about it. I can shop on line, pay bills, email, you tube, tennis channel everywhere app.Audio books. All my favorite things to do with a lightweight,easy to carry laptop
Nice powerful little book, has intel chip so it can be modified with crouton...
Could be more pleased
Nice but low quality camera
Love love love.....I thought it was touch screen tho :( over all love the device.
Just what my son needed. Great product
Great gift for my daughter
Excellent machine
product as described. A great buy!!!
Great bargain and great for online use.
LOVE THIS LAPTOP!!!
This product is lightweight and easy to use.
Awesome piece of technological equipment. Our whole family loves this chrome book!!!
Like the color and size!
For my 12 yr old for school. Timely, good condition. Provides for all of a 12 yr old's needs in and out of the classroom.
So far so very good. This is my 3rd Chromebook and o far I do love it.One con: display is NOT true HD. I bought ii knowing this. My 1st Chromebook is true HD it is very good. This one would be ****** (six) if it were HD.
My 88 yr old mother had always been frustrated with whatever laptop she had at the time. I bought her this to make things simpler for her AND because she was convinced that she would be able to see a white keyboard better than black. She loves this chromebook.
Slim design looks greatFast when connected to strong Wi-Fi
I got rid of my Microsoft PC and have been using this Chromebook as my primary PC since purchasing it.Its fast and screen size is great with really good graphics quality, I dont miss the Microsoft software updates or the hassles of anti virus software.
Long Battery Life. Pretty good sound for laptop speakers, and pretty durable build construction. There's no lag for Facebook, Netflix streaming, etc.Can't beat it for the price.
Bought it for my brother and he loves it !! It's lightweight enough to take to class and durable enough to survive his backpack. LOL. Turns on super fast and he is able to have multiple tabs open without a decrease in performance. Highly recommended.
What a phenomenal laptop for the price.Great screen, lightening fast, really nice looking, the almost instant on and off feature is a wonderful feature when you are in a hurry.The 14 inch screen is the perfect size for carting around, I am extremely happy with it, and all for around $200.I highly recommend.
I was very disappointed that it was not the laptop shown on the description.
Amazing laptop at an amazing price. The only problem I have is certain programs are not supported.
Laptop failed after 2 months of use. It would turn on but the screen was always black. HP customer support site was terrible and took forever to work through all the steps. None of the recovery steps worked.
So far I really love this notebook. I bought one of the first generation Chromebooks and even though I understood that it was meant purely for accessing the internet I was disappointed. I then bought an ASUS Chromebook that only lasted about 8 months. It just went black one day and I couldn't get it to come back on. Fortunately they aren't too expensive. THIS HP Chromebook is amazing. It allows me to play games of all kinds, it's fast ---- there's just nothing to complain about.
great computer as long as you realize you are buying a chrome book. works great for me would definitely recommend.
I ordered my Chromebook next day delivery and Amazon delivered.It works flawlessly and I couldn't be more pleased.
The Chromebook itself is lovely! My daughter loved it, however the display went off totally after 2 months of use and wouldn't ever come back on, so we had to return it.
I just started using this computer for school and after the 2nd use, the computer will not turn on at all!! For buying this laptop brand new, this is not acceptable!
Great little machine. Easy to use. Am still learning. Thank you.
Bought one last year I think and have been very pleased with it for just surfing the net. Only thing it did was once in a while it would power off in the middle of something, but i pressed the on key and it came back up. Hope this doesn't mean something might go wrong in the future. If it does, it's given me plenty of service for what i paid
does all that my older laptop did and works much faster
an amazing computer
Very nice chromebook
Great computer, have a toshiba chromebook, but this is just as good.
2nd computer/laptop purchased on Amazon that right out of the box is defective. What is going on? This is very upsetting, never thought Amazon would sell defective technology,
My husband and I bought a pair of Chromebooks. It took all of 30 seconds to set these up before we were surfing the web. They are basic but that is all we were looking for. Browsing, shopping, banking, emailing, Youtubeing and facebooking. I had to Google how to right click because it only has a touch pad, no left or right click. I still haven't figured out how to copy and paste, but I haven't had a need so I am sure I can figure it out. It is a great product for basic use and the price is awesome!
Love how the chromebook works, no fuss!
Nice price and works well. Thin and light.
Loved my first Chromebook so much, I had to buy this one for my wife since she was always borrowing mine instead of her Windows laptop LOL
The space bar barely works on far left side.No-wonder its only $200.
The computer itself functions just fine but the screen resolution isn't the best in bright spaces, the camera isn't great but it has a fww filters so that's pretty awesome, the battery life is very good it takes about 1 hour or 2 to get full charge if you start charging it with about 5% or 7% battery life, you can have quite a lot of pages open in the internet and it won't slow down, also the speakers are more than i expected for this price, they are pretty loud also the chromebook itself is made of plastic so it isn't heavy but the fact that it's plastic doesn't make it look cheap. I would say this product is good for the price that it has, i would definetly recommend it for teens or for a laptop that you would just have for entertainment scince it doesn't include any microsoft programs. Please rate this review if you thought it was helpful, have a nice day.
Bought this for my daughter to use for school work. She really likes it. Nice design. Great for students.
Enjoying my Chromebook.
I thought it was going to play android apps.
no os, or inoperable
I've had this laptop a little over 4 months and it already has quit scrolling, it's annoying and unusable to me and I'll never use another HP product in my life :(
We purchased this laptop for our son to be able to connect to his homeschool website and perform the various activities expected of him on a daily basis.One of the biggest parts is the daily "class connect" sessions that uses JAVA software to connect him live to his teacher and fellow classmates. With all the research we did before purchase, it was never brought to our attention that Chrome 45 and later no longer support Java, thus making it impossible for him to log on everyday.Therefore we had to return this laptop so that we can repurchase one that does support JAVA, since it is such a critical part of his curriculum.Which was unfortunate, besides the problem stated above it seemed to be a perfect fit for us, him, and our wallet.
Sent it to my mom and she was up and running game in 5 minutes, easy to use and very attractive and durable.
I love this product and it came on time as mentioned.
Wife loved her birthday surprise.
So im traveling and since frontier airlines doesn't have wifi is there any other way to watch movies on my chrome laptop?Is there a way of downloading movies to your USB ?
Love it
I'd put 0 stars but not an option... recd mid Aug; died Oct 25th... really!
I am so disappointed with this product. To start with, it takes a very long time to connect to my wifi at home. I'm not sure why. At home we have an iMac and Macbook, which all start up immediately when turned on. This morning alone, I had to input my password four times in order for it to connect and it never happened. When it had connected during this week, the processing is very slow and takes a very long time, minutes, for each new tab to upload. I don't have that kind of time when a Mac gives me immediate service. I'm sending it back, not worrying about the cost of a Mac, and heading to the store to purchase a new one. I'm a HUGE fan of all things Google and was really wanting to fall in love with the Chrome Book. I'm so upset.
It's fast. It's clean. But I didn't know and didn't see anyone anywhere mention that with a chromebook, you can't download other browsers easily. I also don't like that there's not a caps lock button. Not used to that, and when I hit where it usually is, it brings up a google search box. The price is right and the quality is pretty good, but I don't like having google chrome as my browser overlord. Battery life is good though. And it's pretty lightweight.
Sent it back the same day, hated it!!!
great value
Love it.
I really dislike this operating system. It's not compatible with almost any apps. It's very difficult to print with and the app set up is annoying. It you're used to a windows computer, I wouldn't suggest getting this.
i'm in love with my chromebook!! arrived so fast! thank you so much:)
Buyer beware: this hunk of junk cannot skype. It has a camera, and it is 2016, so logic would suggest that it can, it cant. Chrome just doesn't allow it. I will be selling this at a loss and replacing with a full feature laptop. This should only be purchased for internet browsing.
