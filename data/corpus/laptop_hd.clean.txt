overall great gaming laptop people afford spend lot money high end gaming machines many good things laptop powerful enough handle pretty much anything throw ease speakers solid enough get job done n't expect anything blow away far issues overheating playing games although minor cons laptop , power build quality definitely make worth purchase one issue laptop screen worst screen ever see far mediocre second , laptop bit heavy understandable given power getting lastly , battery life could better around 5 hours light usage battery life screen better , would basically perfect laptop
top notch condition , running smoothly plays games throw really good bang buck color best intend video editing

great laptop price , loaded rating go hour updates played overwatch ultra settings much sacrifice performance come much bloatware like finish chassis
first received pc amazing best bang buck pc could find ran games max settings around 60fps mind treat pc like god nice cooling stand never moves desk game leave desktop regular computer needs ive pc 3 months cant play demanding games without cpu 100 causing major happen first games like 60 gpu usage 100 cpu usually bottleneck gpu reason cpu pc task application cpu games causing happen cpu major bottleneck always 100 usage
live model expensive , bought amazon international shipment fast safe , appreciated first time buying laptop international shipment , satisfied first always expect would damage machine shipping , obviously used laptop almost 1 week , far every things works normal smooth , experience using laptop great use little gaming , internet , typing comment amazon keyboard great , cooling system powerful enough machine , sometimes little bit loud big deal , ips panel already good enough need already replaced desktop , feel satisfied bought
rather disappointed device plays games high settings occasional frame drops \( provided n't get hot \) however , compared macbook pro \( 2012 \) used use gaming \( yes , really \) , thing piece crap pathetic cpu performance want listen music spotify youtube gaming \? forget open program game fix cpu 100 real time audio garbage due drivers manage play music \( sound matter \) , occasionally ear pops clicks unreliable internet default web browser ie , boy suck however , chrome \( switched soon purchasing \) faster reason find better use another computer want stable web browsing battery cord disconnects easily due weight minor annoyance problems new switching old mac , makes wonder n't invest better laptop considering purchasing satisfactory gaming laptop , strongly urge consider spending hundred better device worth patience good luck
pros 1 runs games fine couple frame drops every mostly everything smooth 1060 max q gpu handle current titles settings n't expect max settings newest aaa titles 2 've also used edit short videos handles without much hiccup either 3 've seen complaints screen purposes , 've found quite clear 4 battery life decent plugged n't tested long last 've used web browsing youtube unplugged 3 hours later still around 50 battery life suspect get 6 hours light moderate use cons 1 's little big heavy around long time n't ideal 2 keyboard n't best use lenovo series work might bad point comparison 3 screen around around \( close inch \) ca n't fault considering price , great laptop possibly best value money 's price point !
laptop great color viewing angles price imo dell \( true ips monitor \) , calibrated 3 pro said saying laptop good screen money colors fine , rgb fine , great price laptop imo keyboard mechanical switched keyboard , bad , n't complaints personally ran heaven benchmark extreme got score , nothing overclocked played cs go , far cry , everything ran played great
n't laptop long love handles games ease 's super fast n't understand people saying fan loud , laptop pretty quite far gotten warm hot , 's easy fix battery life great normal use leave plugged heavier use cannot comment long goes gaming think great little laptop 're expecting tower pc might disappointed laptop one good buy i'm happy
everything amazing handles gta v ultra settings around 70 fps typically great gaming laptop , 10 10 , ive seen laptops specs go thousands dollars
originally going buy msi gl62m laptop waiting laptop ship , saw one instead around price laptop included stronger gpu around performance areas laptop looking laptop strong hardware work , also use gaming activity hit sweet spot pros 1060 6gb 7th gen i5 works gaming still professional look fingerprint scanner \( n't mentioned description \) great though description says 8gb ram , wish specified 2x 4gb ram ordered another 8gb stick try upgrade laptop 16gb ca n't add additional 8gb stick slots laptop taken 4gb sticks ram pretty frustrating
computer great price , 's list pros cons , student gamer might help others pros great gaming battery life considering 's gaming laptop great fast quiet \( cooling keyboard extremely quiet \) red backlit keyboard \( studying late night , ultra white bother eyes , ones n't \) lightweight gaming screen definitely best sound n't loud enough , good , knew buying never bothered battery charger little big taste , everything fit big backpack n't think weight going much issue , 's i'm always go price , would definitely recommend laptop \( would 've loved dedicated buttons mouse pad , 's concern \)
bought i5 version laptop \( w q \) use \( hot place temps \) laptop performs extremely well games get 100 fps overwatch ultra settings doom gives 100 fps , cpu temps peak gpu exceeds load laptop also well designed threw 16gb samsung ram around , swapped m2 drive overall , pleased product
personally , problems another notebook manufacturer past , big care customers , online service especially awful tech manufacturer said , notebook excellent , beautiful design , fancy looking , impressive combination 7th gen i5 cpu awesome gtx 1060 vga decent gaming notebook without flashy edges , red lights , silly fingers never need customer support
great laptop handle aaa titles high max settings , compared 2x laptop laptop competition price recommendations upgrade 16gb ram \( cheaper ! \) either play get external screen tearing makes laptop \( laptop \) experience
, bought late february 2018 , 4 17 18 button like reviews , broken completely disappointing , dell dropped standards apparently
box works perfectly great performance price , 'd even say best bang buck gaming laptop market , however , means machine feels cheap n't rgb , monitor , 's solidly constructed feels premium though slight annoyance fan quite loud times , 's enough make star thoroughly recommend laptop

first 900 gaming machine purchased , dell actually fast play triple games im 5 star
powerful good substitute desktop
problems device among heat produced much higher expected reviews mentioned good thermal solution , problem playing two hours device gives continue games session , another issue device brings two 4gb ram usually usually comes one 8gb leaving slot free add another necessary case must buy two need 16gb ram , network card hand quite slower expected since card another device gives quite good speed however barely helps web browsing , tried reinstall drivers previously updated effect , otherwise everything fine guess defects machine occur devices series however point take account since launch equipment defects without previous

i'm writing review since reviews read past cover wanted know laptop ill comparing older laptop got rocking 960m 6th gen i5 laptop also 15 6 inch ips display rgb much higher quality desktop , dell ips display think somewhere around 50 rgb colors look washed bad tn panel despite 15 inch laptop inch longer old laptop , users described problems using also heavier little cumbersome carry around trackpad good , enjoy actually productivity work without need mouse great , touchpad older laptop garbage keyboard , keys feel thin flimsy cant type fast id like issues gaming first person whenever need jump move forward \( ctrl w space \) 7300hq seems able handle whatever want throw got browser test 130 1060 max q ability max game tried far good framerates fans kick really loud depending game section keys get really hot touch play battery limit 30fps game run reasonable cool quiet games ive tested really demanding games like 1080 issues 60fps battery old laptop would get 2 3 hours non gaming use battery 30 mins game , older games era like modern games basically cant use unplugged dell hand able run 8 10 hours non gaming use depending brightness \( 40 60 \) \( 100 brightness got 6 hours \) really good gaming laptop also another thing note browsing youtube typing stuff fans wont kick laptop noise bother others library setting gaming battery would get little less 3 hours older games like 90 minutes demanding modern games like possible quick gaming session go plug found bottom want buy laptop recommend buy costco currently 750 right , add 8 gigs ram add 1tb drive \( cost extra 100 \) looking fully loaded laptop 850 going game plugged also recommend download geforce experience drivers set mode laptop wont try kill giving 100 fps expense getting hot like engine taking mode reduces work gpu give locked 60 fps games laptop run cooler
awesome build quality nice sleek plastic aluminum gaming performance \( gtx 1060 max q , i5 , 8gb ram etc \) price best cooling probably get max q 1060 laptops running tasks browsing youtube , watching streams using anything video reads pretty accessible compared gaming fans get loud playing games really issue use headphones etc bit heavier expected laptop huge better sales dell website although pay attention
ok , screen little uncomfortable
plan playing demanding games , recommend using good quality headphones fans often kick soon game , stay 5 10 minutes looked online try find way cut back fan speed , often need spin fast \( thermals great device \) appears dell designed machine always fans spin relatively quickly playing games aside minor issue , laptop great purchase , perfect anyone looking reliable , well built machine disappointed !
good video card n't dvd rom vga port empty space left right screen also nice touch pad smooth
great build quality poor battery life 're looking get model go i7 version
screen awful , worst 300 dollar screen specs screen limited \? computer freezes often , seems sluggish bought used , doubt return money back anyways sitting
ok plays games great images little distorted moving mouse much overall recommend getting pc planning strictly playing games !

nice product
first , laptop runs really well runs steam library pretty well , generally pretty snappy navigating desktop however , trackpad feels little weird slow \( 'll probably get used soon \) , screen wrong angle , lighting colors way though , 's solid laptop , definitely upgrade lenovo somehow made way college really reason n't get 5 star review week got computer , kept getting crash loop bsod telling memory management error , could n't use computer 30 seconds crashed pulled old laptop \( i'm currently writing review \) looked ram see loose something , even switched slot kept crashes due memory luckily , boy dell support phone messing around chassis dell sending new ram stick free charge i'm little wo n't using laptop week least customer support good still would suggest getting laptop aware might issue , might worth ordering another 8gb ram computer returning free later n't need good one people , happy shopping
good item
would say get 's 800 dollars ca n't go wrong gaming laptop play games 's best experience get display trash n't bother using display ssd low end n't expect blazing fast boot run programs like expected 's good stuff build quality really good laptop thing light power supply upgrade removing screw back add ram replace ssd hard drive
laptop performs reasonably well , surface material easily may seem trivial matter n't like way always looks touch fingerprint clearly seen always cleaning !
honest , worst mistake could made buying dell computer searched much internet , read convinced buy model total loss money beginning super slow , technical support dell tried help phone , nothing month half ago completely went turn anymore apparently certain point reflect failure technical support made send repair center , lasted almost month arrived last week two days later went turn , ! called make return , want computer anymore , possible two days coming repaired damaged \? say send back repair \( \) return please , waste money buying computer slow , poor quality technical support

amazing product , best laptop 've ever fast recent games 2016 2017 run max high settings

tech savvy guy would thought 32 gb hard drive would sufficient run windows wrong reviewers noted , even enough space install updates makes sense , quick search ssd vs hdd laptop ssd rather hdd ssd requires much memory operate windows hdd , faster order run windows storage , minimum size ssd recommended 128gb obviously , returning
impressed system fast majority hard space filled getting storage warning days installed chrome must spend lot time setting cleaning
runs way slow comes bunch useless apps take space n't know ones delete get space n't know 're plan return
buy computer probably fine , 32 gb hard drive small unable download install windows updates , even deleting stuff included imagine would make fine linux machine , absolutely use windows machine since room updates
love super light easy use little slow browsing multiple pages open storage pretty quickly great buy
like others posted , enough memory windows 10 , read carefully specifications 'll likely use social media etc

overall great laptop price runs well without serious lag issues run low graphic games without issue real complaints keyboard backlit , annoying using second complaint cannot open laptop one handed light pick whole thing instead lifting screen

never many problems computer 've constant problems connecting wifi ways app works \( n't work \) mouse vs stylus regret buying thing

love computer
good laptop , good quality ratio
good , works well , fast
bad poor quality screen , even tn panel main problem trackpad drivers paper clip ready reset computer acer worried getting warranty information product n't work n't expect work straight box
price , good computer however made small os upgrade win10 home edition win10 edition , screen brightness keys work acer 's tech support 's advice reset computer original os fix problem low rating product support rather product difficult produce necessary software patch
laptop arrived , looks would probably get 3 5 's somewhere middle cheap laptop , accents found expensive models built quality design , similar 300 500 laptops like mentioned , viewing angles screen n't best , 's , sitting front , 's quite ok ! like fn keys \( screen brightness \) cursor keys , instead standard number f keys speakers sound nice laptop kind comes 2 hours worth uninstalling , vs 8 hours 'd laptops mostly crap comes windows installation , firefox , trial norton something , acer specific software really n't serve purpose device definitely slow harddrive , results laggy device upgrade ssd \( 60 120 \) , device work quite well ! , screen , poor viewing angles however , 're one using , screen looks quite good 's definitely bright enough usage colors ok say , blacks n't really black , looks like cheaper screen rest , problems wifi , browsing , gaming \( well 1080p \) ram supposedly upgradeable either 8 32gb , 6gb really need day day usage price , 's great device , blows older professional laptops 10x price , water \( performance wise \) probably serve well 4 6 years lifetime laptop \( reason go expensive asus sony laptop 4 years , keep laptops 4 5 years max \) guess , laptop windows 10 , 's good thing !
perhaps 's i'm middle slowing n't understand anyone think slow computer 's fastest 've owned i3 priced 350 range n't going run 700 machines plan use one data storage access , main machine end , setting simple information , online data searches , e mail , blog posting \( pictures , text running \) far breeze fast enough , plenty storage , good set ports including vga cd dvd drive works perfectly nice addition , relatively new laptop include one windows 10 pre installed usual bloatware , easily uninstalled speakers actually sound pretty good , though i'm headphones guy would never judge laptop sound system battery life exceptional , making ideal travel machine two issues 1 \) genuinely dual channel setup 4 gb 2gb \( kind processing \) likely wo n't matter many budget customers , speed plenty fast , think claiming dual channel bit misleading faster single channel 6 gb ok , i'm little picky 2 \) screen n't best looks bit dull , frankly , kind like old screens found old toshiba laptops years ago 're trying save money laptop still need deep , clear , saturated color , 'd recommend looking elsewhere price , e 15 competitive machine 's fast enough enough storage , ports , dedicated number pad , responsive enough touch pad i'm finding easy use \( using two commands pad especially good machine \) backlit keys better screen , would stellar laptop needs would likely make office main machine , 's great backup would perfect student computer long graphics n't terribly important heck , even looks great first acer likely wo n't last
laptop absolutely cute , amazing performance , nice design , lovely full hd screen powerful processor , even play heavy games laptop , 10x acer
really slow n't buy
slow , due windows configured waste time 5400 hdd , n't even bother recognize dram proper spec dram chipset cpu clearly would support ddr4 bios terrible almost non existent nvme 2 socket advised sata supported screen acceptable bad viewing angle poor ca n't even get tint background way across screen sent back wo n't buying another acer support material terrible printed text small need 8th gen i3 adequate , system lacking detail dram timing delivered 11 11 11 28 perhaps acer fix next glad n't spend get i5 screen way
works well little slow

bought cheap replacement previous tablet lost 'll start saying use primarily watch movies surf net , 're looking review handles intensive gaming , n't right box , thing need windows 10 update prepared give least 24 hours go entire update n't fault device , 's slightly annoying thought could fire thing get started favor get started soon take box , plug , connect internet save time road windows updates released graphics little thing pretty awesome stream amazon prime movies quality playback superb big plus usage fits perfectly airplane tray table still leaves room , especially keyboard leave bag \( need unless 're typing , screen double purpose n't lot typing \) keyboard sturdy n't feel cheap provides nice , protective cover attached folded keys responsive integrated trackpad mouse works expected added micro sd card 64 gb expand storage pics 're crystal clear fact , images better depth contrast view desktop front facing camera would expect device price range microphone picks sound pretty well 're speaking within 4 5 feet screen skype kids without much issue prefer using video chatting using phone see better bigger screen 're thinking using business video , probably better quality options one downside \( far \) sound produced device speaker pretty awful try listen straight device described tinny definitely , stereo connected bluetooth headphones device sound good way 're thinking lie around bed watch stuff , would recommend headphones otherwise 'll miss lot background stuff due low thing
update returned unit came back make sure gave one star lines screen never went away waking sleep , pressing would correct , next time line screen would take whole screen literally hate keyboard first couple times even holding unit , keyboard foot man hurt cannot even hold , open , barely use unit keyboard falls way easy even use keyboard around opening unit separate keyboard tablet causing problems usage would much rather 2017 version hard keyboard much like laptop may , really feel strongly dislike keyboard setup display sleep lines running could read display hate return things , one might go keeps n't used much yet , unit appears slow respond often read slow tablets barely noticed , one slow ! , three windows open clicking thing thinking open

n't buy worth money
wi fi capability unlike stated product description
similar item , , , waste time , n't even kept week , turned turn back , windows installed ! ! look around found n't old windows version installed case back needed done , 's reason came back windows ! nothing , ! returned fast could !
received today , loaded windows updates downloaded office add comments anything goes wrong , money , ca n't beat machine old travel laptop finally died hate spending lots money travel machine need basics refuse travel laptop requires cloud function properly may pull 4gb ram put 8gb card , 's later oh , noticed several people complained track pad downloading updates , noticed one track pad update pad seems work well pc update
laptop gamers need powerful editing programs couple steps chromebook , couple steps expensive powerful units great need basics want chromebook provides large amount storage space ended around windows pre installed programs already built also slot sd card need want space dvd cd drives becoming thing past , nice one built unit consider huge plus travel lot like , might want go smaller screen 15 inch screen difficult pack carry along go complaint \( far \) quality track pad best , recommend getting another mouse
almost week love plenty hard drive space , disc drive best part 's crappy chromebook 's got everything need price right recommend anyone , especially live
bottom line , basic laptop expect , wo n't disappointed one thing really fact loaded mcafee anti virus software month , expired , began receiving daily messages purchase mcafee protect computer still getting day ugh quality build lackluster , par pay plastic , cheap , efficient enough , casual home office user good traveling one best features laptop dvd drive 's cheap flimsy , need delicate , 's great option
bought laptop beginning 2018 's cheap , yet decent price , refurbished laptop however , , found n't set \( box experience \) , computers initially set , customize settings create user account , certain things n't work , like start windows button somewhat unusable state , complete reinstall windows \( thankfully , i'm computer tech trade , already done stuff plenty times \) also , upgraded memory 4 8 gb terrible get apart many screws worry pretty much pry plastic shell bottom get electronics also , side note , single half sheet paper included laptop fine , part microsoft works , office , current productivity software bit head works trying , i'm sure happened despite , laptop looked fine , n't tech , imagine frustration 'd going
hardware ok software disabling hp services removing everything called mcafee helps 2 running parallel \( ms one mcafee top \) kills 1 3 performance without even anything
wish would read reviews bought others saying problems within week two mine defective right box ! got set froze would n't anything said sign bad trying replace old laptop n't deal stuff like shipping back asap ! waste time
within week small problem update installed contacted hp customer service said \( \) longer 90 day software warranty would n't help even though knew purchased new told lot could expect future , sent back , never buy hp products
real disappointment build uses cheap parts found many hours trying one usb ports fully function , devices work others n't took long time figure , warranty peripherals , work fine machines cheaply built
days , personally , think perfect computer need however slower used sure get go little faster bit help response rate course pretty slow perhaps make item soon future buyers least take market fix speed pc time tell

bought laptop needed replace long dell sits desk used day taken home n't need real powerhouse need something diagnostics remote desktop home needed seem quality machines comfortable asus laptops knew would n't using windows fact windows home issue keeping windows , would went one pro already upgraded enterprise took 5400 rpm drive windows installed replaced ssd drive laptop easy access hard drive ram installed ubuntu 17 04 peripherals use \( wireless , lan , display , trackpad , audio \) work n't try get fingerprint reader working pros powerful price i5 , 8gb ram , access replace hard drive works month warranty pretty standard electronics 30 day replacement amazon n't required use warranty cons going closing opening lid multiple times every day , would worry hinge area feels like every sub 500 laptop , windows home pro laptop n't use windows , would expect something labeled pro business ability join box con drive area could better utilized space second storage drive put laptops crap break use would buy laptop use case
fast boot hard drive fast enough good screen resolution pre installed extras software supplied asus installed poorly seem add functionality full keyboard great

bought asus p series use daily driver work personal productivity stuff 2 months pretty happy laptop pulled hd replace ssd using old laptop i'm getting pretty good response laptop dual monitor setup work able continue use hdmi video vga video output ports gen 7 i5 nice sweet spot fit finish 500 bucks i'm ok travel everyday back forth work laptop long decent size bag \( large enough messenger bag \) good go since thing plastic decent laptop slot bag good would suggest pick laptop sleeve extra protection made backup image win 10 build shipped reinstalled machine linux mint , running like champ issues two projects left finish planned changes laptop 16gb ram \( big deal comes single 8gb dim \) need order another 8gb dim ready last change would like included optical drive install second internal storage device , maybe even 1tb drive came back \( 5400rpm drive , made sad \) build completed 500 worth cash complaint far plastic case bit finger print magnet huge deal give wipe week
've using computer since 2017 1st computer received n't work , amazon cool enough send new one 2nd computer received n't work , next , went asus customer service sent warranty , returned without problem fixed , send back second time got back , works better start installing programs , keeps crashing , restart computer , seems ok well , wrong programs often stop responding crash sometimes n't wake sleep mode 've tried different web browsers , uninstall reinstall programs , viruses , cloud space storage etc good i'm frustrated computer regret buying pros preloaded junk programs , cd player , lots ports \( hdmi \) , size actually like plastic body 's easy clean sound system ok usually use headphones anyway
everything laptop nice , except keyboard normally type pretty fast , keyboard type quickly drops keys even keystrokes many times shift key n't work way keyboard works correctly type slowly , ridiculous bought cheap amazon basics usb keyboard everything fine , laptop worthless without functioning keyboard !
cons thing piece junk day 1 ship 1 stick ram 5400 rpm hard drive cpu dual core i5 magical hyper threading absolutely nothing , least could split memory 2 stick configuration dual channel speed n't ! ddr4 pricing also beyond luckily , paid return shipping label probably expensive keyboard trackpad use usb mouse bluetooth cheap , wifi trying use keyboard shows signs wear within first 3 months machine sold may well kit laptop useless windows 10 , without solid state drive without 16gb 32gb ddr4 2 stick configuration thing netbook never could burn fire give money back fluid free put video pros ubuntu 18 works perfectly except wifi bluetooth problem operating system asus also losing market share poor selling piece garbage receive replacement buying msi laptop instead
using laptop week feel really good value money packaging good , look feel great , display renders crisp images pre loaded windows 10 , though something want , nevertheless , quite quick boot run tests n't see problem regular applications two things complaint 1 mouse pad respond way want n't know settings change feel , default settings leave lot desired 2 placement status leds placed front edge laptop hence visible normal working position ! ! ! , check caps lock , either bend look tilt laptop see front edge kind ui design expert decides things , wonder \? !
price great laptop mainly use work , i'm using anything would require lot processing power , issues runs quickly smoothly also , 's good looking laptop comes lot little costs would definitely recommend laptop anyone needs solid computer work school
decent low end full service laptop comes without junk often find low ends , n't spend lot time removing bloatware purchased basic laptop use internet , word processing email primarily would purchase intention watch videos screen intensive uses screen display subpar compared others refresh rate rather slow says 1080p seems less like fingerprint scanner since able enter multiple people n't rely everyone remember end , get pay good value
good computer overall , sleek fast however n't know used benchmark get 9 hours battery life , i'm lucky get 2 heaven help forget turn close lid good college computer , needs plugged every use
great work computer use constantly office go battery life around 9 hours issues far speed goes , let start saying i'm pc gamer comparing built pc naturally would slower , even someone used using high end gaming pc everyday computer speed issues first computer turned prior significant amount updating laggy moments soon updates finished 've problem great fingerprint reader works well
pros cheap performance low cost bring ram option go 32g max battery life good running ubuntu 16 04 2 n't get hot lap \( although n't lot yet \) running windows 10 , fingerprint scanner nice dvd rw drive , nice old tech lives sd cart slot go pro devices sd card slots display bright clear cons ca n't judge keyboard backlight , think make decision buy also find laptop tend show finger print smudges pretty easy also n't like 0 10 key
pros work features 'll need \( dvd burner , plenty usb slots , hdmi , ethernet \) keyboard full size works great little extra security works perfectly linux \( tried linux mint , , \) cons 's bit bulky \( probably dvd drive \) plastic construction extremely slow n't replace hard drive fingerprint reader works poorly linux 's security anyway \( works great windows \)
wanted wait months reviewed 've experience cheaper laptops short lived , far one fine though like quite lot 's faster led believe reviews , yes could use memory 's problem , least far bought mainly traveling since prefer desktop home , made 3 trips , 's worked fine !

monitor connections began fail 2 months purchase , requiring put pressure bottom bezel see anything screen hard drive started fail tried file insurance claim purchased amazon would still manufacturers warranty contacted asus , told cover hardware stuck unusable laptop neither manufacturer insurance paid extra service probably purchasing asus products amazon 's insurance matter
good guess thing wanted specs , seems always running bit slow 've trouble shot many issues sometimes get working speed first 3 months , 70 percent time , runs like 5 year old computer
n't expect fancy laptop looking reliability dell poor reliability many times sent repair decided change since last inspiron 17 5000 failed 14 months \( disappointing \) first time asus i'm satisfied even less week , think adding memory must intel graphics worked smoothly without , easy setup unlike usb c ports adapters cause problems bloatware \( thank \) upgrade windows 10 initial setup , lets see reliability future good price !

surprised nice bargain priced laptop could screen bright sharp , keyboard crisp , case sturdy almost instant loading , opposed mechanical hard drives fantastic fact writing review acer issues windows 10 installed would advise anyone purchasing laptop remove bloat ware comes ie apps like game , news , programs definitely slow slow 'd watching stream 'd media nearly impossible acer 's fault , removed win 10 junk , , machine dream would nice memory even bloat stuff removed , 12gb 's left use n't heavy programs machine , 's low fine though would look external needed would buy another
great machine price similar acer bit rough 2gb ram great machine bought one replace acer makes good budget product , opinion zero problems would better buy could purchase machine windows 10 lower price

want computer going work couple months , money waste , go ahead get one however , warned , made enough memory actually complete necessary updates even though bought computer three months ago , i'm fully expecting replace soon unfortunately incredibly tech savvy liked easy use , n't make enough money throw away electronics i'm already searching one last longer months , hopefully well worth hard earned money
6 using product , turned one day found left side screen black shadow vertical lines contacted acer , customer service person , informed dropped unit cracked screen informed 70 years old went placed side next told send back , would also told box would coming return waiting week box , purchased one , followed instructions , \( lap top bunch bubble wrap cost 17 02 shipping ups days received call , item cracked , would happy repair 120 00 explained situation rep told happened would cover satisfied product , answer , would never purchase product fairly new laptop hooked tv view anything
acer aspire 1 excellent value considering 's affordable cost fine companion dell desk top
enough memory operating power two tabs open even bought extra memory every time use says needs space waste money need browse ca n't get shopping amazon
works , 's pc , battery life seems great , 's incredibly slow things maybe i'm bad judge 've macbook pro 's years , even web browsing feels slow great exterior finish , still plastic , n't feel great display opens flat , i'm sure 'd ever want laptop flat , guess unfortunately n't open way 360 degrees though
's light cheap machine strong enough handle windows opening 3 tabs starts complaining low memory chrome os , might different story tempted install ubuntu , emmc storage going headache decided return low memory errors
basically put chrome two small programs computer together n't even 1 gb 's trying factory reset said n't even enough memory free even 1 gb programs added already space also disc drive
work box , wifi would connect home network devices connected including 10 year old laptop love also note amazon acer customer service experience absolutely horrible , spoke 5 different , speak someone u would transfer level 2 support acer items think require customer support think best buy brick stopped carrying products
've lot problems product ca n't seem get onto right right try days
well liked first 3 days started freezing arrow would work , would pop message said , pc missing information drivers need restart fix , would n't fix anything ! sent back currently waiting new \( new \) laptop ! ! !
like size wifi speed screen image knew memory would small , portable drives attached saving files need something relatively light fast emails sharing documents would sufficient however used keep many files dropbox modify list would save device price , perfect
installed itunes music removing bloatware enough memory w 32 gb hard drive waste time money
previous acer computers great one much see acer heading way dell understand purchase , recommended lower quality product meet price points two apple vs dell worth almost \?
amazing laptop especially price ! light , compact , full hd screen \( viewing angles also great , despite tn \) , everyday simple tasks , office tasks , browsing web , watching videos , even play light games , valley issue comes limited storage 32 gigs \( quickly \) 4 gigs ram \( multitasking , even 2 3 programs barely possible , windows 10 really requires least 8 gigs \) still , would say 's best price range
bought dad birthday ! old school kept trying screen thinking touch screen , haha uses lot way better little one also lot faster ! advanced computer laptop person , one may best dad turned 51 right ! nothing fancy
arrived defect returned acer since amazon wo n't take returns unless doa sent back original packaging repaired arrived god awful package none paperwork came took three customer even listen problem hope nothing goes wrong n't return warranty info anything else came
turn try enough 32gb store update go bios install locked
worth wanted able use microsoft word excel simple online tasks slow constantly install security updates promptly tells storage capacity way use
brand new computer , enough memory even load updates got guy look check problem supposed \? 200 drain
thing shut days use sending back recommend trying cut corners future purchases , spend extra 200 300 dollars decent laptop
p scam windows breaks shortly buying windows 10 needs 32 run couple updates broken computer doesnt work acer wont make right , windows wont make right amazon wont make right product scam 220 dollars ! im never buying another acer product period done shopping amazon product completely trust acer amazon buy scam !
probably one first order wanted reasonable price basic portable laptop good screen , product description said ips , ordered moment turned , turned started return process , screen quality certainly ips
memory 0 pics videos machine , hardly documents yet , n't even enough memory windows 10 update also , battery lasts 30 minutes mouse little , even adjusting like light weight like typing keyboard starts quick like best however , would buy due memory battery
fastest processor often gets bogged running multiple programs , expected price good investment someone needs simple machine minor tasks
product several one disk drive installed another downfall way increase storage space , 200 \? pretty cheap ask would recommend anyone
bought computer 6 months ago starts keeps restarting even allow reset ! computer use says 1 month ! ridiculous 6 months used enough wear 45 minutes day tops
32g near big enough win 10 even reset without adding sd card machine felt decent seemed work ok size hard drive look something least
n't used much 's great size weight perfect need
purchased march 6 bit dust march 24 power charge called acer went troubleshooting told would ship would without college laptop laptop 6 weeks returned i'm going find something else known issue
received paper weight os loaded laptop wear tear well used laptop shipped back soon received
constantly getting limited space errors hard disk large enough support routine windows updates machine turned really regret purchased
needs 4gb ram definitely needs 32gb storage windows 10 takes minimum finish getting setup
keyboard stopped working couple weeks searched online apparently common problem acer laptops still going troubleshooting return , trouble worth knew cheap laptop risk buy something little expensive waste time
runs fast gets low memory quick certain programs
frustrating , enough memory functional
sure able load anything
i'm really disappointed product brand new computer i'm problems , sending fake messages microsoft viruses , last time body almost still information get support n't trust call phone number ask call
terrible product stopped working month half laptop dead , would turn warranty , sent acer , said buy new one pay regular price terrible product terrible customer service
fast browsing great online work even enough memory necessary updates buy external hard drive choose something else
would recommend ! purchased christmas gift used 35 min shut , charged reset never turned back ! waiting replacement amazon hope defective well !
bought computer use personal use one worst purchases ever made user friendly extremely hard navigate also enough space simply update windows thinking purchasing new computer highly recommend look elsewhere
good slow
good pc worth
bought feb 2018 never worked properly windows never updated 've deleting recommended still cannot get windows update inexpensive laptop , even worth able use
bad top price wish little storage
return slow grey lines would flash front screen often
memory pretty crappy , got school internet access able write papers long n't save anything , laptop want
worst purchase made amazon hard drive big enough make windows updates plug flash drive space hard drive complete updates screen shuts every time plug cord terrible laptop
ca n't handle much anything system reboots much happens
barely use memory space
horrible space get low storage message within week using laptop good access microsoft office internet , serves purpose save money looking serious business laptop
looking forward computer based reviews got total disappointment first computer crashed first time turn later screen went dark stay dark recommend product
absolutely bare bones computer , price tag match ram \( 4 gb \) storage \( 32 gb \) extremely limited , non , though sd slot use external storage \( aware cards stick slot use , leaving traveling ill advised \) processor speed graphics also minimal n't gaming , photo video editing , heck , really even video watching , since storage limited , though streams ok , least via youtube good price conscious folks need second \( third , etc \) laptop hand browsing occasional video stream kids young , , computers \( 3 10 \) , also things school \( chromebooks \) 'd like home , like browser learning games , streaming sites , etc simple tasks , say , occasional email , perfect 've got one kid ipad home 's primary computer , happens fairly often , offers low cost third option quickly order something amazon , play math game school required typing tests 's also low cost enough allows let kids work semi \( like , standing whole time \) , without worrying dropping , breaking keys , etc , yes , things already occurred laptops past , learned lesson , one n't potential replacement repair cost 's quite disposable , comparison macbook pro ipad , almost feels way yes , get pay , want low cost , frills browsing email laptop runs windows , good deal , decent screen keyboard price \( , yes , apple household , think kids os also way cheap \)
comes , even enough memory open internet microsoft word ended buying different computer
sleek easy carry around , 's user friendly limited storage even browsing researching
sd card stuck far safe , pretty much reason n't keep
incredible battery life use way laptop pc
never held charge disappointed product carefully read says i'm used blue screens one gave white one \? ! \?
beautiful laptop ram crap 28 gb absurd amount space laptop found buy 1 tb external hard drive sd card fine
laptop worked great 3 days lost connection hard drive amazon support sent replacement right away hope replacement n't fail
's pretty good laptop price ca n't beat
great computer great price love !
terrible product crashed less month impossible windows due minimum disk space left
good thing machine looks like full size laptops , though advantage pretty light bad thing really limited , pretty minimal \( 32 gb \) storage whole lot processing power said , good computer basically want machine web browsing add microsoft office \( 100 \) , though n't know well would run screen pretty good sized would say colors fair , pretty good definition sound ok , nothing external speaker jack 3 usb ports suppose could hook small set speakers use headphones computer play computer taking 10 seconds start , played well screen pretty bright computer seems go 8 hours single charge said , remember computer 200 see good spare computer use web browsing give kids use ok , would wonder could spend one two hundred dollars get computer significantly capability said one gives basic functionality reasonable price
worth able update security also terrible love acer , spend money real model real software !
expect , paid like 200 dollars , something enough space like honestly expected
budget around 200 please save money purchase something better worth
buy , break tries update due memory buy amazon sell laptop
barely free space disk install apps update windows
performance , portable user friendly highly recommend acer products continued success
computer turns self wait turn back recommend computer

first , money , acer computers ca n't beat reasonable amount storage capable basic computing expecting 5000 laptop performance , disappointed laptop take summer home n't need carry laptop back forth every time great emails , internet basic computing think speed capabilities would someone uses work something requires lot capacity , though , bargain

acer computers waste money save something know last mine year already giving problems regular functions , loading , space use portable hard drive documents photos music save nothing actual computer yet system claims full memory lags minimal use save money ! ! ! bother acer product low quality low performance
fairly disappointed got acer , least inexpensive model supposed 32 gb memory , almost \( 80 \) used system files preloaded things , leaving virtually memory play deleting every app computer allowed delete , ability download maybe one desired app downloaded 2 n't even enough free memory computer update waste money , 'll admit need laptop browse web never plan saving anything actual computer well , would possibly work hand , security updates road might find memory filled guess get pay , n't think sell computer basically unusable

reasons buying purchased laptop homework \( college student \) well watch movies using external drive traveling fan tablets prefer typing papers keyboard windows operating system works well first impressions first laptop , small expected compact package , keyboard still easy type , buttons n't far classic laptop keyboard feel find , typing , turn touchpad resting hands seems move mouse mess \( easy fix \) touchpad responsive , left right clicking easy operate n't fight much like touch pads continued use happy battery life , even watching movies typing papers , use laptop day charge heat significantly like laptops \( assuming size \) quiet system typed 15 multi page essays laptop hands yet , 'd say great job design little space work overall would highly recommend laptop looking mobile work station , something view multimedia day small display makes difficult replace larger computer laptop , like would rather avoid pricey tablet , recommend bought , also came year long subscription microsoft office , absolute treat top machine
first laptop great starter laptops windows app store lacking lot good basics things need get done graphic okay outstanding speaker noticeable means need another option sound put like bluetooth speaker desktop speaker small means portable lightweight small perfect size font really tiny 'll adjust liking build durable keys great flimsy keys back lit 'll need light unless great eyes see dark track pad could bit confusing 'll get use buying another one soon chrome book 13 inch think google i'm used
like low cost laptops make everyone one two use different placed different use cases days pretty good far small , n't surprised screen portion bit flexible shall see durable battery life good rather responsive keyboard reasonable use fair typing feel light carry around small enough fit exterior finish shiny quite reflective noted picks placed direct sunlight reflect enough uncomfortable look
hate windows 10 think one change windows 7 8 i'm sure yet n't time check great looking laptop , great quality , 's pretty light everything great laptop except speed 's slow side got price went paid 200 bucks 's worth main reason bought mobile wifi sometimes need take laptop go smaller laptops like affect keyboard size extra space sides laptop really n't need totally great go , sometimes small enough slip bag big enough nice laptop
1 4 cost asus failed completely startup one 1 4 hassle thin easy pack , easy set i'm 70 , 5 3 , still much enjoy travel n't need want heavier laptop one fits easily large purse seems ideal set simple asus feature \( compare phone amazon fire \) came loaded 1 year microsoft office window 10 199 i'm hooked !

using school work computer \( rather large \) personal computer decided needed separate pc personal use purchased asus e200ha i'm using asus typing , email , general web browsing home coffee i'm grad student \( \) excessive amount typing , browsing , emailing little asus works perfectly tasks purchased separate 32gb micro sd card store papers far good add computer warehouse deal purchased good condition item arrived one tiny little hardly noticeable previous owner must updated windows 10 startup less 10 minutes , 5 minutes updates install touchpad features computer missing , installation took less 5 minutes microsoft office come installed , could free 1 year trial , got software free university n't concern read reviews stating updating windows 10 used computer 's storage , computer arrived 16gb free storage issue recent windows update previous windows files kept backup , automatically deleted month manually delete files want free lot space pros extremely lightweight carry around one hand easily travel lot meetings i'm definitely looking forward lug heavy work laptop battery life lasts 6 hours never use 4 5 hours time without charging n't know long actually lasts , indicates 11 hours charge time surprisingly responsive snappy 've read negative reviews crashing , n't case mine chrome installed , ram hog , pages load quickly youtube videos stream without lag sleek nice design ! actually looks like costs twice much ! screen good fair bad viewing angles , deal breaker n't mind adjusting lid cons keyboard little bit n't fast , type decently pressing little harder keys also small spaced looks cool tad unnecessary given lack space touchpad always consistent soft clicking response works best certain areas hard clicking towards bottom touchpad , much near top may want invest good mouse big con two stick behind lid cant open lid computer resting flat surface without surface computer n't rest four rubber feet lid open , instead rests front two feet two lid \( whatever want call \) really annoying overall great little laptop perfect college students need computer heavy processing like excel , video photo editing , gaming perfect web browsing , video streaming , microsoft word , second device travel would recommend !
lightweight notebook computer , running windows 10 , , good price two problems although really like solid state drive quick startup , size 32 gigs limiting basic programs greatly reduced dropbox size , 's working room windows updates , even 1 tb external drive connected 'd remove dropbox files allow update , gets much trouble i'm finding , though , get along fine installed version windows 10 , i'm giving big updates two , concern process occasions computer shut \( usually leave home , traveling shut \) difficult turn back suspect mechanical switch , last time happened removed back around , put back started perhaps sometimes needs gentle get fired
work tend away office lot runs word open office perfect solidly built , n't feel like i'm going break use carry everything need also two web browsers open multiple tabs including facebook youtube open , computer handles fine regrets purchase

great little laptop ! 's extremely portable , battery lasts long time sure , sometimes gets little laggy several tabs , expected inserted sd card 's keep files decided would purchase i'm studying abroad want heavy 1 , 000 laptop overseas probably good main laptop , definitely great side travel computer
bought laptop lightweight secondary computer traveling result , used lightly 14 months since purchase everyday use computer unable keep basic tasks browsing machine would probably work well older operating system installed , bloated windows 10 , n't sufficient windows 10 updates optional , 32gb hard drive huge updates immediately constantly bogs computer additional performance issues , machine poorly constructed found hard way , screen delicate unfortunately made mistake paying new screen instead cutting month later , screen stopped responding still lights , wo n't display anything touch pad never worked well , somehow , often right click rather left click vice plenty glitches , freezes , crashes despite using stock configuration virtually computer insanely light excellent battery life least advertised put sleep leave bag week open plenty charge left made excellent application issues convenience
personally , like laptop initially , thought perfect laptop simple web browsing , got laptop started browsing like speed browsing pages load slowly despite super good internet connection processor often touches 100 capacity slows laptop recommended returned laptop
little computer good value price little disappointed quickly started slowing 've 6 months , already takes forever load webpages \( pretty snappy first arrived \) 's probably computer thing need look , would hoped would despite low price
returned skeptical reviews saying n't enough memory even update windows , true couple weeks kept giving error messages n't enough space update n't download much onto , microsoft office , necessity since student saved files removable drive , even basic operating system much small amount storage space might good someone web based stuff , 're going need download even basic stuff , n't buy laptop
thing goes everywhere , good battery life worries leaving charger home complaint speakers 're tinny n't get loud , 200 'll bring headphones asus warranty also pretty fantastic
's good buy i'm college student needed something papers send emails 's neat compact lightweight easy carry around
got exactly advertised works well boot speed pretty fast couple months use dropping star due touch pad right click stopped working still tap 2 fingers still good storage runs keep reinstalling windows every months try bunch free memory windows updates keeps away unable recover much storage however laptop performs fine play games like runescape lowest graphics smoothly left 4 dead overall still good buy expect much storage best external say worth money still time laptop worth 400 get far better one acer ddr4 ram support 350 touch pad laptop attempted fixed touch pad making work perfect since right clicking issue hitting laptop laptop pretty good dont pay 400 paid 200 right id say worth 250 since get far better one im back 5 stars since everything works decided add another review months products still functions perfectly fine !
bought use feel like working need several tabs open creating document , complaints processing speed n't need graphics heavy work gaming ca n't speak , perfect use
little laptop exceeded expectations price keyboard really good , type fast using hours bought laptop traveling size first saw laptop realized really handy 's small weight much point believe one book could heavy really good computer college students son played time considering buying college computer price specs okay browse internet tabs open , watch videos programs open run smoothly , recommend computer anyone wants use traveling college students needs type papers use internet
super lightweight , enough space basics need student comes windows 10 small , reliable sometimes issue finding wifi , restarting almost always fixes bug
typing 's faster expected expect use lot travel battery life seems 10 hours movies fine sound better expected use mostly simple spread sheets keyboard fine , works well mouse 've added 64gb microsd , n't use ca n't put regular hdmi slot \? main thing n't like windows 10 , specifically new photo program , significantly worse previous one wish knew get old one back
fantastic lightweight computer go work need get full pc access programs ca n't properly download tablet phone looked many small twice price found performance lightweight machine work perfectly full day working machine , great travel , short work car kids everything big machine much smaller package
wish would read os os version shipped terrible although laptop performed expected purchased niece ask opinion update review
delivered time , great product good quality much cheaper price i'm impressed battery life , lasts 13 hours love carry around 's lightweight love everything except minor comes windows 10 os sometimes \( really often though , rarely happens \) freezes wake sleep mode long press power button laptop 's fault though , laptop much powerful specs also freezes like i'm planning downgrade os despite tiny problem , 'd still buy even know purchase anyway , overall , 's awesome ! bang buck !
great laptop price annoying much space main hard drive , got sd card insert battery life power saver lasts 10 hours light work bought size also great easy carry around take much desk space
's ok price would hoped system would booted faster , sometimes system slow time pretty responsive need expandable memory buy windows hard drive space mechanical problems far n't tested webcam keyboard small nice like touchpad display pretty good watched 720p video far
update see original review 's year i'm finally space fine buy storage \( ie micro sd card \) 're buying mostly cloud based laptop go know 're space would definitely purchase stand five star review n't want review sure i'm certain computer 's lightweight , affordable , pretty look even found matching wireless mouse 've laptop little month enjoy fast use word processing mostly blogging fact also add storage micro sd card also big win i'm thinking purchasing external hard drive storage n't run cons far watch videos , write , worry lag 's light carry one hand color n't shiny gold n't care would recommend anyone 's fence purchasing
needed thin light weight completely silent amazing battery life use email , surfing web , microsoft excel , linux server \( \) tasks , little system enough power size right fit man purse shoulder bag \( actually , joke ! \) given opportunity , would built ram give system little room \( currently using little 3rd party installed \) , said , i'm fine
great computer ! got computer 's prior model four years ago lasted backpack college 4 years surprised could lightweight also durable actually never issues previous computer except eventually outdated technology since needing pay 100 get microsoft office anyway , figured would get computer basically , got 100 quality computer
great netbook ! performance issues running great weeks tell better made cheaper lower quality machines aware netbook , laptop basically means smaller , lighter , less powerful full laptop exactly need wanted
fresh box 's running incredibly slow must gotten bad one \( many reviewers seems \) , computer specs decent plenty reviewers say runs fast , currently running google chrome nothing else even slow checked task manager 80 90 cpu usage 70 memory running web browser ! unacceptable try run 3 tabs 's game something ai n't right
love works perfectly except n't come touch pad driver strange easily fixed really like , good screen , good keyboard , fast processor \( browsing youtube \) , either primary backup pc great buy
needed small footprint pc could take something could carry along writing pad perfect big concern need run pretty programs including dragon naturally speaking scrivener processor handles programs fine another concern old pc used max range one delivers consistently equipment nice ! next concern limited drive space use 32 gb programs great , keep files cloud \( one drive icloud \) sweet ! final concern keyboard would large enough accommodate power typing designers away unneeded keys , leaves plenty space typing good performance fast old pc plenty drive space program nice keyboard great price i'm pleased
look , 's lot value , n't get wrong little bit cost operating system \( os \) , get whole computer one feature laptop makes work trackpad awful garbage source frustration ever experienced electronics 's garbage 's accuracy poor , 's poor , 's multi finger input clumsy , every stops working entirely good buy want also carry around mouse
really like works great includes office ram twice price range atom core fast put 32 gb micro sd installed portable apps save native hd space still 11 gb free space installing dropbox syncing use one drive format micro sd
unfortunately , positives laptop mouse touch pad often cursor disappears 've gone settings tried adjust touch pad settings luck 's effort enjoy good features mouse cursor work usb wired mouse get full benefit product unfortunate i'm seriously considering returning item
originally planned going chromebook , trying couple , realized sluggish browser based chromeos way slow enter laptop , complete windows 10 zero learning curve , fast browsing good around machine meet needs anyone n't power user \( expecting use gaming , video editing graphic memory intensive programs obviously going end disappointment \) , however expectations battery life speed light use ultimately , choose system horsepower wanted something age bit better price range , get much value blows every chromebook water
laptop build quality phenomenal price however specs sub par lots random wifi issues also problem glitches open lid battery life great , keyboard comfortable , trackpad bad spend around 100 get i3 dell laptop surely last longer
good lap top \( chromebook \) plenty file space need store everything flash drive anyway processor fast enough online gaming , use lot different things gaming got works fine complaints
like overall look feel laptop , unfortunately quite problems 1 keyboard level key obviously lower rest 2 loses drive \( sd card \) every 20 minutes , rendering useless laptop useful without sd card 3 touchpad great reboot , becomes 20 minutes use happened many times using file explorer \( nearly results \) could decent laptop , would n't know unfortunately problems make laptop unusable sadly 's isolated case 4 asus laptops sitting house right three similar issues touchpad , two issues losing drive zenbook issues gpu overheating \( even though fan \) features initially , fatal flaws kept useful asus , please keep current configuration , perhaps hdd space keep lightweight good battery life fix issue sticky touchpad \( accidentally deleted files many times \) usb3 thumb drives work \( lost whole drive worth data \) overall better quality control willing pay fix problems
im actually currently using product right bought year ago price darn good laptop runs pretty well mostly use word school work browsing say even saved wanting purchase mac glitches reality price gets job done runs well significant storage camera questionable youre video chatting sufficient though lags little price well worth
size , speed , weight perfect carry around however , hard drive ca n't much running application tried search size bigger hard drive luck like asus hope manufacture could keep features bigger hard drive 4k sd adapter card cost 25
purchased laptop wife early christmas present far performed expected , slight speed using web browsing light photo editing defect present note review asus product 'd expect nothing less quality item 've never issue products

little hesitant buy laptop online without trying store reasons , figured could return free , hell give go pros display nice , seems pretty sturdy , size really great students , battery life good , 2 instead one like others , keyboard nice feel , weight really light , mouse either responsive weird zoom scroll thing \( n't figured disable ended getting bluetooth one mouse instead \) , hard drive smaller would like , i'm happy think value definitely money 's nice something easily portable n't require full computer bag
great little machine , occasional problem 'll go take soft reset 's always fine comes back purchase 128gb memory card 's fine everything 've needed far time still solid everyday use surf shop mostly father plays online flawlessly , quickly ease top , gold soft light may slightly silver 's gold
powered computer goes set click use express settings reboots goes infinite loop rebooting believe r team created computer wanted asus terrible computer ever owned
absolutely phenomenal laptop low price code thing fine small simple programs got usb hdd along get something big going save hard drive run later big machine plays 5 like charm low settings , random games mostly pretty stuff \( \) web browsing chrome feel sluggish times , note though feel really job well pros small sleek design pretty awesome battery , went something like 4 hours one day 5 without plug good keyboard tactile , mushy , well spaced keys low touchpad works , screen really imagine weight real think speakers , mean headphones nowadays
computer slow cannot handle many tabs open also find battery anywhere near advertised level
bought traveling died first time took somewhere , leaving without way transfer pictures make travel would also take forever read data card put , n't know defective asus screwed , lost customer rest life update got working \( apparently sensitive hold power button minute release extra \) installed windows 10 entire hard drive 's right people asus sold computer os bigger entire drive less year bought computer february already hold os asus know would happen \? believe paid 200 dollars february , want 400 december 2017 horrible company sell computer wo n't even hold os charged 200 february , windows 10 much smaller , know computer worthless size win 10 grown , yet doubled price company , buy ! ! ! !

laptop computer purchased daughter take back college old one cracked screen saw loves smaller , compact last
great computer ! 's gaming computer anything , price purpose school 's excellent really sleek look , smooth windows 10 operating system free year apparently october april \? office better nothing though free 's kind whatever would definitely recommend students
maybe n't lucky laptop sometimes cursor would disappear called technician , suggested buy wireless mouse , however , another problem screen would go black leave alone days would start working n't powering \(
great little laptop asus 's life saver away main computer , stuff need keep household things order ordered mouse work much easier
received laptop today hours touchpad stopped working long story short , seems known issue asus touchpad updating windows 10 writing , trying get everything downloaded away finally deciding return \( went online looked issue plenty help available \) 's shame n't work form little far , actually surprised screen quality 's really nice touchpad feels like glass run fingers great looking device however , update results update months usage say laptop unusable little memory useful anything ca n't even support microsoft windows updates without running space windows wo n't let users put apps another drive , memory gone n't know thought customers would able use thing n't waste time far many choices products find something actually works
got computer right old lenovo crashed right final exams i'm college student looking something functional , inexpensive , durable cheap , neither durable functional part 've 4 months i'm already looking replacement 's incredibly slow even basic things next storage space apps , documents , programs , photos , etc problems blue screens randomly shuts must restart problem pc speakers n't always work wireless driver \( allows connect wifi \) n't always recognized n't consistent internet , poorly designed product fairly useless
love light portable issue finding compatible sd card n't want buy wrong one posted never got response would n't recommend gaming pc 's great need use internet type documents papers
would buy got older one 's work better streamlined one almost full 10 takes many resources think n't seem run fast older one win 7
needed something light small able perform tasks build quality impressive , performance ok price , sound surprising , battery life amazing installed programs apps 64gb microsd card , left free c drive

hard drive storage small 32 gigs \( small \? lol \) , n't need lot space bought write book , 'll fine micro sad card slot found 512 card \( yes , 's 512 \) , n't really need much space , 'll probably use something smaller , use somewhere else
screen leaves something desired perfect casual user though
never written review , shocked see extremely good reviews product laptop 2 days began problem opened laptop sleep mode backlit black tried many different ways wake , turn , let battery die problem finally able bring login screen shut using power button , screen button , track pad common pinch zoom capability constantly moving cursor lag track pad also issue try correct zoom 4 5 second lag ends way well , scrolling function track pad horrible either jumps 10 pages moves incredibly slowly applications take ages open added single one anything came laptop , get slower absolutely returning 150 samsung chromebook needed excel however , chromebook far superior

disappointed came great portability battery life good stats price unfortunately , 6 months , crashing continuously additionally , difficulty finding wifi networks
great size , plenty speed criticism , far , couple keys come loose
first let say spent time trying find exactly looking nervous restocking fees amazon n't happy , decision heavy 11 year old looking computer wanted something smaller regular laptop would right size also , since 11 , want spend great deal money enough , could find many 15 6 inch laptops around 200 , anything smaller fell ones could around become tablets therefore crazy expensive tried lenovo flex 3 , 2gb ram could n't even load webpage without memory 100 saw netbook never really anti netbook person knew n't bought used google extensions suggested another review , son extremely happy loads every page wants allows type papers \( using google suite save limited space \) also , size perfect 200 4gb ram , exactly needed want multiple position one touchscreen , would , still accept nothing short 4gb ram know pay features
got computer work opened around around start page closing starting update two days later deal one anyone
got laptop week ago looks operates like much expensive machine n't let 32gb storage bother installed 128 gb micro sd card add external dvd \( 30 \) almost storage cloud anyway way devices , phone etc connected quick nice feeling keyboard good bargain comes office 365 year would definitely buy ! second asus told wife spent hundred eyes look like 600 device n't ms surface n't surface price tag either great travel good battery life recommend ! back using computer constantly little concerned 32gb storage anymore put gb samsung micro sd card went storage selected sent micro sd card select 5 new apps , documents , music , photo videos new movies tv shows keep mind , photos , videos , docs cloud plenty storage os took half 32gb good news ! windows 10 upgrades take 90 cd drive n't 10 days old windows 10 files automatically removed c drive leaving free space sure put docs , photos etc micro sd card cloud drop box \( installed 128gb micro sd card \) cloud sd card windows 10 apps c drive works fine
purchased replacement asus got last year , performance amazing ! struck display color difference everything saturated sharper laptop thoroughly enjoy 4gb compared standard 2gb computers size self tab , 2gb tends go past 8 tabs especially shopping , able open 20 tabs incredibly helpful another thing helps performance processing heavy sites previous computer flat refused , one n't complain adore small size , allows type normal keyboard , gives essentially portability tablet mean , thing fits purse ! someone mobility issues , ridiculously light weight computer wonderful pretty much negative things say little rubber feet bottom asus 11 6 's tend slide fairly quickly \( three four months \) , need transfer music via usb rather direct rip , n't optical drives fairly obvious 're picture , 're going need external hard drive , much cheaper used ! incredible price , 4gb 11 6 inch gonna impossible find elsewhere grab one !
great except small hard drive become problem i'm unable update windows 10 due enough hard drive space said needed 8gb free , uninstalled ms office \( 1gb \) leaving 9gb free 's still enough , update failed times
worst laptop ever owned worked customer service non existent start repairing disc error reinstalling os extremely slow many times load website touch pad impossible use absolutely useless positive point looks nice use thinking buying , n't wanted give stars wo n't let
would give zero stars could used computer 5 times since purchased end july stored air home optimal conditions end september , already n't work \( wo n't turn \) asus unable resolve via support line want send , want refund never touch another asus product life unbelievably dissatisfied product buy
good results thus far issues yet , write review based 2hrs use
never starts right away purchased one reason , computer access work related website use windows computer never starts right away , usually takes almost hour boot
laptop lasted month one day died n't turn back
ordered , came broken would n't turn sent new one took 10 minutes load could n't even set , took long ended returning buying dell even though cheap , n't worth
worst computer ever come contact life freezes everytime plug external hard drive minimum i'm working music constantly freezes , movies freeze ca n't get anything done ever unfortunately , live cannot return cannot get another computer i'm stuck suggest customers spend little bit anything computer
disappointed absolutely space laptop neat lightweight buy memory card absolutely space

ordering laptop amazon specifically search touch screen laptop received touch screen wish search engine work better

small laptop 11 really one needs computer basic projects , word processing , excel spreadsheets would suggest something slightly larger person larger hands keyboard adequate , slightly cumbersome windows 10 utilized touchscreen , used touchscreen touchscreen provides decent battery life 4 5 stars perfect much desire left unsatisfied
computer ready use first plugged took 5 hours updates could use finally logged , realized arrived antivirus software installed activity background protection installed amazon needed

hard drive little bit slow works great video editing i5 8th generations works awesome
price really nice looking use engineering purposes requirements
computer wonderful great investment keep mind computer may run bit slow first due fact windows 10 installs updates computer without first slow downloads also cannot download steam browse web time steam issue computer games run well computer turn graphics game
screen quite , battery like feel mouse pad lack buttons sound quality nice specs good bargain despite ssd non version pretty satisfied
's really pretty laptop keys feel absolutely wonderful currently though 100 disk usage issue \( got laptop \) slows bit also , feels really sluggish 're trying things quickly partly lack ssd feel like open stick ram stick ssd everything fine trackpad buttons 're used might little difficult use 's kind loud click , n't feel like 's great quality perspective laptop 've ever touched 300 however range still nice trackpad

laptop horrible recommend using game slow even surf web opening applications word lagging period work
ok gaming laptop price , bottleneck 1tb 5 , hdd ! ! ! part , performs like regular 5 , 400 rpm drive mainly , installing games programs , could painfully slow ! decided drive spare ssd , difference like day night ! ! ! already used ssd , strongly recommend buy version laptop comes ssd already installed buy one later , 'll grateful decision , rest hardware good laptop feels ok intended purpose
got lemon first , 'll need install 2 ssd otherwise thing take forever boot install steam games , thing 100 disk usage without many issues , drivers installed updated , speakers made popping sound randomly worst issue gtx 1050 graphics card working , updated , shown device manager , yet games used yes , tried many solutions internet , switching nvidia panel settings , reinstalling windows , reinstalling drivers , nothing worked explained asus , wanted send , take month , forever , 'll return hopefully get another lemon
's alright easy set drawbacks , black keyboard , hard see dim light reminds black interior , drop something ca n't find ca n't see anything hp really made lighted keyboard number lock button , light typing password anything , pay attention make sure numbers typing light caps lock numbers lock hp \? , nice computer , second day using 's keeper despite dark keyboard light number lock good speakers sound battery life , charged one hour ten minutes ago 's good battery life
bought replace 8 gb ram , real workhorse tho intel core i3 \( 3rd gen \) boy miss unit core i5 \( 7th gen \) faster fact , even 12 gb ram wait get things done running home business lot word processing digital photo editing maybe problem w10 \( like \) slow sure may go one kids may keep looking hp work keep trying find slowing
computer less 6 months old hard drive failed , number amazon call n't work cant even get model number serial number hp says help serial number cant find hard drive working say amazon confirmed take back refund money

alright computer gets job done offer excellent visual viewing videos listening music also offers full keyboard functionality making documents even dvd drive video viewing beyond , kind good desktop replacement type work reminds type used 10 years ago , big clunky ones laptops could sit lap , honestly wouldnt want heavy big unlike thinner frame lighter ssd ones disc drives , one opted put back , went big screen , touch screen features deliver maximum price think great first laptop college folks wouldnt really use actual portable pc unless im always going able put desk table viewing angle screen could better , really get good view youre sitting head , youre sitting even degrees center get washed view

amazing computer given price system turn anyone plays overwatch runs power plugged roughly running type run multiple things background playing games , would recommend 16gb ram found 8gb barely enough one application open time heavier expected carry around anyone wants use classes play games , enough , long mind weight

far complaints 2 weeks far laptop beyond expected sure getting wrong graphics card mine definitely ti mostly use laptop steam games streaming online far runs rocket league highest graphics settings also running webcam software great laptop price !
far 've totally enjoying experience laptop came parts needed install additional ssd hdd bought separately cost efficient might add buying laptop 1tb hdd preinstalled laptop overheated ran benchmark tests laptop well played 6 hours straight games lol , 2 , overwatch , full settings give updates upon change takes place
great gaming laptop plays aaa games fault suggestion ordering , order 2tb hdd \( 7mm \) little space little bloatware , since startup system ssd , boots quite fast
wrong model sent reseller , issue resolved amazon computer worth 5 stars superior expensive msi got around time much better screen , even bit dim pros great hardware price , seems easy upgrade ram hdd great screen price great color contrast look washed like gaming laptop screens fast ssd built easy add extra hdd great battery life twice 've seen gaming laptops price range 8 hours settings reduced 2 hours playing mid range game cons enough take star , since still better models cost 200 keyboard bit cramped take getting used screen little dim sunlight
ti version gpu , hdd kit cable pre installed screen bottom flexible though press lightly back front pops 25 hell otherwise seems ok built n't highest quality decent budget laptop thing literally boots 5 seconds log screen update little gaming \( \) performed well fans little loud , doesnt get warm though latency used wifi poor strength router side house

want say acer done extremely well marketing essentially mid range gaming computer good price point indeed including shipping , able get machine told , excellent computer quad core i5 1050ti machines identical specifications retail upwards 900 dollars yet disappointed 've thrown almost best games , including 's war \( 2013 \) idea factory 's \( 2017 \) computer , handles almost flawlessly 1080p maximum settings , uses unreal 4 engine , hiccups new effects come play , otherwise system holds barely noticeable noise heat never drops machine want want budget gaming laptop truly lives advertising hype nvidia gtx 1050ti able handle items coming within next years medium high settings 1080p least next 3 5 years said , computer gets four rather five stars couple reasons first , chassis solid well made , ips screen bit dim , plastic frame feels bit fragile 's certainly made durable material actual chassis second , audio seems bit function extra subwoofer bass settings seem added audio card , makes audio bit less clear older computer , hp 17 model , purchased 800 december 2016
acer nitro 5 feels fragile constant fear breaking part fact dropped , told , 750 piece equipment makes worry things , bigger part 's simply cheaply made laptop looks great paper , know cut corners somewhere , right \? well acer decided sacrifice build quality , shows well , n't show , 's problem wo n't realize 's cheaply made actually get hands feel usb ports plug something wonder 're going break , place laptop bag serious ability hold simple foot travel terms hardware really good deal , 's reason laptops category go several hundred dollars built last n't mine came defective screen significant backlight bleed \( yellow light around edges screen show dark colors displayed \) got worse weeks owned acer would cover replacement screen warranty asked send wanted pay shipping , asked cover shipping ways manufacturing defect , without hassle i'm upset brand new pc defective ship repairs returned instead could trust build quality acer good brand save get predator instead 3 stars laptop 's actually bad star poor quality control

previous owner asus ux31a bought mid 2013 finally , liked bought one replacement though fine changes first , one open nearly much ux31a ux31a would open almost 150 degrees , one 130 degrees already run operating situations miss old spec instance laptop kitchen counter standing use really want extra opening angle second , ux31a power supply made two would fold back body power great threw carry case would anything new one stick 's ux31a came slip case one finally speakers ux31a bar front function keys one come bottom case sound muffled mind 3 poor design one cheap cost saving disappointed known things would looked around purchasing
2 stars n't like , true cheaply made first one issue sound , could n't hear internal speaker headphones one , frame screen screen together another issue sounds like wire loose hit fan also , often runs hot browser open netflix running operate linux partition avoid last issue must use windows sad last asus laptop less expensive ran much better best thing thing long battery life nice display , overall 's worth
fan loud months one annoying thing mcafee subscription guess asus thing computer protection thing called mcafee months pops annoyingly forces pay mean guess hoping windows already something \? really \? lol overall laptop fine reminds apple laptops bad fingerprint reader nice wish speakers top awesome idk like love

love computer lightweight , reasonable , great battery life first one got sticky key right box amazon replaced , next computer track pad problem customer service helpful 2 3 times walked process setting driver told full system set took bunch time pay install software , one week later track pad cut i'm preparing send least shipping ways covered , i'm going without computer least two weeks trackpad cutting seems like issue couple users based reviews , seeing problem week starts working , i'm really concerned ability resolve long fingers sending works , two issues concern basic quality made switch since apple laptops gotten ridiculously expensive , basic quality issues brand new computer 's still great computer , concern
bought laptop beginning college semester 've 7 months working really well first , months , started freeze often whenever , mouse would n't move , keys press n't make difference , also produces strange sound would restart every time happening frequently student , essential laptop use i'm beginning think getting new one different brand

computer disappointment looks beautiful extremely light portable caused nothing trouble within year 've replace battery \( little support asus despite multiple \) keys regularly stick computer shuts randomly sleep mode , frequently switch drain battery night 've taken multiple people check fixes serious hardware flaws , one quite figure problem i'm quite gentle devices carry cases , keep clean relatively dust free , update software including malware protection regularly whatever reason , asus continued let mention absolutely zero customer service buying new computer soon returning asus products definitely worth pay 300 macbook air
